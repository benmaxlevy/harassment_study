0,"ill get straight to the point: one of my biggest limit in life is -what i think it is- extreme anxiety. im not just talking about feeling nervous or sweating or something like that. im talking about trouble talking and serious auto sabotaging.

here some example related to my main activities:

1) i could study a piece of music 1000 times. i could play it perfectly in my home alone, or even if im aware that ppl are passively listening to me. but i swear, if someone is, let say, behind me purposefully listening to what i play, my memory start vacillating, my brain start hurting and becomes kinda numb and white, and i suddenly waste hour and hour of studying and practicing, thus resulting incompetent and imprecise.

2) the same happens when i act. especially in theatres, because it includes my whole body. i am a professional actress and ive performed a lot, but this cannot go on. im not enjoying fully what i do and i live throughout every performance with severe anguish. this is not how i want to work. this is not how i carry on. there like a limiting virus in my brain that turn on whenever i am in a performative stage. or in a performative situation. i could study whatever and for many many hours, but id be worried about my memory and my body would be sorta freezed. i do not feel free, im always subconsciously and consciously controlling that nothing slip out. the only time when i fully felt free wa when i drank on stage for a sorta drunk-sluggish character. in that moment i forgot about everything and truly felt everything i said and lived the scene with my whole self. this being said, i do not intend on becoming an alcoholic, i want to resolve the root of the problem.

3) same old shit happens when i sing. i have a very strong voice,  but when i sing in public or at exam i always have to force myself to get it out. it stay in, tucked in, it wont come out a much. it like an auto shrinking mechanism. and i feel so so bad, because i know what i can do, but others cannot see it fully and that doe not help.

i dont exactly know what it is, but i have the feeling that listening to some type of subliminal could drastically help me with this. of course if you have alternative on how to resolve this, let me know. im very open to try different approaches.

1,"i dont know if anyone else ha noticed this also, but this year ha been absolutely insane with colds, viruses, etc. prior to this year id only get sick maybe once every 2/3 years. this year i have gotten very sick about 4 times, one of which might have been the c word. a few of my friend have also had quite a few cold this year and also find it odd.
before this, i wasnt too worried, not even about covid. but now, im extremely anxious about it. i over wash my hands, try to keep my distance if someone ha a cough, etc
has anyone else noticed this?",anxiety
2,"anyone else feel secondhand embarrassment so intensely that it affect your entire wellbeing?

it feel even worse than my embarrassment for myself. maybe it's because i've become good at making myself ""invisible"", like i take comfort from the fact that most people don't even notice me or care about me at all, and i actively avoid putting myself in the kind of situation where i could risk serious embarrassment. but a a result of my own empty life i've begun living vicariously through other more public people who do not shy away from putting themselves out there, and i guess i'm also projecting all my anxiety onto them.

i hate it because i derive so much comfort from following people who inspire me but then it always turn into a trigger i need to avoid when i end up constantly freaking out about what other people think about them. doe anyone know how to deal with it? i go through this loop so often and i can't handle it anymore.",anxiety

4,"hi everyone. im dealing with a situation with my healthcare provider that just pissed me right off, and id like to share.

&amp;#x200b;

been trying different anxiety med for a while, trying to find one that work well and doesnt delete my sex drive. recently i tried zoloft, and actually had really good result - very effective, tolerable side effects. 

&amp;#x200b;

then i got serotonin syndrome.

&amp;#x200b;

i take other med that mess with serotonin, and all of them in combination wa too much. we immediately slashed my zoloft dose from 200 mg to 50, which fixed thatbut nothing else ive tried ha been anywhere near a effective. my anxiety got much harder to manage, and the latest med im trying, lyrica, hasnt helped.

&amp;#x200b;

i got in touch with my provider through secure e-messaging, asking for a med change. i told her that zoloft wa by far the most effective thing ive ever tried and asked if i could adjust my other med to make room for it.

&amp;#x200b;

she seemed receptive at first, even enthusiastic about helping me find a solution. then this morning i got a dear john letter saying that she cant provide the care i need, and i should go to a specialist for further help with behavioral health care.

&amp;#x200b;

thats fine, i get it. but her tune had totally changed -from supportive and respectful to dismissive and rote. she said that no med wa going to be a magic solution, and that i needed to talk to a specialist to work on behavioral interventions, like it something im not doing.

&amp;#x200b;

i use other interventions. she know this, so being told to do consider doing them sound like i dont believe you or if you were \*actually\* trying youd be better.  and after her being so helpful and supportive, having her turn around and tell me that im demanding a magic solution and need to manage my unrealistic expectation wa a slap in the face.

&amp;#x200b;

ive had provider before who dismissed or belittled my concerns, and it sucked. i already struggle with anxiety pulling me down a dark hole where everything is out to get me, and this kind of thing make it so much worse.

&amp;#x200b;

being made to doubt myself this way make me feel like a crazy person. it sound like im being told that the way i feel is imaginary and it would go away if i just tried harder. it feel like im being told that my view of my life is demonstrably wrong, and im only handling it the way i am because im a nut case.

&amp;#x200b;

this dissonance between my lived experience and how my provider characterizes it fuel massive self-doubt. it also enrages me to be talked to like i just dont understand my lived experience and how it affect me.  

&amp;#x200b;

im so twisted up between anxious self-doubt and anger at being dismissed \*again\* that i dont even know which one im ranting about right now. i guess i just need to feel heard, but i dont want to dump all this on anyone in my life until ive had a chance to cool down. lucky you!

6,"to give some background im a 28 year old woman. ive had anxiety/ocd ever since i wa a kid but it didnt really become bad until i wa around 24 when i had a bad experience smoking weed (ended up having panic attack on and off for month out of the blue.) 

to sum up my issue now, ever since i had covid last year my anxiety ha been through the roof. the only physical symptom ive really dealt with were feeling like i cant breath and my heart racing. but that all seemed to change a few month ago after my dog of 14 year died. i allowed myself to grieve and i honestly think i handled it pretty well. after a few week i noticed my anxiety wa getting worse. im not even sure if it connected to my dog passing but it could be one of the element and im sure some long covid symptoms. but since then ive never been so hyper aware of my mental and physical health. im now starting to experience random body aches, head pressure, my hair wa shedding pretty two month ago a well. sometimes ill get so anxious i become super aware of my breathing and feel like i cant get a full breath, ive been doing everything possible to heal and and stay healthy. im currently on a carnivore diet which help immensely, ive been incorporating wim hof breathing and cold showers, i started going to the gym again. yet im still getting these random anxious symptoms. i just had my blood checked a couple of week ago and everything looked fine, my thyroid wa normal etc. im not sure if this is just a seasonal thing a i do tend to get more anxious and depressed during the winter months. my health anxiety now just assumes the worst. would love some advice. 

also side note i did begin microdosing psilocybin a few week ago which i think have been helping but who know maybe thats causing my tension headaches. theyre not severe and dont hurt it just a noticeable pressure like im wearing a headband.",anxiety

8,"[tw/sexual abuse] 

i'm a 28yo male. 15 year ago, when i wa 12, i sexually interacted with a 7 year old. i had an erection and asked him to sit on my lap, which he did, and in another occasion i tried to hug him from behind and then he pushed me or punched me in the dick, i don't remember exactly. i never tried anything again and his family moved sometime after (not for this reason). i think we were neighboors for two year in total, maybe three. i deeply regret it and guilt and anxiety are torturing me. i worry he's pissed about it to this day and might wanna get revenge on me by killing or torturing me (he's kinda involved with gang from what i saw looking through his social media). i got so scared and anxious thinking about it i even felt a out-of-reality kind of experience in one of the most intense episodes. sometimes i think about reaching out to him and apologizing but i'm scared i may make the situation worse if he doesn't even remember it or idk... what should i do?",anxiety

i didn't think that his microphone would pick up some minor noise in the kitchen, but it did and he's having trouble editing it out. immediately i got that metallic taste in my mouth, my ear started ringing and i started spiraling. what if he can't get it fixed? what if it throw him off schedule and they never record again? what if i have taken his fun hobby and turned it into a stressful one? it feel like everything wrong in his life start and end with me.

i don't know how to make it better. i've already apologized and said that it won't happen again... that i'll just go into the other room altogether while they record, but that doesn't change thing now. all he's said is that what's done is done, and i can't go back and change it so i shouldn't feel so guilty, but that doesn't change the fact that i do feel guilty. i'm already a monster and anxiety about thing just tends to make everything worse.",anxiety

i am not into abdl or something sexually about it - it just lower my stress/anxiety level and make me feel comfortable and protected. it all started when i (because of stress) wet the bed and then wore drynites for a couple of day just for protecting the mattress - and somehow recognised the protected feeling and stress relieve i get from having these on. i now feel really ashamed of myself and these thought and feeling :/ can anyone relate? or am i totally weird and somehow psychological sick or something? i would really love to hear your opinion on that!

15,"i've had anxiety for essentially my whole life. it used to be rather debilitating, but with a whole lot of therapy and working really hard at it i've gotten it to a managable level.


the issue is: the only way of dealing with it that work for me is 'ignoring' anxious thoughts. i've gotten great at *just not thinking about things* if they stress me out. unfortunately this extends to... everything. no matter how important, if the thought of something make me even slightly stressed i'll just not think about it. deadline (never been greater at procrastinating), events, memories, relationship - i'm ignoring my whole life at this point. 


by trying so hard to not feel the anxiety i've also stopped feeling a lot of other things. i don't have close relationship because i just... don't care about people all that much. that make me feel kind of lonely, but then again i can just suppress that feeling. i'm never really very happy, but also rarely sad. i have no strong emotions. it feel like there's something blocking anything but fleeting surface-level feelings. 

i'm honestly not sure if this tradeoff wa worth it. the anxiety is never truly gone anyway.


is this common and is there a way to stop doing it? i might get thing done like this but i can't live my life always just feeling numb.",anxiety

however, i seem to have a thing about being around others who drink now. it frightens me, and make me uncomfortable. i wonder if it to do with the fact ive been struggling with memory of a past event recently, although this event didnt have alcohol directly involved. so, im not actually 100% sure on where this come from. 

my partner and all of my friend like drinking; and it worry me that people may think i have a problem with them personally. i just see that more argument happen when people drink and i dont like seeing others switch and turn on each other. i also dont want anyone to think i expect them to not drink or change if they were to find out how i feel.

months ago i started getting having nightmare about living in that period again, a if my brain is telling me ""you're too happy now, what if i fuck it all up again ?"" which at first i brushed off cause it's just that, a nightmare. but i've been entertaining that train of thought a lot subconsciously, till a week ago where i couldn't take it anymore and had a massive panic attack...

since then every waking moment ha been pure pain, i've developped physical symptom such a rapid heartbeat, rapid breathing, struggling to focus etc...in short i can barely function anymore. i cry a lot every day cause i can't take it and part of me is deeply scared i'll never be able to recover no matter what, even if i resort to therapy. to clarify, it's not those bodily function that scare me anymore, but rather the vicious cycle of anxiety itself, and the fact my brain ha the ability to ruin me with such ease.

the fact i've been reading horror story on this subreddit and other site where people say they're struggling from anxiety for decade and have never been able to cope fuel my fear even more...

hi so i have been struggling with terrible intrusive thought about my marriage and myself lately. i am currently 17 week pregnant and ever since last month i have been having self doubt about my love for my husband. idk why this ha happened but ever since i became pregnant he ha been on my nerve lately and i all of a sudden got this intrusive thought maybe you dont love him and ever since then i have been anxious and distant with him . he isnt noticing anything yet because i have been hiding it but it really killing me because he such a wonderful husband and been my best support during this. i am so scared of losing him and have fear of a future without him. have anyone been through this with their pregnancy or anxiety and will this ever go away? because i really miss having a great time with him.",anxiety

i have started taking l-theanine, 200 mg once a day, occasionally up to 300 mg for the past 14 days.

the intention wa to help ease general anxious thought - specifically situational anxiety, (also leading up to an anxiety inducing event). i am not entirely sure my anxiety ha reduced however i have have been feeling lethargic / ""numb"" emotionally if that make sense. i have also been feeling sadder than usual. for example: i have cried / been on the verge of cry about 3/4 time in the past two week due to perceived stressors. (i might of cried once / twice in the past year aside from this).

57,"six month ago my depression went away on a friday. i wa 23 and never exactly knew that i wa chemically depressed until i experienced normal. i couldnt believe how light i felt. nothing felt wrong a it always had done before. everything had always seemed so weighty and impossible. i recall thinking it wa strange how i had no concept of what happiness meant.

and it wasnt just the depression and anxiety.

at the same time the muscle tension dysphonia affecting my voice fully resolved along with the cognitive impairment. all symptom have since intermittently appeared and disappeared together - always together at the exact same time. 

i didnt specifically know that i suffered from  these issue until i knew the difference. feeling depth in my voice without the gravelly quality and grating discomfort. being able to do math and remember phone numbers. thinking visually and effortlessly translating idea into speech without making mistake or stuttering. 

im seeing a psychiatrist next month and hopefully will try an snri + wellbutrin  however im concerned that these will not resolve the cognitive issue which are my main concern. until recently i believed it must be some type of fibromyalgia / neuroloinflammatory condition causing the slowed thinking, but after having read into the cognitive effect of anxiety and depression, it seems theyre likely the underlying cause. also met with a neurologist who said that he belief that gad is causing most of my symptom with the brain fog and mental blankness being particularly characteristic of anxiety.

i wa meditation and exercising daily for three year leading up to the breakthrough and had stopped both several week beforehand which is concerning because i dont know what else i can do beyond treatment for the anxiety and depression (if it not causal).  

does anyone have any recommendation for treatment option or any thought on how some of this may overlap with your own experiences?

when it come to driving other people, i get a lot of anxiety and get distracted easily. it like i completely forget how to drive and hyper focus on stuff like braking properly and the speed limit. i panic and get nervous, and then i cant think under pressure and drive dangerously. i hit curbs, make wrong turns, almost crash into things, and cant even park properly, which almost never happens when im alone. 

because im afraid to get into an accident and having my friends/familys life in my hands, i basically refuse to drive anyone and have never driven my friends. i think that my anxiety towards driving is dangerous and dont trust myself behind the wheel with other people. 

however, this cause me a lot of guilt and i think it come off a lazy/selfish even if i explain this to them. ive ended up canceling on a lot plan because of this, whether it road trip or just hanging out.

(tw is just in case)

i(13f) have been seeing a psychiatrist and psychologist since i wa 10. i've always suffered from severe social anxiety and have been referred from one psychiatrist to the next. no one wa able to give me a diagnosis, they couldn't figure out what wa wrong. my diagnosis ha changed over 13 time in the past 3 years. 

most recently i started seeing a new psychiatrist who life way outside the city, his current diagnosis is panic disorder, social anxiety disorder, clinical depression, and early sign of paranoid personality disorder. he prescribed medication but when i said i couldn't drink all but one, (the only one i'm familiar with) so he started making me appointment with a new psychologist who typically treat adult to be able to get over the fear of drinking medication.

medication often lead to panic attacks, the thought of taking medication and experiencing bad side effect or dying because the doctor prescribed too high of a dose always scare me. even more so since i got booked into the hospital for a panic attack a month ago. they gave me valium and i experienced really bad paradoxical effects. including hallucination, extreme anxiety, and a lot of emotional release. 

recently i've been experiencing lower back pain, so i saw a doctor for it today. i got diagnosed with kidney infection, which is  fatal if left untreated. they gave me a few different medication with a lot of antibiotics, and i'm too scared to drink the meds. i've only gotten 2 hour of sleep since yesterday, but i'm too scared to drink the meds. for the reason i mentioned before. and i don't wanna die or experience side effect by drinking the meds. some of the sid3 effect include hallucination and seizures. but i don't wanna die from the infection either.

and i don't know what to do anymore, i'm really scared. and it doesn't matter what anyone says, i can't bring myself to take the meds. but i don't wanna die either. and it hurt so bad. i'm honestly feeling conflicted. i just needed to vent a bit.

69,"hello dear community,

over the past year i've had tremendous help from all of you, just by reading the posts. everything that my health anxiety and gad threw at me wa something that someone here ha already gone or still going through.

now i couldn't really figure this out myself a i've been stuck in a spiral for a while now. i'm so sorry for the long post, i also want to sort of get it of my chest.

also, if anyone ha any question about their own anxiety, i'd happily answer my own experience, i've had a lot of succes batteling my own gad (health anxiety, not yet)

(perfect bmi, fairly active (muscle training, daily walks), fairly good diet (no coffee, lot of greens, some alcohol), and no family history of heart disease or high blood pressure at all on both sides)

over the last 4 month i had silent reflux with all the symptom having gone by atleast once. i went to different doctor and even had a camera stuck down my throat to see if everything is okay. turn out my lpr wa a result of too much stress in the beginning of the year and no damage or significant thing were found during the extensive investigation of my mouth-throat-stomach. after this tripple check the symptom started vanishing over the course of 3 weeks. for the past month, all i need to do is sometimes pop a gaviscon and i can eat and drink anything that i want. now i can't describe how good it feel to finally have lost those symptom a they are mentally exhousting. what i can't shed though is some sort of hypervigilance/state of constant awareness that my body is in. i have been having anxiety since i wa 14 (25 now), but after this rough year it seems like my body is too used to being anxious to let it go. my life is hectic atm but nothing that i shouldn't feel so stressed about all the time.

after 2 week of clear sky i wanted to partake in a medical experiment that try to introduce psychedelics a a form of treating certain mental illnesses. i loved this topic so i applied, had a full medical examination and everything came back perfect (bloodwork, urine, bmi and even a heart video). everything but, my blood pressure. when they measured it, it wa 138/85 ish. they said, well that's too high, we are going to measure one more time, if that one is not below 130, you can't join the trial and have to go home. i started stressing like crazy, needle to say it went to 152/90 with a hr of 100.

now this initial measurement scared me, the setting itself wa not great (super cold to the point i had shivvers), bright hospital lights, bare white room with just a desk and a bed (with a blood pressure device). and the whole experiment routine wa quite fast and 'aggresive' and i didn't really feel at ease (but not to the point it made me anxious). i remember my blood pressure being taken at my doc office a year ago and it wa 142/87 aswell (during my anxiety intense periods, health anxiety led me there in the first place).

now after that failed experiment i bought myself an omron bp meter and started somewhat compulsively measuring my blood pressure because a little voice in the back of my head is telling me i could have a heart attack at any time. every time i measure it i feel that my breathing is terrible, my hr will go up and i get measurement of like 150/90 100hr. but after i have been sitting for a while and practice a breathing excercise (when the cuff inflates i breath in deep and slow, close my eye and hold it for a few seconds, then slooowly exhale) which cause me to relax very notably. i get it around 115-127/67-85 hr 75\~ consistently when i pay attention to my breathing. once i breath normally (shallow) and allow myself to focus on the device both my heartrate and bloodpressure go up again (130-140 hr 90\~). i normally feel al calm a i do when i practice the breathing excercise during the measurement.

now i lost track of it all in my head, do i really have high blood pressure? do i get these low result because i am manipulating the device? or is my bp accurate when calming myself with slow breathing during the measurement. i'm so scared that i have this new thing that my anxiety can manifest itself in. again, so sorry for the long post but i hope that someone can talk some sense into me.

&amp;#x200b;

tldr;

blood pressure is high during doctor meetings, high when i take it myself, but gradually getting lower when i breath slowly and steadily during the measurements. how should i look at it.

first off, i recognize while my situation may seem trivial to most, at the moment for myself it is causing my world to collapse.

i recently moved after living in the same area for most of my life. i am a creature of habit and forced myself into a new situation. i wa taking this in stride and wa handling very well. i needed to visit the dentist for a check-up and opted to find a new one near work to prevent myself from missing the appointment. everything went well on the initial examination, but the doctor recommended i get a dental crown on one of my molar's since it had a root canal 7 year ago. my old dentist had said a filling wa fine for now, and i trusted my new dentist. he made it seem like i 'really needed it' telling me it would get reinfected, fracture, or have to be extracted. i wa overwhelmed with work and moving so i opted to get it.

fast forward three week later, and i had the procedure done. i had no idea what it entailed it seemed and wa horribly mortified the fact that my tooth wa ground down. did it have a root canal, yes. but it wa rather healthy otherwise. since i had this done (5 week ago) i have been a complete mess. i cannot sleep, cannot focus, barely have motivation to do anything. i am having severe panic attacks, terrible regret, and just keep reliving what happened over and over. i so desperately wa hoping i could go back and tell myself (do not do it), but i can't. it feel like a am living a nightmare. 

everything i once loved doing (running, reading, talking with my family) i disdain now. i am literally tearing myself apart because of this and it seems that whomever i talk to downplay this a not a big deal, it would have needed to be done eventually. any help on how i can move past this would be great because i feel so hopeless and trapped. i am usually able to handle stress well but this being irreversible ha completely grounded me.",anxiety

ive started my first ad journey and i wa extremely anxious to start after reading all of mostly horrible story so i thought ill share my daily side effect and my journey day by day. i hope this can help someone make a change in their life if they are being apprehensive. 

i guess a little background about me: 

ive been struggling for just over 12 month with acute gad and panic disorder, mostly focused around my health. load of physical symptoms, racing heart up to 170 bpm, daily dizziness and unable to leave the house mostly, convinced ill just drop dead a soon a i do something. ive managed to get in under control few month ago, but it returned with vengeance in october and the last 2 week were the worst ive ever went through - unable to eat, sleep, night panic attacks, day panic attacks, palpitation and stuck in fight or flight with multiple visit to a&amp;e (er). good to add all blood tests, ecg etc were fine 

ive lost hope but decided to reach out to my doctor yet again and wa prescribed propranolol for panic attack and sertraline (zoloft) for anxiety. after taking propranolol on it own, ive had a mental breakdown due to a rare side effect of acute depression and had to stop immediately. safe to say i lost all hope, and while extremely stressed and scared ive decided to take the sertraline. 

due to hour of reading horrible story and anxiety ive waited a few day and decided to start off 12.5 mg to see how bad my side effect would be 

day 1
took it at 4:00 pm. at 4:45 i felt like anxiety switch wa off. placebo i thought even thought with all physical symptom it would be unlikely but i went with it. i felt super drowsy but calm, like i want to sleep but not sleepy enough. that wa it, i felt at peace. i wa able to speak to my partner about future and i felt i had clarity for the first time in weeks. oh and my pupil were dilated. i managed to go to sleep and slept 6 hour straight. 

day 2
had some mild anxiety before next dose a it felt like previous one wa wearing off. again, around 45 minute after i felt calm and at peace. more drowsy today and also slightly dizzy. also my joint started to hurt a bit, like i caught flu. i got my appetite back and i started going to the toilet like a normal person. i ate normal meals, didnt feel sick. wa able to speak to my family over the phone after not talking for over a week. i watched a movie a well. 

day 3
has some vivid dreams, but i like dreaming so i enjoyed it. slept 5 hour but woke up not tired. appetite fully back. le anxious before the next dose, just very slightly. dizziness gone in the morning, came back a little after dose 3. surprisingly not drowsy or sleepy aa previous days. ive put some clothes on today, made my bed and went in the car and left the house to get food (didnt get out of the car). pupil still slightly dilated. im thinking about upping my dose tomorrow or the day after to 25 mg. 

ill add next day a i go, but for now im cautiously optimistic. i know it rare for this medication to work a quickly a it did for me, and maybe these are just side effects, whichever it is work for me. i only regret i didnt try to earlier a wa too scared. and even if more side effect kick in, it fine a i wa finally able to feel normal so i have hope ",anxiety

my office building just did a safety drill today. apparently if a fire alarm is pulled the building's lock are automatically unlocked -  i understand this is important for first responder to get access.

but i know that it's relatively common now in a mass shooting situation for a perpetrator to pull a fire alarm - the fact that they could do this an unlock all of the door give me so much anxiety.

to add, while you need a building badge to get to different floor on the elevator/stairs, my office us a numerical code to unlock the door, a opposed to swiping/tapping a badge. this also seems incredibly dangerous. anyone could get that code, but it would be harder for them to get a badge. and of course a every stupid office building is today, everything is glass. we have a few ""safe rooms"" for a shooting incident that requires physical keys, but even then, i don't believe the door are reinforced to withstand gunfire.

my desk is in the back and close to a stairway exit and honestly i'm just betting on running tf out if something ever happens.

i get nervous that our office design and active shooter protocol are up to snuff and while it won't ruin my day, it's certainly hovering in the back of my mind.

i needed to vent about that because it just seems so dangerous and cause at the very least, some anxiety.",anxiety

i'm on lamictal for a mood disorder and lexapro for anxiety and depression. i also have adhd with a high sensitivity to stimulant due to my anxiety so i have to take strattera instead of normal adhd drug and my therapist straight up won't provide heavier duty anxiety med like benzos. 

its so frustrating because my wife actually ha trazodone she get to take and she talk about how it just make the anxiety go away. like i wish that wa me. anxiety feel like a chronic pain, it like a crumpled ball of tinfoil in my chest that bounce around all day and make my adhd and depression even worse because i'm scrambling to put any thought together, and by the end of the day i'm exhausted. 

sorry, off-topic rant there. but lately i feel like the med aren't only not helping, but making thing worse. an hour or two after i take it my anxiety flare up, i start gritting my teeth, and i feel restless and unable to think . it didn't use to do this, or at least i don't feel like it did. but i haven't been unmedicated since 2016. i'm always taking something for my depression, my anxiety, my adhd... and i've tried so many at this point. zoloft, clonodine, propanolol, celexa, the whole suite of adhd meds, we've exhausted almost everything. i'm sick of feeling sick and crazy almost every day. it like my body just doesn't process the meds, or at least not very good.

100,"okay so for background i'm 19m and ever since around the start of the year, my fear of having an heart attack and awareness of the heart ha increased a lot, to the point where it is disrupting my life enjoyment and the thing i do. i find myself constantly checking and feeling my chest to monitor my heartbeat and heartrate, and lift up my shirt to see it beating a well. 

i've also been having pains, sharp, aches, tension and jolt in my chest, shoulder and arms. my arm also feel tight most of the time. i feel like most of this is probably more contributed to my lifestyle though. a since i've graduated high school i'm mainly sitting at my desk on my computer for hour at time sometimes 4+ without getting up. i don't eat very well either and am quite thin compared to others i know.  i'm pretty much constantly in front of a screen whether it be the drawing tablet for my university or with a controller at home. i barely take breaks. plus when i have tried to do active thing i haven't taken proper precaution and injured myself which i think wa made worse later by my inactive lifestyle at home. 

i struggle to sleep because of my heartbeat most nights, i'm always checking it in the night, i feel so much more aware of it and every little pain i get i contribute to it being a heart attack. i've been checked out by doctor earlier this year and they said everything wa fine, this wa after i had a sudden pain in my side chest and had a panic attack.

106,"
so basically my dad ha been married multiple times. there is wife #1, wife #2 (my mom), wife #3 (deceased). 

wife #3 wa sick for year terminally and we knew she wasnt going to live long. my dad wa with wife #3 for year and she passed away a year and a half ago. she ha 2 kid who are grown in their 30 who have kid of their own. 

after wife #3 passed away my dad not so long after got back together with wife #1. i even thought that it wa pretty soon but whatever it not my life. me and my sibling were never close with our step mom or step sibling at all. i felt bad for them that they lost their mom. my dad wa also heartbroken. 

my dad moved state with wife #1. i assumed my step sibling well ex step sibling now wouldnt take it well and well yeah not at all. my ex step sister went on facebook and messaged every person on my dad side of the family and wife #1s. she attacked everyone calling everyone fat ugly and all these horrible things. she made post about my dad saying stuff like he a drug addict and like kid and all this slander. she attacked wife #1s daughter and everything. im sure that if me and my sibling had facebook she would have went after us. 

now it been all this time and for a while he didnt hear from her because he had blocked her before after her freak out, until the other day my dad call me because he think im dead. yes.. dead. she texted him on a fake number saying that im dead. she texted my dad who life in another state on a fake number saying i died. wtf. when he found out i wasnt dead obviously they went at it and he blocked her again. she also found wife #1s number and texted her messed up stuff. 

now i wa so pissed off i decided to make a fake number and flipped out calling her all the horrible thing she called everyone else. fat, ugly, loser.. etc). she responded saying my sister died and then i really lost it and said i know somebody else who did. i told her she had a miserable life and to stop bothering people and whatever. she actually thought it wa my brother texting her but i said it wasnt. i blocked the number after that. 

did i take it too far? im usually such a nice person but that whole situation filled me with anger. i need any advice or input on this situation. (im mid 20 btw).

yes i block these thing and try to avoid it but i can't help but fear that i might turn out like that. or even more logically. the dumb thing i did back then will bite me back. like all the fight i had with ex friend or the dumb nsfw stuff i made when i wa in 7th grade. sometimes i can't tell if i'm a bad person or not and i really worry that i am or if people will think i am. 

i deleted most of my social and took/deleted personal information on my other social wich, i guess made me feel better. but i really do want to show the world my story and if i ever get ""canceled"" then i know people will make fun of it. although i do understand anything that's public will get hated anyways, so sometimes i consider making the story privately. i don't know. is being scared of the intirenet really valid or am i just worrying too much. amy i a bad person or evil for all those thing i did? i'm 15 but i feel like i should have known better about everything i do.",anxiety
108,"in '20/'21 i struggled really bad with anxiety. in '20 i had like 6 panic attacks, and then spent '21 very anxious about having one again.

luckily at the beginning of this year my anxiety started to fade. i still experience it mildly from time to time, but it's never a intense a it wa last year, and i've learnt how to manage it.

however this morning i woke up from a nightmare and experienced very bad anxiety that made me feel like i might have a panic attack. luckily, i wa able to calm myself down, but it wa just so awful.

i've never had a nightmare cause anxiety before, even when i had bad anxiety. the dream felt real and i felt like i wa in a scary movie. thing were happening that couldn't happen in real life and i felt terrified.

when i woke up, it didn't feel like i actually woke up, it felt like i teleported. in the dream i wa lying down on my side with my mouth open in shock, and when i opened my eye i wa in the exact same position. 

then i felt really scared in my room and i felt like i couldn't tell if i wa still dreaming or not. i wa terrified that i wa still asleep and that the dream wa real life. i felt going back to sleep would make me go back there.

last year a lot of my anxiety centred around being afraid of losing my mind/getting alzheimer's/permanently dissociating. i used to often feel like my mind wa slipping out of me and felt floaty.

well, this felt really similar to that, and it wa really weird to experience that same type of feeling again. i've come so far since then, so feeling it again almost made me feel like i time traveled back to that time.

i asked my doctor to prescribe me barbiturate for my anxiety and insomnia which he refused so there go that plan of overdosing like the blond bombshell. 
i really want to buy nitrogen or helium but i cant find a big enough cylinder and pure gas. also i dont understand the technicality of the process explained in the peaceful pill handbook. now i have landed on the idea of fentanyl overdose but i dont live in a big city and have been inside my house for 4 month straight due to social anxiety. i dont know how i m going to track down someone selling drug on the streets. i m just frustrated and so mad at myself for my inability to even die. i cant do anything it seems like. and i m too afraid of hanging or drowning, and i dont have access to a gun to shot myself. they say nicotine tea can kill you but it doesnt sound very foolproof. and then i debated if i should start taking out seed from apple and apricot but that would require a lot of seeds. 
and everytime i think oh maybe i can study x to and become y or i should reach out to my friend z i get mad at myself for even hoping for better thing or for trying to get myself out of depression, because i know it wont end the way i would imagine, but rather like another failure and disaster like the rest of my 30+ year of life. and then i tell myself to stick to my plan of dying because life is just shit and it wont get better. i know it. you cant build anything on a crippling and weak foundation.

however since moving in with him i find myself so anxious and it feel like ive gone into self sabotage mode. everything is perfect and he is just perfect but something just feel off and im so anxious that im going to lose him. like sometimes i wonder if it just because im not used to living in an environment that is not argumentative, explosive and put me in survival mode that life just feel boring?

147,"*long read*

very gratefully, i don't experience anxiety that often anymore, and if i do it's never a bad a it wa this morning.

in my dream i wa in my in bed watching tv in the dark. i wa watching scary story last night, so in the dream i wa doing the same.

the video wa showing the pov of security camera that wa on someone's front door. i can't remember exactly now but there wa a scared little boy on the screen fidgeting with the camera.

then a man came out of nowhere and started talking to the camera, giving the impression he wa a good guy and wa going to make sure the boy wa okay.

it wa a security camera that had a microphone, so whoever's house it wa wa talking to the man saying like ""okay, thanks.""

then the man said something really sketchy a he walked away but i can't remember. i noticed he suddenly had blood around his mouth.

the video wa just of an empty street for 1 second and then suddenly a little doll-like girl just panned across the screen with her throat slit and blood down her neck. she wa dangling in the air.

she wa looking at the camera saying stuff, but i can't remember what. it wa at this point i felt terrified cause it wa one of those dream that feel real. 

she went down to the ground and morphed into a clown and wa looking down, and then looked up and her eye were like looking into my soul. it felt like she wa actually acknowledging me.  

in the dream i wa so scared and thought to myself that i would watch some funny video now otherwise i wont sleep. i took the remote and my hand felt ice cold and wa shaking.

i had the cover slightly over me so couldn't see the other side of the room, but i wa scared someone wa there so i slowly peaked my head over and saw a statue of ghostface standing in the corner.

i flipped through youtube trying to find a funny video to calm me down, because i wa absolutely petrified. all the video title were in chinese. 

i then just remember lying there in shock with my mouth open, and then suddenly i woke up with my mouth open staring at the wall. but it didn't feel like i woke up, it felt like i teleported. i wa lying in the same position and everything.

my arm and leg were tingling with fear. i just lay there in shock for a while. luckily i had my boyfriend there, so i eventually built up the courage to tell him i had a nightmare. but when he asked when happened i felt too anxious to tell him.

i tried to sleep but i couldn't because the dream felt so real that i wa really anxious that i wa still in a dream. and i wa scared i would wake up in that dream again. 

it wa so bad that i needed to go on my phone to take my mind off it, and then eventually 20 minute later i wa fine enough to sleep again. 

now i'm properly awake and i'm fine, but jesus christ that wa intense. i have never experienced anything like this before. i have never woken up with full blown anxiety. 

i used to get anxiety about losing my mind/dissociating, and it felt very similar to that because the dream felt so real that i felt like i couldn't tell what wa real. and in the dream i really thought that this video wa real and that wa petrifying, and it felt like the people in the video could see me.",anxiety

now before you try to doxx me understand the story first. 

i understand the title is bad, but my cousin want to be me so bad shes willing to fake being a different sexuality

when i wa younger me and my mom would go out to see my cousin and my aunt on a regular basis, and this wa pre-covid so there were no mask or anything. my aunt wanted the perfect daughter but instead got a copycat of me. and what i mean by that is i do dance, suddenly shes in dance, im in band, shes suddenly ha an interest in band. i cut bangs, get a wolf cut and bleach part of my hair, and she cut bang and get a wolf cut but doesnt bleach a her mom wont allow it. at one point she went so far a to stealing my makeup when i wa doing it for her for dance recital nights.

she will beg her mom for anything i have, from polaroid camera to bleached hair, she want everything and would usually would get it in about a week after i showed it to her. now i bleached and dyed my hair not long ago and when we walked out of the restaurant after seeing each other i see her yelling at her mom that she want to bleach her hair like mine, and for the first time she say no. 

now back to the main point. i told a certain amount of people in the family (including her) that i wa bisexual. not even a week later she come out to everyone that shes bisexual. i have no idea what to do a she ha copied many thing before but i cant tell whats genuine or not with her now when we share things. 

now her side. 
she wanted to be like me and when i asked her if her being bisexual wa another way to be me she got so mad a i have asked her this before and she answered truthfully. 

she didnt like that i made her coming out about me even though i talked to her in private, also when she ha never talked about woman in a sensual way. she got mad and told me im a biphobic asshole who didnt deserve to live because of what i said to her.

edit: to everyone who ha told me that im just a leader and that i should just chill out, i am but it gone so far to where shes taken 300$ worth of makeup, jewelry, and other miscellaneous items. it gotten a little out of hand with her and i already struggle with mental issue too which i dont want her to know about due to the trend of copying. im also a guy who like makeup",anxiety

i end up googling ""sports bra and leggings"" or other thing - not even like ""proper"" porn, just ordinary clothes - because i like the way the model look in them; or i google to see if i can find woman sharing how they feel wearing them. i look at female cosplayers on instagram because i love seeing them dressed up a superheroines (though, weirdly, i don't like it when they're really explicit). 

i know these sort of thing aren't exactly uncommon for men, and they've been going on in my life since i wa a teen. i've shared some of this with my wife, and she just laugh and says, ""as long a you're looking and not touching"". but i don't want to become some kind of dirty old man who hang around just to ogle young women. i'm also a christian (a minister a well) and so i feel doubly guilty about it all from that point of view. i worry that if anyone ""found out"", i'd be shunned by people i care for, even though i would never act on any of this, won't buy or look at porn etc.

i got tired of living like this, so i called my doctor for an appointment with the wish of getting a psychologist referral. i got the referral. unfortunately the wait time in my country is anywhere from 3-6 months, and so he wanted to discus me getting on zoloft/sertraline before my future psychologist visits. i said i had to think about it, and i have to make up my mind before my next appointment this thursday.

despite all of the above, im really not sure if i should go on medication. especially if it not accompanied by therapy. im not sure if it would be best to start with therapy and see how that would help me. but a i said, i wont be able to see a therapist for atleast 3-6 months.

im 41, married with 2 daughters, 6 and 8. i have a good job (insurance) which pay well. it stressful a im expected to sell but i have always liked meeting people and i work in group benefit so i have never had to behave like a silky salesman.

i wa diagnosed with gad around 7-8 yr ago having developed physical symptom from worrying a lot. ive always worried but it caught up to me. i had pressure in my chest a lot, like someone wa sitting on me, and i would sigh all the time. a dr told me i wa fatiguing my chest because i wa always in a fight or flight moment. like tiny muscle movements, but all the time which end up being achey and uncomfortable.

ive tried lot of different ssri and i wa moved onto an snri because of the related physical pain.

my title of this post is im not here because it the way i feel. im lost. just a shadow of who i thought i used to be. void and lethargic all the time. hard to find any fun in thing and very cynical. in the last few year this ha impacted the way i work. there are day where i find it so hard to focus. i just sit or try and distract myself with something. there are day where i do not answer the phone. nor do i want to make a single phone call, even though i am in a role that requires face to face meeting and being a salesman. today wa a bad day. 

i drink almost every day and i don't get drunk. i'm quite tall and i've always had a good tolerance level for alcohol, but i use it to try and shift my mood. i do the same thing with marijuana daily. i know both of these cause  anxiety and will not help the situation plus will affect the drug i am taking but some day i just don't want to face my mood. 

i've definitely had thought about suicide, but having daughter is too important and i couldn't do that to them.

my doctor tell me i need to eat. and i know i need to but the fact i cannot conclusively rule out that the hive *arent* caused by an allergic reaction i cannot get myself to eat much.

230,"a little over three month ago my partner ended thing with me completely out of the blue after two year together and two month after buying a house together. we lived together for over a year before we got our house. at the beginning of this year my mental health declined after getting hyperthyroidism after covid. my antidepressant stopped working and i had to start trying others which made me very emotional. i wa cry very often but wa constantly doing work in the relationship to be a good partner despite my anxiety and depression. at first my partner wa supportive and made me feel like he would help me through this. we had plan to marry and adopt child together. later on my partner would make me feel very uncomfortable while going through this and i felt like a huge emotional burden. he would ask for space so i would stay with my parent for day at a time to try to make sure he stayed happy. he would assure me during this time that we could get through anything together and he would never leave me. i continued to worry about being a burden so i would still do all of the cooking and cleaning and tried to maintain a job a an rn while onboarding with different antidepressants. i could feel him drifting and it terrified me. i went to therapy and psych appointments, did yoga, started journaling, bible studies, anything to try to improve my condition. all the while i wa so worried that i would take too long to get better and he would run out of patience. unfortunately my fear were justified and one day while he wa out of town he called and broke up with me in the middle of me battling suicidal depression. obviously this made thing much worse. my whole life changed after a quick phone call. we sold the house and he stopped talking to me. i wa the closest ive ever been to ending my life after he broke up with me. he told me he thought i would never get better and the rest of my life would be trying one pill after another with no success. the time we have talked after he broke up with me were devastating. he would hang up on me, tell me he didnt have time for me because he wanted to go out with friends, ignore me completely. this is completely different from any way he treated me before. like a totally different person entered his body. then my 14 year old dog and best friend passed away a month later and he didnt even send a text to say he wa sorry for my loss. i even started self harming. ive been trying to pick up the piece for over three months. i landed a new job that i love, i moved into a rental house with a close friend, am spending time with friend and family but nothing helps. nothing stop the intrusive thought of him and our relationship and how perfect i felt we were together. i have panic attack daily and cry myself go sleep every night. i have lost 30 pound and i am already small. my mind is completely overtaken by him and the anxious attachment that remains. i feel like my mind is on fire all day every day and i need help. i really need help getting through this. i miss him so much and our life together. even after all that he done to me i crave our old life together and the way he made me feel. when will i stop grieving? or just feel a little okay? im terrified im stuck like this forever. i have never experienced so much pain and i am no stranger to loss but nothing compare to this",anxiety

hi guys...i decided to make a post on reddit, because here someone surely had/has the same problem a me, and i would like to have a discussion about it.
i am a 23 year old girl, who is studying for a very important exam in her life....
at the same time i find myself in a particularly delicate and unstable moment, in an almost completely desolate place because of my job.
i am supposed to study for this exam, it requires special attention, concentration and commitment...but having behind the scenes, deep insecurities, problem of other kind on an emotional level...i can't...i open the book, try to read a few lines, maybe from a subject i appreciate and i am left with nothing...as if my head is not really connected.
it's frustrating, painful and unfair to live like this....
i don't know which way to turn, i want to move at this pace, trying this direction and i can't, i feel like the whole world is collapsing in on me.
has anyone been able to overcome this problem in any way?
if so, do you have any advice?
because these discomfort that i have to be resolved will take time, a lot of time, not for nothing else i have been seeing a psychotherapist for three month already...but in the meantime?
in the meantime what do i do, do i stay put?
if anyone know anything, ha any advice for me, it's all welcome...i will appreciate every single second you spend for me, i thank you infinitely.

anyway, it suck because being the center of attention is so fun and fulfilling in the moment. then, every single time, i come home and think about how cringeworthy that wa and how i need to shut my mouth. i swear im going to stop doing it and then a hangout roll around and i cant help myself.

238,"hello there,

a few month ago i had this really bad night where i could not fall asleep because i had this constant feeling of having to go pee. now i've had this happen before but usually i sleep well the next day and it doesn't happen for months. 

sadly this time wa different and it kept on happening every single night... i would not sleep for at least 2 night in a row and the the third night i would be so exhausted that i'd sleep like a baby. first thing that came to mind is that i might have a uti and i need to see a doctor so i did. she checked my blood and urine and everything wa fine. another week of almost no sleep went by and the doctor told me to go see a urologist in the hospital. after a couple of test it wa clear that everything wa fine and i wa a healthy a i could be. 

after a few week of searching for answer on the internet i ended up with a somewhat of a diagnosis. in the end it happens to be anxiety that is causing this constant pressure on my bladder. i would say that i'm happy that it wa anxiety but i'm not. i'm having to constantly tell myself that my bladder is fine and i'm all good. at least this way the pressure go away for a while and it is manageable. now because of all the bad night of sleep i ended up creating a sleep anxiety where i get really anxious around bed time. i absolutely hate going to bed now because i never know if i'm going to sleep or not. 

my body get so hot when i get anxious and i feel my heart rate going up. when that happens i'm just completely awake and all the feeling of tiredness are gone. 

now i've learned a trick or two to at least get some of the anxiety away. i know that i need to grab a book and distract myself so the feeling can go away. i know that i need to tell myself that everything is fine and that it is not the end of the world is i can't sleep. sure they help and they make sure that i at least get a couple of hour of sleep instead of none.

the thing is i used to be such a good sleeper, i could go to bed at any time and get myself to sleep like it wa nothing. now it just one big struggle and it is really making my life difficult. i work in construction and i usually have to wake up at like 4:30am. sleeping only 2 hour a night is just exhausting combined with a hard labor job.

i would love to visit a therapist but they are all booked full for month and it's just not really going to happen anytime soon.

242,"ive been helping my grandmother by myself since i wa 18. meals, laundry, house chore and recently her mobility ha gotten worse where she cant walk anymore. i never asked for help until recently because i cant do it anymore. my aunt ha been helping me (my grandmother daughter) and though im thankful for the assistance she hasnt always been nice about it. no other family member help me like my dad (gmas son), sister who hasnt worked in years, brother. anytime they do come down to help it always an issue. 

my contract job came to end about 8 month ago and im mentally so tired. im struggling to find work on top of everything (pay more than im used to). i wa a nanny to 2 child under 3. i dropped out of college so i cant afford to just move out. please, please understand that. if i could i would. i recently enrolled in online college again and im very hesitant that ill get it done. it all in loans. i always had to put it on the back burner because of my grandmother. and i just would like more stability for myself. 

just now my aunt got agitated to help my grandmother to the bathroom because i couldnt do it due to a pre-quiz i needed to do. i usually do mornings, afternoon and evenings. thankfully it wasnt graded but i failed due to hearing her comment and loud sighs. she stated she need to go lie down because shes tired. she take the night shift which is taking my grandmother to the bathroom 2x at night. but otherwise during the day, shes constantly out of the house going place and seeing people. i feel ungrateful and like i need to do more, but i cant do anymore! i dont go out much a it is and the only time is to get groceries. i cook all meals, i walk my aunt dog, i do house chores..idk the last time i went out by myself to do something fun or to see friend yet at the same time i feel like im being ungrateful for even thinking this. i live here rent free btw bc i cant afford to live on my own.

243,"my amazing fiance and i have been together for 4.5 year and engaged for 1 year. living together for 3.5 years. we are getting married in le than 3 months! 

however, i have severe relationship anxiety. i have gad so tend to worry about literally everything. but my main worry focus on the thing that's most important to me. sometimes it's my health (thinking i have cancer), but now it's my relationship. i have worried about my relationship on and off since we've been together. this is the only relationship i've been in. i am in therapy, but my next appointment isn't until january. i am also on medication (lexapro) which ha definitely helped. 

the problem i currently have is i look into every single facial expression, emotion, word, eye movement, phrase, etc from my fiance. i do this with everyone, but it's worse with him because i love and care about him and our relationship so much. but this is driving me insane. i am not exhaggerating when i say that i analyze every single interaction we have. for example, if i walk into his home office and say ""hey"",  i analyze how he say it back to me. if i mention something about our wedding, i analyze how excited he sound (tone of voice, what he says). if we are just sitting in the couch in silence, doing our own thing on our phones, i get very worried that this mean that we are getting bored with each other. 

i am always asking myself (on every single interaction with him), doe he sound annoyed? is this a sign that he doesn't want to be with me? is he having doubts? is something about our relationship bothering him? 

it's gotten to the point where i don't even like doing thing with him because i \*know\* i will over-analyze it. often time i will close the door to my home office just to get away from him so that i don't risk over-analyzing any interaction with him. he isn't doing anything wrong. he's a human being.

anytime that he isn't 120% extremely enthusiastic, i get worried. but logically i know that it's impossible to be really excitable all the time.

this is so exhausting and miserable. i rarely bring up my thought to him because it's upsetting to think your partner think you're mad at them 24/7. occasionally, i will bring it up and he tell me ""nope nothing is wrong"". i ask him if we are ok and he say ""of course! always"". if i keep asking him, he will eventually get annoyed (understandably). he say he just want me to be a confident a him and assume everything is ok, because it is. 

i definitely have an anxious attachment style. 10 month ago he tried to break up with me due to my mental health. i had severe health anxiety at the time and wa truly ruining our life (i spent all day everyday cry about dying - this lasted over a year). i got appropriate help (medication and therapy) and haven't had health anxiety in 9 months. even with my current anxiety, i rarely every bother him with it. our life are sooooo much better. but the fact that he tried to break up with me really messed me up, especially since i've always been worried about him leaving. and then it almost happened. this ha been like my worst fear for years. 

i am just constantly looking for evidence that he's having doubt / isn't happy with me. even though i usually don't bother him with this obsession, it is tearing me apart internally.

unfortunately, my partner is the one that support u both, and is burning out pretty badly. the financial support for disabled folk where i live is an absolute joke, so i'm seriously considering heading back to work on something really easy and part time.
the kicker is that because i haven't worked in 6 years, i'm not sure where i'd get hired. i'd need something flexible, easy, and with an understanding boss, and that all seems too good to be true. i also can't just work any job, it need to be something i'm good at and actually enjoy, otherwise i'll be setting myself up for failure and more burnout.

my psychologist told me it would be a good idea to check a neurologist and it is scaring me. just the fact that my symptom are worth a visit to the neurologist is terrifying.

the symptom in question are :

- tingling in left part of my face

- various headache on one side of my head only. it range from just feeling pressure and it's painful to my temple / eye is about to pop out of my head

- slight numbness in hand / left side of my head

- repeated anxiety attacks

- vertigo (when i get up and when i do nothing)

- flashes. sometimes i have the impression that something is moving in my periphery, sometimes the light just go out for 0.01s

- difficulty with looking at things.

- neck and back pain.

- tiredness

271,"i am a 29 year old dude that suffered from anxiety for many years. 

in 2022 i decided to (finally) roll up my sleeves, put my health first, and tackle that problem.

after one year of work, i have reached a satisfying state, and i'd like to share some insight here in case someone could benefit from my experience.

# context  

over the course of my twenties, my anxiety built up.

it came with physical symptom :

\- strong headache 

\- dizziness/nausea 

\- general fatigue

i wa almost constantly experiencing one or a combination of these symptoms. amid an incessant train of negative thought and feeling of helplessness.

important to mention that no serious circumstance or external pressure ""justified"" my anxiety. i have friends, a sane family, a girlfriend, a good job and hobbies. 

anxiety made my existence quite unpleasant, not to say miserable. 

i wa heading in the direction of panic attacks, burn-out, and ultimately depression. 

something had to be done !

# approach

1. identify the problem
2. propose some potential root causes
3. based on these root causes, suggest action points
4. if the problem is still there, repeat the step above

every iteration come with a deeper understanding, and increase the odds of success. never stop analysing :) 

disclaimer : it is always more efficient to work with a psychologist, which i did.

# the problem

excessive level of stress.

i acknowledge that stress is a normal emotion, but dosage is key.

the objective is therefore to reduce that stress and bring it back to a sane level.

# the root causes

after study of the trigger of stress, and the associated (negative) thoughts, some pattern emerged. the key is to be fully honest with oneself here.

the root cause i identified are the following : 

* fear of rejection 
* fear of the stress itself

interestingly, i believe that the fear of stress came at a later stage in life, when i got aware of the harmful symptom of stress. the vicious thing is that this is not dependent on external factors, therefore i wa safe nowhere ! i wa scared of a part of myself

as a natural consequence, i developed over the year some coping mechanism :

* distraction : be relentlessly active in order not to have a single second to think. lot of sports.
* fake personality maintenance : exhausting constant work to be perceived by people in a certain way. authenticity level wa dangerously close to 0.
* negative emotion burial 
* alcohol, other things, and partying

these mechanism actually made thing worse, and generated lot of stress.

except for physical activity, which wa the only useful coping mechanism :) 

# discussion

then how to make rejection and stress le scary ?

i first tried ""facing my fears"" : for example getting purposely ""rejected"". or give many presentation in front of a large audience, a it is something that usually freak me out. 

no success unfortunately the same go for simple meditation, breathing exercises, yoga, drinking le coffee, stopping smoking or whatever technique that target the symptom only. for me, these technique worked only a long a hope lasted.

something more fundamental wa broken or missing in my brain. 

after examination of my thoughts, i found almost none regarding myself : *how do i feel ? what do i want ?* these were question i would never ask myself.

**in my conception of the world, i wa not existing.**

key piece of my software were not installed : self-awareness, self acceptance and self love.

i assumed that developing these trait would take care of my 2 fears.

indeed, theoretically, if you love and feel good with yourself, rejection is not a frightening.

the same way, with a good dose of awareness and acceptance, stress becomes just one of the brain's cocktail of emotions.

once you know yourself (especially your tastes/desires), then you can express them, reach the mythical ""being yourself"", and live a bliss. 

# action points

the objective is to develop self-awareness, self-acceptance, and ultimately self-love.

**1. develop self-awareness :**

grant yourself a couple month to know yourself.

concretely, spend a great deal of time listening and experiencing  the signal (sensations, emotions, thought and desires) that your brain and body send. name them and try to feel them without judgement. especially when you feel bad. 

""oh it seems that i am nervous : it manifest with a tense chest and a higher heart beat"". ""i feel slightly cold, with a tension in my upper calf's tendons""

personally, i sit down every morning on my couch with a coffee and nice music, and i scan my body and emotions. i actually really like it. i also listen to myself when i run, when i'm in bed...

always bring back your focus to *yourself*, a if you were the only significant being in the world. remind yourself that only what *you* feel and experience matters.

**2. self-acceptance and love :** 

\- treat yourself constantly like a mom or a coach would do : with benevolence. so concretely, identify the harmful thought (*""i'm sure they didn't like me, i wa lame""*) and reply to them with caring one (*""i felt anxious, it's ok everyone is anxious sometimes. whatever, anyway the priority now is to order mc donald's because i feel like it""*).

\- express and share how you feel. ideally with people, but also say it out loud, write it. you have to be honest in this exercise. 

example : *""oh man i'm super tired and a bit sad today, i won't stay long probably""*

\- learn to identify and annihilate any thought starting with *""i have to"" \[smile, go out, succeed, be funnier\]*. answer them with ""no i don't. i only have to do what make me feel good""

&amp;#x200b;

be aware that all this take some time, so be patient.

you'll slowly learn to enjoy your own company :)

# conclusion

managing anxiety is hard at moments, but at the same time easier than i expected.

i feel happier and more relaxed than ever ! :)

i have severe social anxiety. but i don't start shaking and vomiting when i walk into a crowded room. i will appear relatively normal. but i would almost rather die than be in that room. i'm probably only there because i absolutely have to be and i had to take meds/alcohol to physically make myself attend.

320,"i'm sorry if this is the wrong sub to ask this to, but i have a friend who is 27 currently, and is in her medical residency. i wa with her in college and have seen her deal with anxiety and low self-esteem without therapy/ medication since some time, though she is high achieving and a perfectionist. she is kind of a type a personality, with some childhood trauma of a toxic household with a narcissistic father in a toxic marriage. she ha been the person to have had to grow up quickly to deal with family at home. i have been her outlet quite a few time and though i have never minded helping her, i felt she needed therapy to help deal with negative thought process which might hamper her from reaching her fullest potential.she had denied, told me not to push her, saying she would handle it herself. she ha handled it and i'm proud of her, but i feel she need to sort out some unresolved trauma with some help. recently, just before residency began, she would say she would start therapy after starting to earn decently so she could deal with her issues. i'm really proud of how far she ha come along, and she ha done a lot of introspection  . but residency is tough, and i doubt if she'll get enough time for therapy right at this moment.

her birthday is coming up in a few days- would it be a good idea to gift her ' feeling good: the new mood therapy handbook' to get her started out on further self reflection? or are there any other book that help with self esteem and anxiety but is not very on the nose therapy?

or is it patronizing of me? i really want her to enjoy life to the fullest. there is no wrong intention behind this. forgive me if it come across that way. recently, i myself unearthed a whole host of self esteem issue and want her to deal with the root cause, the same a i am trying to.should i also tell her that i've gotten the same book to deal with it together? i might get it.",anxiety

363,"me (m20) i've been dealing with constant (and when i say constant i mean i can recall barely any situation where i have felt normal again) anxiety symptom since august of this year. i use to have daily attacks, sometimes multiple a day. i've gotten better with the attack but my symptom are always there. anyways i'd say like 3 month ago i went to my family doctor and got citaloptam and it did jack, returning back to the doctor my mom who is a nurse demanded they give me something quick acting and reluctantly they gave me .25 xanax pills. 30 count no refills. they helped ton but the problem wa i had to take 2-3 of them to help me feel normal but ofc at the rate i wa taking them they were gone in like 2 weeks. i had a follow up appointment a month after that. they shamed me for going thru it that fast and put me on buspirone. it helped relieve my symptom but i could not deal with the god awful brain zaps. we finally managed to beg for another bottle of xanax but once again it wa a .25 30ct. that would only last me hypothetically 10 days. anyway fast-forward now and i have been clutching on to this bottle trying to not ""waste"" pill even tho i'm laying in bed not able to breath and my arm feel like it's on fire. my question is, is there any way i could find a doctor/specialist who would feel fine with giving me what i need and/or understand what i'm going through and actually help my situation. sorry this post wa so long i just wanna include much detail on my experience for others. comment on y'all's experience would be greatly appreciated 

tl;dr: my family doctor think i'm only visiting for xanax and doesn't believe i need them even tho they are the only thing that helps. i need suggestion on what i can do.",anxiety

366,"so something thats bothered me for quite a bit is my forgetfulness, my inability to keep a timeline and being mid sentence i could be looking you dead in the eye having a whole story to tell and out of nowhere forget what im saying. a friend mentioned today that she noticed my spaciness during conversation and she ha to remind me sometimes what i wa just saying. ive also gotten frustrated because i forget what im saying and it disappointing. in these time i notice how high my anxiety is, after she said this to me i wa trying to tell a story to her but my anxiety kept winning my thought and all i could think about wa how she mentioned my spaciness, giving me anxiety that she noticed it a well. i am an active weed smoker, it used to very heavy. every night, chain smoking since i wa 15 and im now 25. now maybe a few time a week and only one hit. i dont drink. when i wa 17-18 i took a lot of xanax and adderall. i never have had an addictive personality and quit both of them cold turkey, both unprescribed. basically, i wonder if the xanax had anything to do with it or if my anxiety is getting the best of me in the moment? i notice it happens a lot more once i begin to get tired a well. feel free to ask questions, id really just like an idea a to why i do this, it driving me crazy!",anxiety
367,"not too long ago, maybe a month or so, i wa ready to end it all. i hit the lowest point of my life and wa thinking daily about way to end it. after year of bullying, loneliness and self hatred i wa ready to give up, ready to throw in the towel and be done with it all. i dont know what it was. maybe a half heartedly posted motivational tiktok, maybe a quote from a good show or maybe it wa nothing but me. but i had enough of being the way i was. why should everyone else get to be happy while i want to die. i put together the most beginner workout routine ive ever seen and got to work. it wasnt hard to start with, against my better judgement i had never committed to working out because it seemed like too much effort. but this time wa different, i didnt overshoot on my capability and i stuck with it for weeks. on maybe my 12th session i looked in the mirror and noticed my stomach felt harder, it looked like it had some muscle on it. when i say i wa proud of myself for the first time ever i mean it. i had done it. i wa getting better. i wasnt close to being done but i wa doing well enough to be proud of the progress i had made. a few week later and i had finally after 17 year made a daily routine. i woke up feeling refreshed for the first time in years. i woke up happy for once. i ate breakfast because i woke up early enough for it. i started working on my skin. i think this wa when it clicked for me. i hadnt just gotten better in a few ways, i had overcome suicide. there a quote thats stuck with me since i wa at my lowest. it didnt click for me until month later but it remains with me to this day. it a line from a song by mf doom and although i cant remember the exact song if you search up the lyric you can probably find it. it go a follows, some people wish to die, they need to hold their horses, there bigger fish to fry. it such a simple line but for some reason it just stuck with me. it such an out of character line from doom since he play the role of the villain in all his works. i think that wa what made it special for me. now at the present im cry typing this up. seeing a visual on the progress ive made is amazing. this may come off narcissistic or arrogant but i think this whole recovery journey ha made me into a more mature and better person. im still the same boneheaded fucking moron at heart but i truly believe ive become kinder, that ive matured in my mindset, that ive realised my worth. there have been point where ive read something online of which ill give a few examples. i saw a comment on a video of someone manga collection saying about how theyve finally grown up and realised there more to life then comics. i truly believe before this great change in myself i would have insulted him but, i dont know why but i decided to just leave my thought without negativity. i just replied that if they buy the comic with their money and thats what they enjoy then i truly believe no harm no foul, that people can like what they want. the other example ill provide is today i saw a negative review for my favourite book. it wa a three paragraph one star review saying about how poorly written it was. i found myself judging this person at first but i thought to myself, well why am i judging them. at the end of the day the book is my favourite in my opinion and if this person doesnt like it then thats their own opinion theyre entitled to. it may sound like an obvious observation but i feel like my whole life ha been surrounded with such negativity that it took over my mindset and now with my own personal development ive overcome that. now id like to get personal for a moment. there two thing id like to mention here. my dad and my friend. first off my dad, he hasnt really been too present in my life and being honest my mum very harshly villainised him for doing drug or for leaving us. for year i just assumed the worst and hated him. but a of late ive visited him for week at a time. i realised that although yes he left me he ha his own reason and i shouldnt judge him without the context. especially when it came to him doing weed. i always thought it wa disgusting and that he wa a deadbeat for doing it but a i get older and ive revelled in drinking (not heavily just at parties) i realised i have no right to judge him for it. it his body and therefore his choice. me personally id never do it mostly out of fear of losing money or getting hooked but nonetheless he ha every right to it and he doesnt deserve to be thought of a a villain for it. now for my friend, charlie youre either reading this after ive sent you it during a paranoia breakdown or youll never see this. it doesnt matter in the end. when you called me up after school complaining of lola i desperately wished youd stop, because although we both hated her it hurt me consoling you while dealing with so much myself. when you broke down to me a few night ago i realised im finally ready to help you. i can provide you with the best advice i have but you have to put it into effect. i think the best way i can get this across is with lola. i have removed her from my train of thought. shes no longer present in my mind and ive largely stopped hating her and started hating what she did to me. i think this is the step you need to take. you feel empty, not sad. but you wont feel fulfilled if you fuel yourself with negativity. so sending a post by lola and commenting on it in a spiteful manner? you need to stop for your well-being. hate is a vicious cycle thats difficult to escape from. for anyone else reading this far in i hope that you can learn something from this. because while im not  successful yet, ive come far and im gonna get there one day. i know that if i can do it you sure a fuck can. my traumas, my insecurities. theyll never be a bad a another person you know. but they were bad enough for me to wish for death and my heart wa strong enough for me to overcome the lowest point of my life. it only up from here

370,"18m 

as for a lot of u experiencing health anxiety and anxiety in general, a lack of appetite and poor nutrition is all too common. ive been dealing with severe anxiety over my heart (chest pain, tachycardia, palpitations, hyper-awareness) that ha left me pretty much bedridden and debilitated. ive had so much testing done, everything point to my heart being healthy, just frequently tachycardic especially when standing/walking (hence the bedridden.) 

and for the past few months, ive had such trouble eating more than pretty much one meal a day, and certainly they werent always nutritious. 

earlier this month, i had went to the er over persistent chest pain/numbness in which they ran the usual tests. however, in the blood test it showed i wa a little low in potassium (3.4) and i panicked upon looking into the world of electrolyte deficiencies, and general daily nutrition adequacies. 

i immediately began feeling all of the symptom associated with low potassium/hypokalemia, the muscle twitching/spasming, weakness, fatigue, etc. and saw that apparently an adequate intake is between 3,500-4,700 mg a day. i talked with my pcp and they said not to worry and that mild decrease cannot cause symptoms. i explained to her that i havent been eating enough throughout these month of debilitating anxiety, and she said it rare to develop hypokalemia from diet alone because there a little bit of potassium in a lot of things. yeah, a little, a in usually way under 100mg, or even if it close to 100, there a lot more sodium. and for high potassium foods, you would still need to eat several of each item or have to eat the same high-potassium food every day to even be close to 2000mg a day (which seems a lot more realistic and feasible to me.) 

how is that possible? i have been trying to uptake potassium in my diet throughout the day now along with just trying to eat more, specifically focusing on high potassium foods, and it been difficult to even get over 2000mg. 

i hate being aware and now fearful of not getting enough potassium, and now other nutrient &amp; electrolyte otherwise im going to die. doe anyone else look back into their diet and see if theyre getting practically 5000mgs worth each day? it feel impossible and scary and looking back on my diet when i wa not a debilitatably anxious and eating throughout the day i wa still certainly not getting enough, not even trying. and not to mention the amount of sodium and sugar there is in everything that overpowers potassium anyways. 

is 5000mg really what the average joe is eating a day to not be hypokalemic? i wish i never became aware of this and now having to worry about fucking food.",anxiety

oh my god, i am glad i wa able to experience that concert. i managed to record most of it with my phone screen record function. it wa beautiful, moving, and visually stunning. i cried at one point because of the way it made me feel, in the best way.

the music. her voice. there something about them thats soothing. calming.

im a metal head at heart. i love to sing and scream. it a great way to vent. however, sometimes the music can be a little too aggressive or the lyrical content of a particular song cut a little too deep. but the aurora concert (and accompanying album) ha an air of tranquility to it.

it's been 5 year since.

anyway, i watched the midnight club this october, the indian boy had a gbm and it impressed me, i googled gbm all the time and got myself down a rabbit hole

then i did a ritual and said that if i ever hear the word brain tumor in any movie again, i did a ridiculous ritual (i'm a totem maker and i believe it a lot) bum the next series is squid game and old man

google symptoms, rituals, the thought that my subconscious made me suffer from this disease, sleep problems, etc. the rest is classic

the problem is that i'm just afraid of the tumor called gbm

i am not afraid of stage 4 cancer, stroke, heart attack
i can't make sense of this event, what are your recommendations, i don't want to use drugs, i'm doing emdr and psychotherapy 

my obsession is in such a position that if the doctor tell me i am gbm, i will be at peace because i say i have nothing to suspect anymore.",anxiety

430,"i have pretty ridiculous adhd. i wa in trouble a lot a a kid for being impulsive, stealing, being disrespectful to authority figures, needing to be the center of attention, talking constantly, and lying frequently. 

i'm 39 and medicated now, so some of it ha changed, but i can't escape racing thought and constantly looking for shit to be worried about. i can't seem to stop churning through everything i've ever said or done. i feel like my adhd brain want me to feel guilty and anxious. i have better control over impulsive actions, but i regularly blurt thing out that i immediately regret saying, so my brain ha plenty of footage to torture me with. 

i have also been diagnosed with depression and generalized anxiety. i dwell, stress, and worry. it feel like shit. i feel like these racing thought are sending me into another depression spiral where eventually i stop leaving my bed and answering my phone... and showering... and being a functioning human. i want to sleep all the time. when i'm asleep, i'm not guilt tripping myself or having hypothetical confrontation in my head with people from work or people i'm angry at. lot of negativity. it's almost constant and usually result in me eventually becoming angry and snapping at people i love, or telling people to leave me alone. it's overwhelming. just being touched or hugged is overwhelming and make me feel physically uncomfortable.  like mild claustrophobia? constricted. i'm very impatient and irritable. i snap at people too easily. i am isolating myself.

i find myself doing multiple task at the same time to constantly keep my brain busy. before this post, i wa playing fall guy and watching tiktok in between rounds. rapid fire distraction in between playing a game where focus is necessary. i also try to shut my brain down with mild substances. i keep using bandaids.

432,"i have gad, panic disorder and bipolar ii disorder. i have been having the weirdest symptoms. 

three week ago, i got double vision right when i woke up. i ended up barely being able to stand and then vomiting. pretty much lasted all day and at the end it felt better.

i have been having symptom so concerning i went to the er. ruled out heart problem after x-ray, ekg, blood work all came back normal.they occurred earlier this year and here and there. lately they have been a bit worse. 

the symptom usually are feeling faint, heart palpitations, nausea, pressure headache, shortness of breath, double vision, chest tightness on left side, neck stiffness on left side, jaw seems a little numb on left side. i feel like the double vision seems hard to explain though. 

i don't feel anxious. my heart rate can get kind of high but it always stabilizes. i do breathing exercise and relax. nothing really trigger it and it come and go in waves. it can be really bad at one point and i can't stand, and another i feel a bit better. 

i tried to take a bath but it made me feel faint and nauseous. 

my heart rate wa kind of high so i did some breathing and it went down. the chest pain doesn't go away. i still felt faint. still have a pressure headache. i took atenolol and it helped with the vision and nausea. maybe it is anxiety?

it come seemingly out of nowhere. i don't know why. my chest doesn't stop hurting. sometimes it's just a day. sometimes a week. on and off. i know sometimes anxiety doesn't have to have a trigger but it's so confusing.

the double vision and nausea right when i woke up three week ago is what make me think it may not be. i start to think it could be something serious and that make it much worse. either way, anxiety could be making some kind of condition worse or me worrying only increase my anxiety. 

i don't know if this is anxiety. i know gad and panic disorder can definitely be chemical imbalances. i already have bipolar disorder so it would make sense. i'm not asking for medical diagnosis because i already know i have it lol. just wanted to know if  anybody ha had a similar experience.",anxiety
433,"i fear im the worst version of myself that i ever have been. im clinically depressed and have been since i wa young. after highschool i received an official ical diagnosis for depression only and have been on/off various antidepressants. ive never been particularly anxious a my depression wa more of the apathetic kind with the occasional low/sad day.

well, ive had a lapse in my insurance and so ive long since run out of my previous medication. im trying to get another one but that will take some time. however i feel like im slipping. particularly at work im anxious everyday, there wa time i couldnt keep food down because my stomach wa so unsettled from it. i feel like an imposter and like i dont belong, like everyone hate me. i know it not true and i know it not real but i cant make it stop. i didnt feel like my previous medication wa working, and while i still feel that way it becoming soberingly clear to me now that the med were in fact keeping me from unravelingunraveling that i now cant stop. my depression is clinical, and while there are various environmental and probably genetic factor i can point totheres no concrete cause of it. so, everyday i feel worse and worse but dont have the word or explanation to explain why and i feel that everyone around me think im trying to make excuse for my shortcomings. in the last few day especially i feel terrified, like there something squirming inside of my chest and im the only one that know it there. i dont feel like i have anyone to talk to, because nothing ever change and i feel like i technically have nothing to vent about. i dont nt want to be someone that only talk about their same problem over and over again, a ive had that done to me. plus, there nothing specific that make me feel this way so there nothing to talk about that will make me feel better.

ive never experienced this type of anxiety before other than to convince myself it not real. i dont know how to live with it and i dont know how to make it stop. im not even sure if this is the right place to talk about this or if anyone will click on my post. i often just try to distract myself with the same music, youtube, content or video game to keep my mind elsewherebut this ha been critical to my work ethic. i have a therapist but lately my chest ha been full 24/7, and it not enough for a single 1 hour session. self care doesnt work for me because im unable to indulge in thing emotionally, and lately ive been to fearful about work to be able to relax without feeling guilty. i dont know what to do or to make the squirming stop, and my thought have started to become more daring. what do i do? how do i stop it?",anxiety
434,which one is better? im finding that the l theanine is not working/ the chewable im taking made me feel worse because of the additive (citric acid/sugar making me feel sick). however im hesitant of green tea because of the caffeine. caffeine used to not effect me much but nowadays it can induce anxiety if it too much.,anxiety

i wonder where a case for medication end and begin with an anxiety sufferer. i've never tried medication but i'm looking into it.

with my depression, i find that medication isn't required for myself but i need a lot of self care, use techniques, keep up good habits, etc.

with my anxiety, it feel so much more ""built in"". my hand constantly tremble. i'm awaiting an autism diagnosis which may shed some light on things.

437,"i know that this is weird to say, especially when there are so  many negative side effects, but i feel like my anxiety journey and the disease itself ha made me a better person. i think that it ha made me more sympathetic and empathetic a a person. i can relate to people much easier than i can before i really started experiencing the worst of my symptoms. it ha also really reinforced to me that people are going through thing that you do not see and you just need to be kind to them. it reminds me of a quote i read a while ago under the present brutal and primitive condition on this planet, every person you meet should be regarded a one of the walking wounded. we have never seen a man or woman not slightly deranged by either anxiety or grief. we have never seen a totally sane human being.    

i know that this journey ha been hell for the past five years, but it ha also made me realize that i've made mistake and that i have not been perfect. i think of all of the people that i treated like a dick because i wa feeling really anxious and i needed to get away. it make me realize i need to work on myself to just keep being better and to improve myself a a person. the journey sucked, but in the end it wa a really big blessing for me. it made me see who wa in my corner, and it made me realize that i am a stronger person than i think that i am.

now im dealing with something i feel like i can prove and i dont know how to deal with it. when i am physically around people their phone is never out of their hand. any time it make a noise or light up they immediately stop everything and respond to it. i witness this every time im around them. i text them and i either get no response at all or a text a few day later with sorry im just now seeing this. if i bring up them not replying to something. i didnt see it.

so instead of working myself up into an anxiety induced state of depression i just stopped texting anyone a month ago and not one person ha noticed or even tried to text me. im around them a lot and not a word about any of it.

first time posting here (23m), but i'm hoping i'm not alone in this very disconcerting symptom of health and general anxiety. since september, i've managed to drop around 25 pound of weight - i look great but feel awful. there have been week that i've lost 7-8 pound come friday. and yes, i have spoken with my doctor, and she blame it all on my through-the-roof anxiety... said that something like cancer or al would be extremely unlikely given my age and health.

i (18f) have just told my mother i can't go to work a i got anxiety and thinking about talking to co-workers+customers ha made me physically feel like throwing up. i think the phrase my stomach in a knot would work? not sure... i feel extremely upset a in my head i feel a though my mother's disappointed. um i feel ashamed to say this but i stopped going to school and stayed in my room, which unfortunately made me not graduate. my anxiety really spiked after school wa going back to normal from the pandemic, i couldn't keep up at all. i kept to myself and barely spoke with friend except the occasional hey and smiled when it felt like i wa alone and i shouldn't be there. i did have a therapist during the pandemic and towards the end of it a she gave me the option of continuing on with a different therapist or stopping and picking up later in the year a she didn't have enough student to help at my school (really only me). i chose continuing later on a she mentioned something about traveling to my school when i'm her only student wouldn't work. i wa in group therapy btw, helped my anxiety more. anyways yeah she never talked to me again. mentally i wasn't well, a bit better now but it's not who i used to be. back to the job thing, it's a fast food chain, i worked during the pandemic in a smaller store that had le foot traffic and wa le stressful. i got moved to a closer one that unfortunately for me wa jam packed more often then not with huge order or lot of customers. it didn't help that when i went in i felt like i wasn't moving fast enough or i didn't speak well and messed up my word and when i blew up cause some customer give me a panic attack. i don't feel like i should be working in this industry anymore a my social anxiety and nerve have gotten out of hand. but... i can't get out cause my mother introduced me to the job and oversees me plus it's the only thing i can do a i pretty much can't do stuff alone or stay at home. i can't make appointment or call people when i urgently need to, like i need to get an eye exam to get my driver's license but i get anxiety thinking about it and put it off. i'm scared like super scared, i know people say you still have time, your young just relax... but i can't, i worry constantly if i'm not distracting myself by reading, i'm drowning in anxiety about what to do and getting depressed on how much i drain my family.",anxiety
468,"i mean this with no harm or intent to bash, but a a male with anxiety i feel most of the time when we vent to someone there never really a purpose for it. from personal experience coming from a loving family and group of friends, it like you just get potential outcome when venting and not someone who really there to listen and just hear you out. you know like the just go to therapy  or i cant help you if you wont listen to my advice and seek help but they dont realize your looking at them for help with just a simple convo in mind. sometimes i know myself i just want to talk to a close family member or friend and just be able to hear word of wisdom from them, not to sound selfish but sometimes word of encouragement from a family member can change your whole mood and uplift, not just go to therapy . i think therapy is the final step but being able to open up with close one is the crawling phase to a clearer mind.

tldr- told my friend i have feeling for them, they said no. we stay friend and 2 week later they're telling me they like someone.

when i told them i wa upset because my feeling towards them made me feel like a bad friend and they did tell me that me having feeling for them made them feel lied too and our friendship wa nothing more than me trying to get with them. this wa never the case, they're my friend first and foremost and i just so happen to catch feelings, i couldn't help it. we talk it out and we're still friend and talk all the time. 

waking up to a message from them telling me they have a crush on someone hit me with a few feelings. 1. i'm happy for them like genuinely, my friend is an amazing person and deserves someone in their life.
2. it feel like salt in the wound. i'm still a little upset about how the situation went down a few week ago and now they've come along to tell me this and it just feel like they're kicking me when i'm down and it doe hurt. but i know my friend, i know they told me this because they're happy and excited and i'm honoured that few feel like they can tell me news like this , they didn't do it to hurt me or again kick me when i'm down.

474,"hi everyone,

i (22m, uk) have suffered with anxiety since i wa about 10 year old and i have an anxious attachment style towards relationships. both of my parent abandoned me (dad left when i wa 3 and my mum left when i wa 18) and i now live with my grandmother. 

i met my ex (20f) in 2020. we dated through the multiple lockdown and during this time my anxiety got worse. when we had opportunity to see each other i flaked a couple of time because i got used to being indoors and driving an hour and a half to see her seemed to make me anxious even though it didnt before. she couldnt drive to me a she didnt have a car until june 2021. when lockdown finally ended, we met up in the following august. i had a massive panic attack which led to me being physically sick and i wasnt able to distinguish the panic attack from the environment i wa in, so i broke up with her while in panic mode. we stayed friend since then.

in february 2022, i told her that i still loved her and that i wanted her back. i knew that i couldnt let my anxiety get in the way. we met in a neutral location and had an amazing time. but for some reason, the anxiety wa still there. she had never been to my hometown and i wanted to show her my life and get her to meet my family. but she said she wasnt comfortable with that yet. the following week, my panic attack came back and i had no idea why a i knew i had what i wanted. so i said that i wanted time to improve myself and put the right support in place so that i could give her my 100% and fully show her my best.

in the 9 month since then, weve stayed in contact every day and ive kept quiet about my feelings. ive tried 2 different type of therapy and i feel like ive gotten a better understanding of my trigger and why my anxiety wa so bad and led to self-sabotaging behaviours. i also feel le anxious about thing that used to really hinder me (social event and spending money) and made plan to try new thing to really make sure the change in my mindset stick.

so a month ago i told her that i still had feeling for her and wa ready to fully commit to a relationship etc. i really do love her and want to grow and start a life with her. she even made me reevaluate my view on having children, something that i wa dead against because of my own family experiences. she told me that her feeling werent a strong and that she just wanted to be friend because she had attempted to move on with 2 other guy but they didnt work out. i asked if we could meet up a i wa on a work business trip in her hometown at the time but she said that it would be awkward because she would feel like i wa trying to show her that i had changed with the agenda of getting back together.

what i dont understand is how she feel about things. i feel like shes given me mixed signals. she said that she still loved me but not enough to try thing again. i dont blame her for that, but she also said thing like she cant predict the future that we wont get back together again and i still like you a a person and i still think youre attractive but you hurt me. i dont quite get why she still talk to me and call with me every day if those feeling arent there anymore. and when i told her i had changed, she said that she couldnt see that i had changed - but she wont give me the opportunity to show her, so im in a difficult position. she did however say that we could meet when thing have settled down.

she know that i do therapy and my situation with my parents. im really trying to better myself because ive never felt this way towards someone before and i know that i can be better now that i have my anxiety under control. is there anything i can do to make thing right with her? surely maintaining a close relationship a friend is a step in the right direction, or is she just using me a a backup option / comfort blanket? is there any chance that i could be with her again in the future?

before tht i want to explain bout this app. it's actually mainly to make friend but most of people trying to find partner. i'm introverted tht have no closed frd so yea... i'm very lonely. im trying to get along with people, trying to make frds but it's fail, most of people want nude, sa, if i talk to someone with same gender i get treated like shit assuming i'm lesbian because i'm being nice. i'm not bothered by it, just make me more aware of tht kind of people. 

but i still continueing use tht app because of loneliness at the same time i like the pleasure of suffering, at least i can forget bout other problem for a while. i'm not looking for lover i just want someone to talk, no need to keep in touch with me for a months, just wanna have a meaningful conversation it doesn't need to be deep conversation thts all, u can go after tht. oh..bout tht guy

he's message me first , he rudely judging my post, i honestly don't mind, i like to see other pov of wht other people think, at tht time he just a stranger from internet, why would i cared deeply wht he think bout me? 

i wa so calm when chatting with him even tho he trying to piss me off he never trying to sexualise or anything . after tht i always talk to him we having a good time, longer i get to know him, he actually a really nice person i like the honestly and confident he had ,we've been known each other for like 4 months. i noticed something... maybe he like me? then i said ""nahh that would never happen"". because i never told my name, he also don't know how i look like.. how is that possible? 

 i get the mindset of people just looking for look before have interest to know someone there's, nothing wrong with tht but i don't want to get involved(i can't accept the fact people can love someone just because of looks) 

he make a confession tht he had feeling for me, i rejected him once even tho i like him. he actually offer a contract couple bcuz he know i'm not into sr relationship. 

then after a month i notice that like him too. so we started dating fr, i usually don't pay attention bout look but.. he's extremely good looking, i just realised bout it after the the first time video call with him. i wa soo shy i can't even look at he's eyes. he also having a hard time making eye contact with me. whts more thts on my birthday. he really really want to talk to me face to face . he also  flirthing and attentive, it make me flustered.

after tht day which is today, i get insecure, i'm not ugly just average looking. my mom always said men just like pretty women, they no such thing a attract to personality or other than looks. she trying hard to make me believe that. she said ""so u must choose someone with average looking to make it le possibility he would cheat"" .

i don't know if i should believe her or not. i don't know if i can be with him.i not sure if he would love me for long term. he can find someone much more prettier than me. he said he like me because of my personality but i noticed he also can like someone because of looks. there's no evidence wht i think is wrong. 

the problem is i feel like i wanna break up, because of this anxious feeling tht he might left me because of my look , personally i do think i'm cute, but not the prettiest. like i said he good looking 
there's a lot of girl trying to flirted with him, he always got chance to cheat on me.

 i always keep in mind no matter how jealous i wa i won't tell him bcuz, if he like someone else there's nothing i can do. maybe he like me temporarily cuz i got something interesting to talk, attractive in his eye for a while because time can change tht. other reason maybe i like him because i'm want someone to talk. i'm confused with my own feelings. 

he's not prefect, i'm not prefect too but we like spending time together. i wish i can be his pet. being a good listener ,always by his side, want nothing more,i mind if he like someone else, but if tht the only way i can be with him i would allow it, a long a i can be with him 

i remember one thing... he said he love cat more than human, so i asked "" then why u date human?"". because u remind me of cats. ""u always hessing here and there when u get mad lol ""

in the email i said that i wa resigning from my current position but i didn't mention the internal transfer application that i filled out while i wa there on wednesday.

so i think it would be embarrassing to ask if the second position is still available, but anyways is there a chance it is? i've been able to actually think about it while i haven't been there and i do enjoy working for them, it's just anxiety being in the way and the second position wa still intriguing regardless... :/",anxiety

485,"hi. i need some advice. i have gad and health anxiety, i've been in therapy for year (talk therapy) but my health anxiety and agoraphobia got much worse after the pandemic.

a week ago, i had a big panic attack during a heatwave, after eating something too heavy that made me feel bad. it took me almost 2 hour to calm down. i wa very overheated and scared. this set off a week of near constant anxiety, always feeling off and on edge, on the verge of a panic attack and afraid of it. i started having little episode at night that woke me from sleep. i could handle them but it took a while to go back to sleep.

after a week of this, i had a really really big panic attack on friday after a nap. i hadn't had one this intense in a long while. it completely paralyzed me, i felt like i would drop dead if i moved, my heart wa pounding and i wa very weak and shaky. i had to use the bathroom like 10 minute into it and wa so scared i just believed i would pas out sitting on the toilet. this left me so shaken i just couldn't fully calm down. it's not my first intense panic attack but i always manage to calm down, and for this, wave of panic kept coming hour later. i felt like i wa something that had to be terribly wrong with my body, or that i would just explode and go insane.

i talked to a family doctor (she is an alternative doc) and some stuff she gave me helped. i wa still scared to sleep but when i managed to, i slept fine.

i spent yesterday okay, some anxiety in the morning but it subsided after my beta blocker and food (i am medicated for pvcs, a benign arrhythmia). today, i woke up at 7am in a panic again. managed to calm down and sleep some more, and woke up again a few hour later and just started feeling anxious and had another bad panic attack. very shaky, very scared of my body sensations, afraid something is terribly wrong with me, impossible to move. i cried in the middle of it out of frustration, again it took me a really long while to calm down and i'm still a bit affected now.

i just don't know what to do. i am afraid of going to sleep because i fear i will wake up like this. afraid of eating because i fear it will set off an attack (don't worry, i'm still forcing myself to eat), absolutely terrified of leaving my house to even go to the er or something. i don't know what to do and am truly desperate. doe anyone have any advice? a family member keep offering me some clonazepam but i'm wary of taking benzos without medical guidance.

recently one of my cousin wa in hospital w seizure and kidney failure for something a simple a an electrolyte imbalance. i think this just left me feeling really scared and i just don't trust my body during this attacks. i got an annual checkup and cardiac health checkup 2-3 month ago and everything wa alright but i just truly can't seem to trust my body and believe there ha to be something wrong because these attack just feel so damn physical. i just don't know how i'll manage to work tomorrow like this. if anyone ha tip or advice i would appreciate it greatly, i am somewhat desperate. do i call an emergency doctor? do i contact my psych today? i am just so scared of these attack and what i feel during them.

a few day ago, her and the coo spoke to me about organizing my time better and contributing to more work related ideas, but i can't even begin thinking of idea because i'm afraid i'm going to say something stupid.


i also lost a lot of friend in my life because i don't express my emotion when i'm upset and i do shitty thing to them.


i don't even know if any of this make sense, but i'm just so stressed out and i always feel like i'm on the verge of tear and that something bad is going to happen. and when i get these thoughts, i tell myself i don't have it a bad a others because i don't have daily panic attacks. hence, i don't deserve to feel this shitty.

hi, for most of my life i have suffered from severe social anxiety. growing up, i wa moved around a lot a a child, never really being able to settle down and make friend and socialise, between 2006 and 2011 we moved around nine time and i went to three different schools. at one stage we moved to malta, we were there for around a year and i wa never put into school there which meant i missed out on a whole year of making friends, socialising and just learning new things.

because of all this it effected me in later life, i never learnt how to socialise and just talk to people and a a result, have basically locked myself away from the world since leaving school in 2011, my only friend being my dad who sadly passed away in january. i wa also diagnosed with autism back in 2016, my dad wa huge in my life and wa always there for me but his passing ha taught me two things, life is often unfair but i shouldnt waste it either. 

basically, i left school in 2011 unprepared for life, ive honestly done nothing since leaving school in 2011, no job, no friends, nothing. my social anxiety just slowly got worse over the year and i am extremely disappointed in myself for letting this happen.

but, i want to try and change this. i want to travel, i wa left a bit of money by my dad and would like to use to hopefully improve my life, even if a tiny bit, life is short and i just want to do something out of my comfort zone but cant really bring myself to do it. i dont know where i would be going, i dont plan on staying at a hostel or trying to talk to people but just going to another country alone is something i am eager to do, i am 27 year old now and just want to do it but need some support from others that have traveled alone before. thank you if you read all of this.",anxiety
499,"hello there folks.  


bit of an embarassing situation for me. to give a bit of a resume of my situation.  
i've been suffering from anxiety for a long time. it used to be almost impossible to live with, but with the help of friend and doctors, i've managed to get it under control. it came with depression, constant nightmares, etc...  


for about... a year or two now, i've been doing alot better. nightmare are rare and i'm aware of them and my social anxiety is getting better.  


yesterday, my day wa just fine. i woke up a bit later than expected (lack of sleep, so i think i needed it), day went alright. chatted with a few friend and my shift at work went really good. so i got home, went to bed and managed to sleep for a bit, woke up, a usual, and decided to go back to sleep for a couple extra hours.  


then i had one of my worst nightmare ever... i don't really want to talk about it but it my third worst nightmare, on a very close podium with the other 2. it wa very, very bad and i couldn't pull away from it, i wa simply stuck in.  


it went so wrong that i actually wet myself, and that's what finally made me able to wake up. it is the first time that i actually wet myself in a nightmare, or even a dream for that matter. and it wasn't wasn't really related to having to pee in the ""'dream"" or so, it wa just pure horror...  


anybody had that before? i mean-.. i'm not one to easily wet myself. i have a dangerous job and i'm used to stressful situations, missed death by inch a few times, and it never happenned to me before...  


i'm really confused and also scared that it might happen again... just wanted to know if any of you ever experienced that? i thought i wa doing better and i actually might not, and i'm nervous about it because i wa actually managing to take care of myself and work on thing i've waited year for me to be able to do and accomplish a childhood dream...",anxiety

502,"on mobile, apologies. 
for added context: im adhd and autistic. and i struggle with rejection sensitivity (rsd).
i am in my early 20 and have zero friends. and im not being dramatic. like there no one. sure, i have a handful of aquantinces, but im definitely the afterthought for everyone. im never invited anywhere, and if i am, they usually forget me. that happened recently and i just went home without saying anything.
the last real friend i had wa when i wa 16. and i feel like it getting harder with every passing year to make a friend. my anxiety get worse and worse. 
there are time where i feel like im making progress. for example, the situation above. i wa invited for dinner and drink after work (stadium concessions). we got off at the same time. they bolted and i lost them in the crowd. i wa too embarrassed and anxious to reach out so i just walked home. they never brought it up or reached out. 
there are some coworkers i get along with. i have like a top 5 that i really enjoy working the same shift with. we have great conversations, work well together etc. however, all 5 of them hang out outside of work all the time. they are good friends. we all met at the same time so it not like there's history. 
and honestly i can't even blame them for not liking me. i am a very difficult person to like, much le love. i am very awkward. i dont get social cue all that well. my auditory processing is crap, so group convos are very difficult for me. i stammer when i'm nervous (which is always).i'm very quiet. growing up, i wa called annoying my whole life for talking so much so now i just...don't. and in group setting whenever i do happen to participate, i always get runover by someone else. so i don't do it.
i feel like this is such a stupid thing to deal with. i genuinely feel like such a loser. it so fucking embarrassing. 
going back to my coworkers. i really like them all individually. they're very cool. however, 4 of them quit in the last few months. but all of them still hang out. 
i dont understand what i'm doing wrong. not even just with them but in general. 
and i dont plan on asking or initiating anything now. i just graduated from uni and im moving away next week. so whats the point of doing something about it now?

528,"so i joined this company just 2 month ago and our team had a year end party last friday. i always come off a very shy and timid ever since i joined but the day we had the drink i wa more loud than usual and now i cant stop thinking theyd think im super weird for acting like that. im a girl btw. i came from a different country and dont speak english a a native language so sometimes i come off a rather strange already? but the day we had the drink i think i wa even more strange than usual. i havent passed my probation yet which make me even more anxious that theyd think im being very reckless or whatever for acting like that. idk. ive been feeling very vulnerable and overexposed ever since, kind of embarrassed a well. i dont know how to stop feeling anxious about this whole thing even tho i know it wa probably not that serious. but i cant stop thinking abt it.",anxiety

531,"in the past couple of years, i have been thinking i might have anxiety. i worry about either the littlest thing all the time, or random big thing that probably are not likely at all. for example, for the past few months, i have only been able to think about the fact that i could be infertile and will not be able to have the life i have dreamed of since i wa little. this is something that should not be consuming my mind a much a it does, considering i dont plan on even trying for a kid for at least another 5 years. 

also (i know this is really common in female in relationships. but i am unsure if maybe it correlate or something) if my friend or boyfriend or even family tone, actions, mood, anything is somewhat off with me or seems different than normal, i will immediately just break down, thinking they hate me and want me gone and that the feeling have been there for a while and theyre just now acting on it because it been pent up for too long. it will consume my mind for so long after it, even if it go back to normal right after. it give me the urge to cut them off and leave (protect my feeling before they have the chance to hurt me first). 

i am just looking for a little bit of advice here. should i maybe think about getting a therapist? or is it nothing to be worried about/nothing out of the ordinary? thank you.",anxiety
532,"i went through a bad bout of anxiety where i became so anxious, id get nervous to do really simple tasks, like walk from one room to the next, fearing i wouldnt make it to the next room. or cut an onion for a meal, fearing i wouldnt be able to finish cooking the meal. getting in the car to go through a drive thru, fearing i wouldnt make it to the restaurant, let alone through the drive thru and back home.


this began for me in early 2021 following a year of grief and massive change. it much better now, but still have issue similar and bout of moment like this. i havent heard anyone discus anxiety in this way, and i am curious if anyone relates and/or ha other anecdote of anxiety over seemingly minuscule thing they never previously were anxious about.",anxiety
533,"i started talking beta blocker for my anxiety and after a day of taking them, i wa having chest pain when walking. i have had some facial numbness and swelling, fast heart rate and chest pain. i dont know how much of this wa psychosomatic yet but i thought i ea having a stroke or a heart attack :( 

i have hour to wait, please entertain me and give warm wish :)",anxiety
534,"after 28 year i have found out why i had depression, anxiety and felt motionless, sleepless etc. so i wanted to create this post.

i am almost 29 now and since a kid i had all those problem which fucked my life. i wa born with tic which caused my muscle to contract at my shoulder, my chest and my leg. i have also made noise with my voice and rolled eye etc.

this year it wa only noise i had to make, because my tic became le the older i became, but it never dissappeared. now i knew i had these tics, but i have never associated them with all the problem that come along with them: bad/no sleep, no motivation, depression, no interests, no power, nervousity, anxiety etc.

i speculated what wa wrong with my all my life. maybe autism, because my interest were restricted to few certain things, nothing satisfied me unless it wa something spectacular and i asked myself how everyone enjoyed life. or i thought i had problem with my thyriod or even add.

this year i found the answer: the voice i made caused my blood to get sucked out my head because i constantly interrupting my breathing which caused my heart to pump wrong. this also explains why my heart hurted so much when i tried to sleep that i thought i may get a heart attack. it took me three month to fight that tic to go away. i concentrated every day not to do it. it wa one of the toughest fight of my life no ignore that tic. i wanted to break out every second but the magic day came where it suddenly stopped the next day and i wa free from it.

now: the tic moved. my brain wouldn't let me win easily. i had to contract my chest and stomach muscles, which directly fucked with my heart. i felt disgusting because this one suck blood out of my head a well and i got cardiac arrhythmia. this mainly caused anxiety. it made this super nervous feeling which come out of the heart area. i am still fighting with the muscle thing but it is almost gone and i feel very very relaxed, quiet and focused. otherwise i would never had to power to write this. i concentrate very much not to do it and forbid myself to contract any muscle.

the heart rhythm is now regular and i don't feel my heart pumping anymore. it work like a silent engine now and the hefty nervousity spike are gone. all my mood and drive is present like never before and i can enjoy every crap.

btw: i had sunken eye (enphthalmos) due to the low blood level in my head, which wa not visible in the morning. i laid flat and the blood went back to the head, but the more i made the tic the more the eye became sunken throughout the day. now it's fixed and i look good again.

i wasted so much time with psychologist and other doctors. nobody could help me. it wa me alone and if you have the same problem i really hope i could help you to understand it. sorry if my writing style sucks. this is my first reddit post. feel free to ask any questions.",anxiety

536,"a few week ago i had the longest dream that i ever had, and in it there wa a segment that told me a reason why im afraid of being in a relatioship.

in that part of the dream i wa living in an old apartment that had a room with mirror covering the wall and a toilet in the center, i sat there and started yelling at myself in the reflections, yelling that i wa a mistake,that im worthless and more stuff like that, when i wa done and got up to leave, one of my reflection didnt move, instead it kept staring at me until it took out a knife an stabbed me in the back, however i embraced that but ended up running looking for help, i knocked my neighbor door and a lot of girl came out, almost all of them were girl that i liked but they couldnt do anything against my reflection (well, i dont know when but more appeared) and ended up dead along with me.

after that death itself gave me an offer to come back to life in exchange for 5 soul but that isnt important. so yeah, that  wa pretty clear",anxiety

539,"i have generalized anxiety disorder a well a agoraphobia and emetophobia (fear of throwing up). agoraphobia is getting a lot better, but not completely. i feel like i have a lot of ocd tendency relating to anxiety because i always have to be sure something is 100% safe. like for example, with my emetophobia, sometimes i will try to make sure the food will for sure be from a reputable place and chance of food poisoning is low. even just in general im like this, where if i feel unproductive, it will bother me until i do something productive because i feel like im running out of time. 

for a while now i have this intrusive thought that continuously bother me. i want to have no phobia or anxiety problem a it a burden. yes, it normal to want to be mentally healthy but for some reason, ill just think, damn i still have emetophobia even though ive had it since i wa a kid and think of all the future possibility of me throwing up/responsibilities and just go into anxiety/depressive mode.

542,"i know thats a weird title, but oh my god it hard for me to stop thinking about it. 

just randomly my arm will just start feeling weird, like when you lay on it for too long and it start feeling fuzzy, you know? and i really cant tell if it happening in my head or it actually happening. 

i check it by lightly putting pressure on my pinky finger with my nail to see if i can feel it and i can. i do that all the way up my arm and i can feel it perfectly fine. i can move my hand like normal and everything. 

ive been taking wellbutrin xl for like 4 day now (previously i only medicated with cannabis but i had to stop using that because i had a really bad trip) and i have been having slight muscle tremor in my leg and butt, which is why i used cannabis in the first place, it made my joint pain, leg tremors, sciatica, anxiety, dissociative episodes, and depression so much more manageable + taking pill make me so anxious even when prescribed and it just been freaking me out i think. 

i used cannabis for over a year constantly, so i guess this is just what my body feel like sober???

i am afraid i will push this person away or never be able to explore relationship if i just get this dark feeling every single time. i feel like trapped or like im not living my life fully if i enter a relationship...i guess some commitment issue there. afraid it will go away or end anyways so whats the point. i cant seem to just enjoy the process or see how it goes....i constantly talk about it.....worried what is the right decision what should i do...etc. i didnt expect to meet someone so soon but i dont want to ruin it",anxiety

563,"
 my 16 year old son had a recital today. he told me he wa a bit nervous. he played very well!  when he wa finished with his song, he said mom look, then showed me how much his hand were shaking.   i felt horrible that he had so much anxiety about his performance. 

he wa diagnosed with high functioning autism when he wa 7 through his school. his dad and i never had him tested on our own since everything with  the school iep helped him significantly. when he wa 12 they decided he didnt have autism but had high anxiety at the time they diagnosed him. he wa doing well socially and had lot of friends.  

then covid happened and they had e learning instead of in class learning. i feel this hurt him significantly, he didnt keep in touch with friend and they didnt keep in touch with him either.  they are basically the same introverted, video game playing kids.  it like they forgot how to socialize or didnt know how to outside of video games. 

his dad and i have 50/50 shared physical and legal custody and have coparented well for over 10 years. his stepmom is a 2nd mom to him, and i appreciate that. 

this bothered me today though. after it wa over, we talked with his dad and step mom for awhile. i brought up driver training since our son ha been very hesitant to take the class.  my son and i talked about it, and we decided online would be the best for him.  his dad and stepmom laughed and joked that he could take it next summer when his 15 year old step sister doe then maybe she could get him out of his shell and he could make friends. wtf!!  they laughed and joked about it, like he just need to suck it up. a a mom, this really bothered me. this isnt just sucking it up, it make him uncomfortable to be in a classroom of mostly strangers, or probably kid who are just dicks. 

i have been diagnosed with severe depression,  gad, adhd and ptsd, adhd in the past year. i didnt recognize his symptom because boy show it differently than girl do. he come across a the most confident, secure young man when he talk to me about life. i didnt realize he wa masking it like i used to, he seems more confident than i ever wa at his age.   

anyways, i am rambling. my heart hurt for him that he is dealing with this. im making him an appointment with my mental health specialist monday. she ha made a world of difference in my life the past year, and i dont want my boy to feel even a fraction of what i have felt in my life. 

i guess i feel guilty for not noticing this.  but,  i need to be his advocate. i would never laugh at my son for not being a social a his stepsister. that is just mean and cruel.  i already know ill be thrown under the bus for taking him to see my provider, but i dont care.  and if they want to prescribe him medication or see a therapist that will help him, im going to stand my ground. he is under their insurance, but if i have to, ill put him under mine even though it super expensive. i hate that he so uncomfortable and feel like that.  i just want him to know life doesnt have to be filled with anxiety.",anxiety

and i actually have proof of that statement. a a teenager i had a phobia that went away because i got what i needed: my mom finally taking care of me. then i wa so afraid of flying but since i needed to fly a lot to see my then boyfriend my brain wa just like ugh enough. but this last one ha this grip on me, and i cant pinpoint what i need to get in order to put it to rest.

here lately well actually for the past few years, i almost feel like i've lost my mind..

it's hard to express just what i mean by that i guess it's a mix of derealization and anxiety.

the idea that you can do nothing wrong and have your life wasted sitting in a prison cell is terrifying. one story in particular terrified me: a guy wa just walking down the street and police took him and he spent year in jail for crime he didnt commit.

because of this reaction, im too scared to even tell a therapist of my fear. i start shaking when this fear cross my mind and i really need help.

i completely realize it irrational, but it just seems like if it could happen to someone else, it could happen to me.

\-what if they think i am stealing? i get this alot, i walk in a store and i just assume that because i am acting odd in their eye then i must be stealing or something and changing room are where people steal stuff alot.

\-what if they think the stuff i picked out isn't good/looks silly on me and they are secretly laughing at me.

i currently struggle a lot with relaxing. i find it very difficult to enter a relaxed mode, both physically and mentally. this lead to a lot of fatigue, and over time, a lot of built up stress. i don't know why, but i am afraid of relaxing, of seeing what's under the hood when my mind is not constantly switched on. 

i try breathing and meditation technique but it marginally helps. i wa wondering if someone ha experienced this, and how they have managed it. 

i often feel like the emotional experience of relaxing will be unbearable, a bizarre a that may sound.

642,"hi r/anxiety, non-anxious 23m here after a short-lived and rocky relationship with a 21f.

she self-reportedly struggle with anxiety. she's done a lot of damage to the relationship until i decided to quit it. i would like to find out if her action truly could have been caused by anxiety, or if she's just a bad person.

i'm not looking for unbiased opinions. i'm looking for opinion that favor her from people who understand her condition. please assume that i did nothing to support her mental health, or even put undue pressure on her.

- she ha a very strong and intimate friendship with her ex. they dated for 3 years, broke up for 2, then i came along. they currently live together in her mother's house. she would confide in him for emotional support because he know her better and can relate to her - even though me, her boyfriend at the time, wa right there.
- said she wanted to move in with me, but when she realized that she'd have to pay 50% of living expenses, she changed her mind, citing her anxiety of not being able to get a stable job. said the added pressure of failing me would be too much for her. she then said she'd be willing to do it if her mother covered her part, but refused to ask her. when i asked her, she got mad at me for interfering.
- generally avoided all serious conversation that need to happen in a relationship.
- didn't want to tell people in her life that she had a boyfriend. generally afraid of commitment.
- lied about wearing jewelry i've given her in public.
- kept using a dating app to make friend - all men. she knew they were interested in her and did not tell them she had a boyfriend. at first she told me about this, but when i told her i wasn't comfortable with this, she started lying about it.
- say she's too anxious to contact a therapist.

since i wa little i have always been a very worried and troubled person but my family ha always disregarded it a just shyness and nervousness. however, a i grew up and everyone started talking about general anxiety, social anxiety, depression, etc i started to think if i do have a mental problem. so i started to pay attention to my behaviour and i realised that i am always driven by some stress which most of the time result in stomach issues. i have also noticed that sometimes without any reason my heart start pounding fast and my right arm start tingling (mainly my hand). it occurs in situation when i shouldn't be stressed and i know there is no need to be stressed but it still happens and i feel like my heart is going to explode and i don't know what to do. therapy is not available to me in my country and it is also very expensive and i am still a broke college student. i cannot talk to my family about it because they don't believe in mental illnesses. so my question is, what do you experience when you have an anxiety attack so i can kinda compare and try to understand what is happening to me?

for the last year and a half i've had severe health anxiety which seems to work alongside ocd ever since i had my baby.

recently i found out the daughter of someone i know died of breast cancer at 28... then a coworker just got diagnosed a week later.

i've had a small pea sized lump in my breast for 10 year now and had a biopsy 5 year ago.. the lump broke apart after the biopsy but then came back a few month later exactly the same. it wasn't cancer... but since then it's remained in the same spot and hasn't grown (near the surface next to my nipple- so it's easy to keep an eye on).

anyway... after the news about my coworker i've been freaking out thinking maybe it's cancer now. i feel my breast everyday and there's nothing else there (that i can feel). but i'm 100% convinced i have terminal cancer... i hate myself because this isn't the first time this happened, and it's over something i've had for 10 years. i guess i'm worried that pregnancy and breastfeeding might have also triggered cancer.",anxiety

i took a break for thirty minute at 12 30 for lunch, then back to my endless march again painting the city with the black of my gloom on a rainy day crossing the street to nowhere and circling back and around back and forth. 

until i end inside the cathedral of the city preparing for the ""misa de gallo"" and i found myself sitting at the end pew of the building and soaking in the emptiness and hollowness of the building and staring at the glitter and meaninglessness of it all in my head.

665,"i would like to preface this by saying i know i've lived a very fortunate life and i feel blessed to even be in this position to be able to post to this subreddit. 

i've turned 21 recently and i still cant help but live a life controlled by the anxiety i have. 

all my life i've been the ""mistake"" of the family. i've never done good in school and wa scolded constantly my entire childhood because of academics. i find that i wa quite needy emotionally and my parent could never provide enough. my father wa always in and out of my life and my mother would constantly move us, living with plenty of different men. because of these thing i found myself going to a different school almost every year from k-10th grade, when i eventually dropped out of school because they wouldnt let me in public school since i wa so behind on credits. i wa 16 when this happened. 

i told my mother i would get my ged when this happened and she effectively just let me do my own thing from there. this is when i locked myself in my room for years, playing video game 16 hour a day and  only leaving the house once every couple of months. i wa already a shy kid growing up, skipping school because i wa so anxious of everything wa a common occurrence, i almost failed 8th grade because i had missed something like 30 day total throughout the year.

once i dropped out, the guilt and anxiety of missing school moved to guilt of not doing anything with my life. and anxiety that i wasnt going to be able to complete my ged because i wasnt studying for it, instead just playing video game all day because i have no discipline. this went on for 2 year straight with very little interference of my behaviors. i would lock myself in my room and no one would try to stop me. sometimes i wouldn't even see or talk to anyone in the house for day or even week at a time. all of this made me incredibly guilty and anxious because i knew i wasnt doing the right thing and yet i felt like i couldn't stop myself. during this time i wa diagnosed with adhd, anxiety and depression ( adhd when i wa 16, anxiety and depression when i wa 17 ) 

during the age of 16-18 there wa little to no interference with my behavior whatsoever, infact i had never gotten in trouble a single time with my mother, which wa something i've never experienced. however the moment i turned 18 thing definitely started changing. i'm blessed enough to have a mother that didnt kick me out at 18 despite not going to school, although that wa under the presumption i would get my ged when i turned 18. well that time had come and i kept pushing it off because i wa too scared of failure, and i didnt feel like i would ever be able to pas it. my mother became increasingly frustrated at this and wa becoming more and more angry with me. my mother wa the only person i've had consistently in my life and seeing her be so angry and cold towards me wa heartbreaking. it sent these feeling of anxiety and depression into overdrive and eventually tried committing suicide because i couldnt bear the guilt of being such a failure my entire life, on top of this feeling of gender dysphoria i had for the past 6 years.

obviously i made it out the other end and thankfully ended up surviving. it didnt change much for me in the long run. a visit to a psych ward ( and 2k debt ) for a couple week and i wa effectively back to what i wa doing before. however this time i decided to really try and get my ged, which i wa able to get later that year after i had turned 19.

because i've lived such an isolated life i had never been exposed to thing like learning to drive a car, or getting a job. thing that most teenager experience at some point. so now i'm 19, had got my ged, and wa expected to go to college with no studying habit and 3 year of almost pure isolation from human contact in a tiny room with a computer.  i eventually went to a local college but i had to stay and the dorms, but i refused to share a room with anyone because of multiple factors. ( mainly the gender dysphoria but also i had not shared a space with anyone in half a decade, i didnt feel capable of it ). so this lead to a very expensive semester for me since i had never held a job in my life, around 22k for the semester. to even get in to the college i had to get my grandma to cosign the loan, which led to even more anxiety of failure, because even more pressure wa being put on the line. 

long story short, the amount of social anxiety i had prevented me from even being able to email a professor about anything. i ended up skipping every class out of anxiety after the first 2 weeks. all of this pressure i've never been used to amounted in constant anxiety attack and i only ever left my dorm room in the middle of the night to avoid other people from seeing me. i ended up leaving that college after the semester and have been living back at home for the past year.

my mother ha been constantly on my case (rightfully so) about getting a job. i tried my best and applied to everything in walking distance of the house since i dont know how to drive. i found a job at a fast food place and worked one day there. it wa the most nerve wracking thing i've ever experienced. they just put me out there and expected me to know how to do everything, this wa the first time i had worked in my life and i get extremely nervous in social situations. i wa so close to having an anxiety attack during the middle of my shift, i'm sure to the other people working there i looked like a hot mess. i wa constantly shaking, i wa dropping customer change in the drive through, dropping food and panicking about dropping it. just all around a terrible experience and i felt so awful about it. the owner had scheduled me for 3 9 hour shift friday saturday and sunday. but after the first day i just didnt come back, i'm terrified of being yelled at and the owner wa someone who would yell at coworkers from what the shift manager wa telling me.

that lead to now. i've turned 21 a couple month ago. i've technically never had a job, i'm mortified of driving because i dont trust that i wont get in an accident and the only experience i have with driving anything is a gokart from when i wa 10 and it wa a terrible experience i still remember to this day. there one store within walking distance realistically and my mother travel often for work so i cant consistently get a ride from anyone.

to be honest i feel trapped, my relationship with my mother ha gone quite south over the year due to some talk we've had about my gender dysphoria issue and the fact that i'm essentially free loading right now. every couple day or so she'll ask me how the job hunt is going and i know she know i'm just bullshitting at this point but i just dont know what to do or where to go. i'm trying to apply to a community college and do online course but i just feel completely helpless. i'm 21, have 25k in debt with crippling anxiety and depression, and i'm terrified of getting a job because the only job i know i'll get accepted at are job that revolve around satisfying customer and that's just not something i feel capable of right now. 

the only thing i'm even holding on to at this point is that i've lost a friend to suicide and i see how that can affect the people that love me, and i cant put them through that. my mother layed in the hospital and cried in my arm when i tried to kill myself. ive never once seen her show that much emotion around me my entire life and i'll never forget it.",anxiety

ive been in somewhat of a tight spot money-wise the past couple of month and been doing side gig on top of my corporate job to be able to comfortably afford gift my loved one deserve. found out a sperm bank around me wa looking for donors, and i thought itd be a good thing to try. id be helping people and getting a little side money. i wouldve stuck with plasma donation but im actually afraid of needle and last time i did it i wa destroyed energy-wise and completely bruised. 

anyways, they contacted me, told me the measurement looked great and my level of education qualified me. went and gave a sample and the sperm count wa more than enough, so they sent me a form for family disease history. took my time with it and answered a accurately a i could with family help, i put down i suffer from anxiety and am on low-dosage lexapro. 

sperm bank coordinator call me the next day and tell me theyve had contentious argument with headquarters on their mental health stance and have switched back and forth at times, but currently, my diagnosed anxiety disqualified me from donating (she almost made it sound like the fact that i wa on antidepressant made it worse). she said she disagreed with this stance but she had to do it. the fact the coordinator seemed so forward with how she disagreed almost made me a little more emotional.

i understood everything she said and wasnt super bummed out when she said it, but the more i think about it the more shame and anxiety i feel about it. i understand that there a genetic aspect to mental illness, but it still hurt to think that all other metric were good but this one thing crossed me out. it make me even more guarded to share my diagnosis with future partner and whatnot in fear they have similar concerns.

the last few nights, a im falling asleep, it feel like i stop breathing. almost like the automatic system doesnt take over, so i wake up immediately and have to make myself start breathing. i realize this sound like sleep apnea and i will talk to my doctor about it a soon a i can. but in the meantime, it happening so consistently, i feel like i cant get any sleep. 

on top of that, a soon a i lay down i get heart palpitations. im not sure if it just because this experience ha been scary and it a psychosomatic symptom of my anxiety related to the issue, or if it a sign that something more serious is going on. i dont have any pain or other symptom like faintness. 

im still paying off the last bill from my unnecessary trip to the emergency room and i have no desire to go through that entire process for nothing. i keep telling myself that logically, if it sleep apnea, it not like they can do anything for me immediately anyway.

723,"ive been smoking weed for a year relatively heavily now. i wa diagnosed 2 year ago but have been showing symptom since i wa very little e.g social anxiety, fear of sleeping (which i resolved at 13), fear of any apocalyptic ending you can think of etc.
i have also been recently diagnosed with add and also depression (which is more reactive based) 

recently i had a big episode when i reacted badly to trying ritalin. i wa told by my therapist to quit smoking weed which made me extremely frustrated. i rarely drink, quit nicotine, avoid sugar, quit horse riding etc (gad ha always limited me). i feel like weed is the one thing i can do, with normally functioning people. 

i of course have experienced anxiety smoking before bc of exam or bc im in public. therefore now only smoke with my bf before bed or a close group of friend and i love it, it relaxes me, make me giggle and make me go to sleep. 
however i keep hearing the immense benefit of stopping. so i wanted to hear opinion from ppl who deal with anxiety day in day out and can actually feel the benefit of quitting/ are regular users/ occasionally take part. 

i am currently in no position to want to quit smoking weed. yes i am experiencing anxiety still. thats my disorder. i have improved massively from where i wa but i wa also in a break down and i don't think ppl understand the level of anxiety i naturally have. 

so i wanted to know what ha actually helped ppl even if just small thing a i have had it forever and am always looking for way to better myself. 

also whats your stance on smoking weed (pls if you have had horrible/extreme experience or no ppl who gave restrain from your story, i do not want to be rude but i want to avoid triggering an episode). 

here are also a list of thing i have tried that have helped even though no one asked (to avoid repeated advice):
-therapy
-adopting a dog (distracting and gave me hope and routine when i wa at my worse) but this is rarely an option for most ppl and gad shouldnt be a reason to adopt however i would advise it if it is something you are currently considering 
-medication (feels like forwever to sort but worth it) 
-group therapy! 
-realising not everyone will understand gad 
-doing my hair and makeup in morning (massive help, fun and make me feel good)
-no coffee duh 
-greeting ppl with a hug and big smile and usually telling them something minorly embarrassing (fake it till u make it) and if im rly anxious before meeting someone write a list of thing to talk about 
-cbt therapy (got me out of my severe intrusive thought episode) 
-even if i havent done anything all day try one task 
-talk to those close to you a it also allows you to set a platform for them to ask for help 
-social medium break and staying with my parents/ppl who understand gad when socially overwhelmed 
-no drinking / smoking weed around exam 
-chatty yoga tutorial for intrusive thought 
-write thing down if theyre stopping u sleep 
-meditation (not for me a i forget/ get anxious but know ppl who swear by it and am still willing to give it a proper go) 
-clean room to avoid overwhelming feeling 
-watching https://youtu.be/nhf56w1ampw and other inspiring youtube recovery vids when i feel hope is lost / rly stuck 
-helplines for dire situations, never solved them but calmed me down 
-finding my trigger and one that trigger both psychological thought process and physical symptoms
-recognise problem within me that hinder my recovery e.g victim complex (hard to accept but should not be shameful but celebrated a a step in the right direction ) 
-sports - did load at school but have struggled since a i am too anxious to join uni team and dont like the gym, any suggestion ? 
-asking for help earlier 
-lists (get the clutter out ur head) 
-prepared night before to avoid last min packing 
-one day at a time -when time are tough sometimes it all u can do until you get a taste of calm 
-""im excited not nervous to do this"" excitement and nerve are very similar 
-breathing technique (i have never suffered a panic attack so dont use them a lot)
-venting and burning a letter (good for anger that keep anxiety provoking thought alive) 
-friendship group change there is nothing wrong with you 
-lumps are usually just lump stay off nhs.net 
- dont google ur fear the clickbait will pop up first, ask someone you trust and who is smart enough to filter through crap
-remember when your anxious ur thought and reasoning distorts 
-use 100% fact to combat negative thought 
e.g i might think a meteor will hit earth and kill me:
-the earth hasn't been hit for billion of year 
-my thought are distorted a i feel anxious 
-no one else i trust is concerned 
-nasa are working on prevention 

 -romanticise ur day (kinda like be more mindful) 
-try have some variation of social life 
-cold shower -for morning jitter 
-limit nap to max 25mins to avoid nap anxiety after
-inspiring movie to keep motivation up 
-gentle tv for when i cant do anything 
-dont look at setback a failure but learning points, what were my triggers, how wa i feeling before and what should i do differently if it happens again
-routine 
-flexibilty 
bit counterproductive to routine unless you have stretching space in ur timetable. but be forgiving and kind to urself aa sometimes you will feel like shit and all you can do is allow ur body to rest or to instead do thing that are selfishly feel good. 

i have more tip i cant think of but i can also answer question about them. not everything work for everyone and i am in no way a model student, just someone who trying (i still have plenty of unresolved anxiety to keep my therapist in business). it is hard work and sometimes i feel completely useless but it worth the taste of the growing good times.

747,"ill try to keep the back story short, i had a bad cluster of panic attack last year that triggered a severe depressive episode with dpdr, panic trigger these symptom for me. so far all my psych ha done for panic is give me hydroxyzine and various antidepressant (not responding to well at all other than lamotragine) 

the hydroxyzine is only fine for my regular anxiety and doe nothing to touch the panic beast. any medication the increase serotonin or dopamine sends me into mega anxiety mode.

finally my psych agreed to give me a benzo for emergencies. ****ive never struggled with dependence in the past and i am very aware of the risks.*****

i asked for diazepam because i have used that in the past and reacted fine. i hated xanax because it made me dissociate. 

last night i wanted to test out the lorazepam to see if i could tolerate it during an actual panic episode.

i could feel it kick in about 30 minutes. i felt very different than i have on diazepam in the past. i would compare it to weed, which i dont like at all. i wa fidgety/kicking my leg nervously, tired and lethargic but unable to fall asleep, fast heart rate, my anxious thought were unchanged and i just couldnt stop thinking about how uncomfortable i was. i wa able to breathe through it before falling asleep 4 hour later. 

i know these 2 drug are supposed to be similar so i dont understand why i reacted the total opposite way. i feel like my psych is just going to deny trying any other in the same class. i read that lorazepam differs from diazepam in that loraz can have an effect on increasing serotonin/dopamine and diazepam doe not. typically this is at higher dos but me and my psych have concluded before that i am extremely sensitive to medication and i metabolize them weird.

752,"ive come to recognise over recent year that the way i think, and the way i act and react to minor situation isnt normal. it all having a huge negative impact on my life and relationship (8.5 year with an absolutely wonderful partner, a house and 2 young child together). 

i dont know where to start to help myself, so if you recognise any of these example in yourself, please offer me any kind of insight or explanation.

- im an emotional person and i cry very easily, but in recent year ive developed a response where my mind completely shuts down at very minor situations. eg. if my partner brings up a problem/concern (normal household stuff) and i feel responsible, i have a freeze response. my body is still, i cant keep eye contact, i find my eye darting to different area of the room, and my mind go completely blank to the point where i cannot speak, and cannot even think of any word to say. if i manage to squeeze out something basic like yes my voice is so involuntarily quiet that it barely audible. 
- i have to make list for everything to get anything done. but i cannot keep on top of the housework - i find myself leaving the smallest task (taking an item upstairs for example) that would take a minute max, for day and weeks. i remind myself of them every time i see them, and i want to get them done, i just dont. these thing build up and then i become overwhelmed with the mess.
- in social situations, particularly groups, i find myself analysing in my mind when i will get chance to speak, and then i find myself suddenly talking over someone. i recognise im doing it, but i just dont stop until ive finished my sentence. then i feel awkward about it. 
- ive bitten my nail very severely for a long a i remember. i hate it, im ashamed of it, but i just cant stop. i even find myself turning away from people to sneakily bite them, without even thinking about it.

at 26 i got pregnant. i had 2 child le than 2 year apart, and ended up with ppd both times. since the birth of my 2nd child, 2 year ago now, i have very slowly crawled back into my agoraphobia. my hormone have not been the same since, my cycle are out of wack, but my doctor dont want to test my hormones. i have been a sahm since my 1st wa 6 month old. best thing i have ever done.

but now i'm feeling so torn. i'm burnt out. i have such horrible anxiety even going to the grocery store down the street. i have had panic attack for the first time in 5 years. i've been seeing my emdr therapist for a year now and honestly i feel like i'm getting worse, not better. i've been asking her to do cbt instead of emdr because i worked through my trauma. and emdr is not working. but she won't do cbt. 

sometimes i think i should go back to work so i can be out in the world again. being home all the time is not good for agoraphobics. but my kid are 3 and under. i don't want to leave them. i want to be here. i want to want to love this. but i'm so depressed.

of course, ever since i turned 18, the expectation of finding a job were present in everyone's mind, and the only thing i could think of is ""how am i going to survive this?"".

i am lucky enough to not actually need the money, even though i live in a third world country, so i managed to somehow escape the situation.

i do, however, get pressured by friend and family from time to time, and nobody understands or accepts that my phobia is actually real and that it cause heavy damage to me, both physically and mentally.

couple of day ago, i wa just minding my own, and received a message from my mom, that a new hotel wa coming to town and they were hiring. obviously, i lied to her and said i did send my resume, which of course i didn't because i got scared to death and my chest wa hurting me for like an hour.

today, however, it got worse, because she told me that an aunt wa in a way, working with the manager of this hotel, and she told me to send her my resume, so my aunt could basically hook me up with them. she also told me i have to go to the hotel personally on monday to deliver my resume.

i got scared, now i feel uneasy because i'm afraid. and this is different because i can't quite sabotage it, also, it feel a if i would probably get the job, because my aunt is going to sort of ""influence"" the selection process there.

i'll admit that i am feeling different than previous situations, it seems a though i'm able to contain the fear and the anxiety, but that is also scaring me a little bit because it probably mean i am just bottling it all up and i can explode at any time.

however, some ""symptoms"" are starting to manifest though, i already feel stressed, started sweating a little bit, i wa planning on taking a nap and now i can't, and my stomach hurt a little bit, which i can tell i'll probably have trouble eating later or in the mext few days.

i guess what is keeping me somehow controlled is the fact that i am able to recognize i might not get the job, even though i said i could, because i know the hotel ha a strict process of selecting it employees, and i don't think i'll be able to skip that, and there's a possibility i fail the process or someone better than me get hired.

either way, everything is coming back and i am struggling to remember what i did before when i went to job interview and such (i have never worked before).

this week though something new started. i have been having these really intense feeling of not feeling like myself. i dont recognize my own voice or even image and it been freaking me out and causing lot of anxiety. it typically start halfway through the day and get worse a the day go on to the point where i just have to lay in bed with my eye closed because everything is just so overwhelming. im really scared.

so far for the past month and so i been stressed and been having health anxiety. im 17(m) it all started around october i wa playing basketball at school and later on that day after i came back from school my left leg had a strange feeling and i didnt know why so i didnt bother to think about it that much. so i wa texting my friend (we not cool anymore)and told him and out of nowhere he said i had cancer, i dont know if he said it a a joke but when he said it i took it serious because soon a he said it i started feeling weird. so i did the worse thing you probably can do i started looking up cancer symptom and notice it wa matching with it. so i started to freak out heart beating fast etc. i tried to sleep it off only got around 30mins to sleep and woke right back up. when i woke back up, i went to use the bathroom and when i woke up i wa still thinking that i had cancer, so while i wa using the bathroom i had a panic attack and had to go to the hospital and etc i convinced myself i dont have cancer.

but while i wa searching that day for cancer symptom i also thought i had a brain tumor. so basically since then i been telling myself i had a brain tumor and i cant convince myself i dont have one. i went to the doctor and got some blood work on me twice. first time they drawn blood from me they saw some thing abnormal, but i wa still stressing out badly when they did it. so the second time they drawn blood everything came back ok. and i just dont know cause them symptom just been getting worse but better idk.

symptoms: muscle twitching, cant sleep (only at night and sleep in the morning, but before that i usually slept at 2-3 am), headache (but not often), trouble breathing (i think about my breathing), loss of appetite ( seem to be coming back), sometimes right side of head would tingle or some, and my right ear feel clogged.

i've been really learning a lot recently about how to get on the right path toward fixing my social anxiety, so that's great.

over and over, i've heard so much about the power of therapy, especially recently, so i've decided to take the plunge and start the search for one. but i've also recently came across various horror story about when therapist actually made the situation worse, and wasted time and money for the person struggling, which make me really scared.

i wanted to ask you all why you believe finding the right therapist is so difficult. are there any solution that you know of so that i can arrive at the right therapist faster?

in other words, if you could make finding the right therapist 100x easier, what would you do?

anxiety is no fun. there are moment where you feel like youve conquered it and are doing better; then come the wave and it feel like nothing ha changed. it like constantly floating in a pool of worry; and you cant even tell if it unnecessary worry or real. it exhausting. it feel like a glory on day where everything seems ok. it almost surprising on day where the wave stay low and you feel like youve made it.   
 

going to a therapist ha really helped. immensely. i developed ocd, she helped me maneuver that. but a the year go by, the anxiety seems to stick around. the only thing that differs is the size of the wave aka the scale of anxiety. how do you deal with anxiety?

edit: my medical student friend told me it wasn't my responsibility to check her bp and all. and he said that maybe when she ha headache or dizziness i can check cu that is sign of hypertensive crisis which can also be life threatening. however, i didn't bother telling her that if she had a headache or something to tell me to check. i just didn't give a shit for like the entire weekend and then on monday when i wa leaving for uni, i saw her in the morning and i got this thought, ""if i don't tell her and if we miss the sign she can die"". but it felt very weird to tell her right in the morning when she had just gotten up to pee and go back to bed. but i felt really guilty so i told my mom that if she complains about it, it could mean that her bp is very high. now i gave my mom this information but i kept it away from my grandmother for like an entire weekend despite knowing it could kill her if she didn't know. and with all my biased against her, i feel like this is attempted murder. what do you think? help me.

i never wa like this. i wa always a great student but somehow maybe because of my age (f20) and mental health issue i play so badly in front of my teacher. he isn't strict to me, he's a great teacher. and i make mistake that i otherwise should never ever do. he tell me thing where i know i do them correctly. but i completely underperform in his presence, also in other people's presence. when others are there, i simply cannot concentrate the way i do when i'm on my own. i cannot let go. i can't immerse myself into my full being and forget the people around me. it take 10-20 minute with the people for me to get comfortable and find the focus to play how i can actually play. sometimes, i can't do it at all. my teacher saw my recording that i uploaded to social medium and he said i sound way better there. so at least he knows.. i really want to change this.
i don't think it's because i'm scared of making mistakes. i'm scared to be seen. and judged. i'm scared to be attacked in my most vulnerable moment (as a musician).
i don't want to make the mistake in the lesson because we cannot continue from where i actually am otherwise. it's 100% not nervousness. it's not fear. i don't allow myself to let to and immerse myself into the piece and the piano. when i'm around the teacher, i feel an inner rush. i feel uncomfortable. i want the situation to end soon, i want to escape. i feel ashamed. ashamed that i play the piano, ashamed that i'm attempting this hard song, ashamed that i'm trying, i feel ridiculed.


can anyone help me?

my piece are very very hard, i've been playing for 14 year and learning with a piano professor. i've had these problem before, too, but i could mentally detach from the teacher and just play. now, i can't.

ps i didn't ""get it right"" once and thought wow it's not going anywhere. i can play that song so well again and again without any mistake in right tempo.",anxiety

835,"i recently started a weight loss journey so i started going to gym and dieting. food have always been a comforter for me but i don't wanna get obese lol so i decided to stick to healthy habits. it is a learning curve (though i have experience losing weight) so the first few week are a bit hard. so this is one of the stressor i have currently.

at the same time, i am trying to finish work i have been working on. i have a deadline. so of course it is stressful. i have been pushing myself over my capacity to finish it.

so for my job, i can typically finish 2 drawing a day. if i push myself and never do anything else that day other than lunch break and work 9 am to 8 pm i can finish 4 drawings. so last sunday i finished 4. it apparently exhausted me because 2 day later i literally couldn't leave the bed. i noticed it and decided to take it easy but my mood really really dropped. and lowkey i feel very ashamed that i couldn't even finish one drawing in the past 3 days. 

sooo, the main problem is people in my life just don't understand why i am sooo tired drawing 4 drawings. one of them is my mom who never understands why i am so down all the time. ""i am tired because my mind is thinking too much about every single detail all the fucking time!"" she's like ""then don't!"" ha-ha wish it wa that simple.

the other is my classmate who is also an artist and she annoyed and hurt me even more. i sometimes feel like maybe i am being a spoiled baby complaining about being exhausted by doing so little. a part of me think maybe they are right and i just need to suck it up. but whenever i try to suck it up i crash and can't leave my bed.

now last week i came back home from uni and my anxiety shot up like crazy because of the health anxiety i've developed since the death of my mother. had difficulty swallowing food, would sweat while eating etc. i have also lost focus. i am alone at home all day until my dad come back home from his job in the evening.

my anxiety around eating ha become better now and i've also started therapy. my physician recommended that i get help because mind issue affect the gut. so today i went to see a psychiatrist and he prescribed me doxepin and clonazepam. my mom used to take both of these so i know from experience that they made her drowsy and gain weight.

it doesnt really hurt, it more so uncomfortable and will sometimes hurt to press on from certain angles. im also very underweight. i asked my doctor about it a couple month ago and he said it wa probably just part of my body being closer to the surface bc im underweight, but i realized that i accidentally gave him some info that isnt completely right. (at the time i thought that i had felt something similar on my right side before but i have never been able to replicate it so idk if i just dreamt that or what. also i wa on my right side for him to feel it bc i wa stupid and forgot which side made it more prominent so he could barely even feel anything)

im slowly getting more nervous about it because ive googled what ligament or whatever could be there that are normal to feel and there is jack squat. i have an appointment scheduled already (just my regular follow up appointment) but it not for another month. im very worried that it could be a growth, and that i would have to have surgery to remove it and even worse, that it would be cancer and id have to go through chemo. a someone with debilitating emetophobia, cancer is my worst case scenario because of the chemo.

we ended up just going home and my heart calmed down on the way there. laid down for a while, then felt nauseous again and went to the bathroom prepared to vomit a fish sandwich into the toilet. heart pounding again, hot flash and now a burning in the middle of my chest. still didn't vomit, and finally went back to my bed where i am now. 

spent a while reading online article about telling the difference between a panic attack and a heart attack, which didn't help because the difference are so vague and slight. then scrolled through this subreddit a while to remind myself that i have an anxiety disorder and that i had been anxious all day up to that point, and also that i'm young and aside from a greasy mcdonald's breakfast sandwich i had this morning, i'm fairly healthy and thin.

after a while it calm down enough that i wa able to hit my vape without worrying that it would make it worse. once i had a little nicotine in me all my symptom kind of abated. i figure if it wa a heart attack or a pe, i wouldn't just go away.

i even sailed through several round of interview and landed a dream job that is a behind-the-scenes writing role - perfect! i have lead several meeting each week at this job and so far had not dealt with public speaking anxiety for almost 6 months. 

but starting a month or so ago, out of nowhere, at a meeting i regularly present info at, i got halfway through my note and had uncontrollable verbal shaking. and not the kind where you can say that nobody else would notice - i saw the reaction happening in real time! i totally froze, stumbled over a sentence or two and just cut off my information to present early. 

i have not been able to get over this since. nearly every time i run a meeting where i present now, i have the voice shaking happen if i talk for too long. no matter what tool i use.

i don't remember what kind of medicine didn't work so i can't even tell the person who's actually taking out my wisdom teeth, i just said the last time numbing shot didn't work and they told me they would take care of it, but even if they use a different one how do i know if that one work when the other kind didn't? i also can't have laughing gas because of a different problem i had so they said they won't give me that. they said i get iv sedation but what happens if the numbing stuff doesn't work again and then the iv doesn't work either so then i'm awake but then i still feel all of it again, and then it's worse than last time because they have to cut hole in the bone in my jaw for this and that would be so much worse and i hate all of this.

two year prior to this, i had bronchitis and developed tinnitus in an ear from over coughing. i know this. i remember it happening.

once i start my period, my lymph node under my jaw ""swells."" i say that in quote because it's not even swollen, i can just feel it there. it's like the size of a small clove of garlic and literally no cause for concern. my pcp even felt it once and told me so. 

a year ago i had an oral screening for cancer. all clear. 

nothing ha changed since then. ear problem, lymph node, and no cancer diagnosis. 

now queue me, a night after drinking, eating red sauce and no water, googling why there's a lump i can't swallow in my throat. 

dehydration? maybe just a little tender? 

no! cancer! panic. 

specifically tonsil cancer. the symptom are ear pain (i don't even have pain, just tinnitus), swollen lymph node (it's not even swollen), and a lump in the throat (i literally drank all night and ate like garbage, probably had acid reflux like a bitch) but nooo, i went spiraling. heat flashes. heart palpitations. chills. sweating. fever. crying. muscle tensing up. jaw locking and grinding. now my throat is really swelling up. 

i've been stuck in this for a week. i'm so fucking annoyed with myself. i always get a lump in my throat in the morning because i snore awfully. always. why did i have to google that dumb shit? fuck. 

now i'm doubting myself, wondering if this lump ha always been here and i've always ignored it. it's such an annoying feeling that i know there's no way i could have ignored it. i mean, i googled it for a reason, because it happened and i noticed, right?

so then i start mashing my finger deep into my neck feeling around. i start sticking mirror and shit down my throat and repeatedly, accidentally, stab the little instrument against my throat. now my throat is sore and my brain is like: see? cancer. it hurt now. cancer.

and, obviously, there wa nothing in my throat. no blisters, no scabs, no blood, no mass or bumps. it's just my same old throat that i had a cancer screening on last year. 

i'm so fucking tired of being like this. i know there is nothing wrong, and even if there is, i might just have a little fucking common cold. is my brain seriously going to go on high alert everytime i cough? fucking hell.

i have no one else to talk to about this and i just need to scream about it before the stress alone kill me. 

i keep scolding myself to calm down but every time i panic my throat just get even tighter and reinforces my worries. i'm literally stuck in a fucking loop. 

i keep telling myself to give it a week before going to the doctor but i'm already imagining myself dead. i keep cry because ""i'm not ready to die yet."" like bitch stop and chill out!! please!

i wish i could rip my subconscious out and beat this stupid bitch up. i'm so stressed out. i know this will pas and i'll laugh it off in a week because i do this every time something funky happens to my health. i can make a forest fire from an ember. i'm so fucking over this.",anxiety

currently i have some pain in my groin / hips. some pain in shoulder a well a right arm. i have also noticed a small change in my voice where sometimes it's a little harder to get the ""sound"" out.  i also have muscle twitch throughout the body.  what started a a twitch on my left thigh ha since moved around my whole body in random part and at random times.  and yesterday for the first time i had a pretty aggressive ""twitch"" or tremor in my left tripcep / arm.  it went on for about 15 minute or so then went away and hasn't returned.

i remember when i wa 7 my family moved country and at the new school they used a different method to ask to go toilet. in my home country you would put your hand up and once the teacher called on you you then asked if you could go to the toilet. in the new school the kid would just stand up and walk up to the teacher while she wa talking and silently make a t sign with their hand and stand there until the teacher acknowledged them and nodded. no one explained this to me so it scared me that i would mess it up so i wa too scared to try. it ended up with me peeing my pant in front of the whole class and them laughing at me because i wa too scared to try ask. it also didnt help a year later when i got the courage to try when i went up and stood by the teacher i stool there for 2 whole minute without her noticing me and then just ended up going to sit down again. this wa the first thing i remember causing huge anxiety but there wa stuff before this too.

ive had selective mutism for a long a i can remember and wa never able to talk to stranger due to anxiety. and when i wa 2-5 i cried every single day when my parent dropped me off at my childminders and also cried every time they dropped me off at dance class. i know separation anxiety is normal for young child but usually it work out in a couple week and doesnt last 3 years. despite these early sign it took until i wa 11 to be diagnosed because my anxiety wa stopping me from going to school.

so basically, my dad died back in 2019. from lung cancer. i wa 10 at the time, and i already knew he wa gonna. you know.
and after he died. i couldn't really believe it? but the grief didn't click in, until september / november, of 2019.
but then at the time, i started going through really stressful, thing like,
 bullying.
 name-calling. 
harassment. 
(these had happened online. i know it may not seem like such a big deal but it ruined my self-confidence, and mental health.)
and it got worse in 2020, because i got abused online aswell
and my mental health, got worse to the point where i had urge to kill / harm myself, (i hardly have them anymore, which i'm glad about.
family issues.
stressed 
almost constant crying


(the reason why i'm saying this, is because it could explain why i'm dealing with the stuff i'm about to put 
down.)
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

december, 8th, 2020, wa the time i got sick.

it wa in my stomach, and i though ""oh i'm just sick it will pass"", but it just got worse. and it would keep, growling, and i lost my appetite fully and didn't even wanna eat. but the thing i realized wa that i wa stressed / worried about it.
because i though it wa stomach cancer. (still do.) and it would make me feel like i wa gonna throw up, 

and in 2021. i still had. it. no appetite still, no nothing. just feeling sick. but i still ate, and drank everyday. but online stuff happened again. (which i think made it worse? idk. and my mental health worse.)
but then i started thinking my stomach wa gonna collapse. and i started worrying more about it.



-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

and in this year, same stuff. with my stomach. but in april 2022. i had a panic attack? i also had left arm ache / pains.
so basically went downstairs, and told my mum about it. and we started talking, about stuff. and i stood up from the chair, and then all sudden, my head started feeling super weird. and i said ""mum my head feel weird!"" and she said ""your probably having a panic attack."" and then i started panicking, and said ""mum, mum i think i'm dying!!""
and i went down on to the kitchen floor.and my brother said ""your fine.""
and my mum said ""this is because of your dad."" and then she went to open the door for me to get air. and i still felt weird. and my hand were shaking. (i can't remember but i think my mouth /lips wa dry.)
but the thing is i felt like i wa forcing the shaking. because i wa making myself shake (but again i probably wasn't. i did not do it for attention, i know that would of been bad. etc i wa seriously scared, that i wa gonna die in front of my mum and brother.) . but when i stopped my body felt like nothing. and my breathing wa a bit weird aswell.
and my mum wa trying to talk me out of it. and then a few minute later, i went to stand up, and go upstairs, but my whole body, and leg felt weird. very weird. but then i felt the whole night, watching tiktok to distract myself.
but then next day, my mum told my older brother that i wa having panic attacks.
that same day, i felt like i wa freak, out and call an ambulance, because i felt like i wa going to die.
and i wa worrying about my health. (still do.)

and i am also getting forgetfulness. feeling like something is in my throat for a few minutes, and feeling sweaty,(doesn't last long.) when i panic over something. stuttering, headaches.
weird head feelings, and weird feeling slightly under my stomach by my hips. dry, mouth / lip sometimes, and feeling like i will gag? on my food / drink now.


and my symptom kept changing. (they still do but not a much a i'm noticing right now)


this may sound gross, but i hate bathing aswell. because what if something happens to me when im taking a bath? what if i die all sudden? so i just rush to get it over with. 
i also never want to eat now bc everything i eat i don't want it any,ore.

i also feel tired quite alot?  (could be my sleep routine.)

this is just a repost.  it feel love i just can't stop anymore.  but i know that i'll be okay. i need to take care of myself alot more than i'm doing right now.

1023,"some context: im 27, severe anxiety and panic disorder, depression. im also 5 month post partum. my anxiety got so bad in my pregnancy that i wasnt functioning. i couldnt leave the house, could barely take care of myself. the only thing that kept me from laying in bed all day wa my kids. my therapist at the time refused to give me any medication because i wa pregnant.

well, i wa put on prozac and klonopin by my obgyn during pregnancy and the prozac did wonders! i ended up not needing the klonopin after a couple months. i wa back to normal

gave birth, feeling amazing. no ppd, then i get back with my therapist who say it seems like the heightened anxiety wa just do to pregnancy hormone so you should be able to come off the prozac now. sounded wrong to me but i decided to give it a try.

well. i am now borderline agoraphobic again. back on a higher dose of prozac, and taking klonopin pretty much daily just so i can function. and i know the more i take the klonopin the higher my chance of terrible withdrawal are, but it the only way i can go about my day without panicking. the only way i can be present with my kid without being a tense ball of anxiety.

and i can feel the prozac starting to work, and i know i need to give it time, but the more time it takes, the more my body is becoming dependent on stupid benzos and i just currently hate myself for it. i just want to be better again. i want to function again. i want to enjoy my life, my kids, my husband.

this need to change. we must shift our collective mindset and recognise that mental health issue are just a valid a physical health issues. no one should feel ashamed or judged for seeking help for their mental health. let's support each other in our journey towards healing and well-being. 

let's extend compassion and understanding to those who are struggling with mental health issues. let's break the stigma and create a safer, more supportive environment for everyone struggling with anxiety.

1034,"tw: ocd. 22f. i have severe ocd, am on medication for the same a well a going to therapy. i am also a final year med student. now i've had a bad relationship with my grandmother. she is a narcissistic and a very bad person. she ha hurt my parent and me in many ways. however she is now part of our family and stay with us. we take care of her. but the problem is, being a med school student i feel obliged to take care of her. like recently her bp wa 180 and i urged my parent to take her to the doc and they did call the doc up the next day and finally went to the clinic yesterday. she is now on medications. now the internet say that when you start new med for hypertension you need to monitor blood pressure. which mean that i will have to check her bp. i don't mind doing it, except i don't know much about it and my parent don't really believe in going to the doctor all the time. like even when her bp wa 180 my parent weren't taking me too seriously about it being an emergency (which apparently the doctor also said wa ok). now with all this bias and all, i don't feel like checking her blood pressure. but being a med student and the only one who know how to check bp i feel like i should do it. i don't know.

edit: my medical student friend told me it wasn't my responsibility to check her bp and all. and he said that maybe when she ha headache or dizziness i can check cu that is sign of hypertensive crisis which can also be life threatening. however, i didn't bother telling her that if she had a headache or something to tell me to check. i just didn't give a shit for like the entire weekend and then on monday when i wa leaving for uni, i saw her in the morning and i got this thought, ""if i don't tell her and if we miss the sign she can die"". but it felt very weird to tell her right in the morning when she had just gotten up to pee and go back to bed. but i felt really guilty so i told my mom that if she complains about it, it could mean that her bp is very high. now i gave my mom this information but i kept it away from my grandmother for like an entire weekend despite knowing it could kill her if she didn't know. and with all my biased against her, i feel like this is attempted murder. what do you think? help me.

edit2: so the other day i checked her bp and it wa 200-205. so i told my dad and urged him to call the doctor. my dad went and asked her if she wa feeling fine and she said she wa feeling fine. idk how but they decided to call doctor the next day. but from whatever i have studied it is important to treat immediately or else they are at risk for stroke or permanent damage. however i didn't argue much and just kept quite. i felt terrible about it but i just didn't say much. i did tell him it wa an emergency but she said that her bp ha gone that hugh before so they thought nothing of it. the next day he did call the doc who told u what to do. he said to increase the dose of the medicine and to check bp once in 3 day because once a day might be too much for her. so i felt relieved. however my family decided to go for lunch. we would be leaving her at home for 4-5 hour unattended without a phone (she doesn't have a phone because we don't trust her). anyway i wa feeling guilty to go out because what if she died. but i still went. i feel guilty about it. i didn't even tell my family that we should not leave her alone or anythinf and that she could get a stroke or something. pls tell me doe my behavior account for murder?",anxiety

after breaking up with my girlfriend 5 year ago, i dwell on not making proactive decions to have a post-glow up. for instance, the average person would deal with their pain by going to the gym. instead, i played a ton of video game and watched youtube. occasionally, i would drink and smoke to numb the pain. one time i drunk texted and called my ex. the next day i felt so ashamed of what i did. i couldve spent my time much better but i made stupid decisions.

i've gone to my dr and a cardiologist and had multiple ekg (fine), holter monitor that didn't catch my big heart palpitation (but noticed some pre-heart beats, benign), ultra sound for my heart (sorry don't know the name) - (valves are fine, nothing to note), stress test (fine). going to get another holter monitor next month.

continuation of symptoms

now i mostly feel smaller flutters, vibrations, pre-heart beats/skips. they often happen in conversation and i can feel a small mental shift in my brain, kind of like a zap of anxiety then bam. but no one know it's happening and i just carry on. more often, is at night when i'm just hanging around on the couch. these never happen when i'm walking/distracted/active. there wa even a couple of month where i had nothing, then it creep back.

medication 

i got 1mg lorazepam from my dr, and i take it rarely, when i can't get the palpitation to stop. but it work really well.  
i started taking a stimulant for my adhd (cleared by dr. and cardiologist). obviously this can increase heart rate/palpitations. overall my general daily anxiety ha gone way down...but i keep getting palpitations, possibly more frequently, but not the big ones, mostly a lot of fluttering.

there wa a day i didn't take my adhd med to see if my heart would be calmer, nah to exact opposite. while i don't know why these palpitation originally started..i think the fear of them ha increased them so much more - and feeling that medical anxiety about taking the adhd med even though i wa cleared/they help so much, i'm still thinking what if they missed something and my heart going to give out? ...its not..but what it it does. if i think about my heart it hurt lol.  


medical anxiety/ emdr

my therapist ha offered emdr for medical anxiety.. i've read up about it a bit and i'm just not getting the vibe it will be helpful. for starters, i can't visualize (some say this doesn't matter), it's a blank screen when i close my eye (aphantasia). and i feel like my memory sucks, so i just don't think i can come up with some sort of connecting memory? on top of that, i don't feel like i have a specific event that gave me medical anxiety? i think i've just always had it, like needles, or even finding out i need a little procedure make me faint.

i'm wondering if anyone ha thought on emdr for this - but would also love to hear if anyone can relate/has experienced this, or maybe even found a way to manage.  it is extremely frustrating that these seemed to come out of no where and i can't get control.

1065,"my anxiety ha been so bad the last while that multiple people have suggested i see someone about it. i spent a solid 45-50 minute in a bathroom earlier today, simply because i wa insecure about wearing makeup, and then sobbing for like 30 minutes. 

my friend, whom i wa texting at the same time a my breakdown, said ""if it's inconveniencing you so much maybe you should go see a psychiatrist."" i told a different friend of this conversation, and he agreed.

yesterday i skipped a class due to anxiety, and today we'll i already talked about today. and my mom said ""you need to go to class, if you think it'd help we can get you a counselor.""

here's the thing, though. i went to therapy like 8 month ago, and i stopped because i wa ashamed, because it wasn't helping and i wa scared the lady would be disappointed in me. and now, everyone's telling me to go see someone, but what if it's the same? or worse, what if i accidentally spill all my issues? i'm not exactly stable, i have a shit ton of problems, and what if they put me in a pysch ward or something? i don't want that. it scare me.

i don't know what to do anymore. do i see someone and risk all the shitty thing happening but potentially get better? or do i just keep doing what i've been doing, just deal with it myself and hope that it lessens soon? i'm m terrified of what could happen if i see someone, but i don't know if i can keep doing this.

i understand logically that these are mostly emotion driven, and even if they are my true constant thoughts, some thing don't need to be said. and yet i have to fight crippling guilt and the need to ""expose"" myself by telling the people in question about them. not everyone need to know every unflattering thing i've thought of them, especially when most were in a fit of anger and not necessarily indicative of my true feelings. and even if they are, a long a i can continue to treat them well, i don't see why they need to know what i think. 

especially when sharing these thought were likely not only cause hurt feeling and damage relationship but could also make my life harder in other way (i am in a position where i am forced to interact with some of these people directly and/or daily and the tension would make life much more difficult).

1067,"hello all, not sure if this will get any traction but am running out of options.

about 3 month ago i suddenly experienced a bunch of weird symptoms: myclonic head jerks, tremor in my hand and jaw, bout of malaise and fatigue, excessive sweating. this sent my health anxiety into high alert a everything wa persiting, however i remained calm and continued exercising and meditating. after a few weeks, it seemed thing were returning to normal and my gp wa unsure a to what it could be.

i ended up having a big night drinking with my family once i wa beggining to feel better, but a few day after the symtoms all returned and sent my anxiety into overdrive. i wa at this stage coming of mirtazapine (7.5mg) and wa subsequently prescribed sertraline (50mg). 

two day into taking sertraline, aside from a slew of other terrible side effects, i noticed i wa having trouble walking down stair and i wa shaking when engaging certain muscle movement a well a in my hand i.e. lowering any part of my body down with gravity, bending down to touch the floor, lowering my toe to the floor from my heel after lifting them. i immediately wa wary but assumed they were just side effect so i reluctantly increased my dose to 100mg at my gp's advice, who then said i should come of it if i'm having this reaction. i weaned off, and on the whole wa on it for 3 week total. i also ended up seeing a nuerologist, who after an mri cleared me of anything sinister, but did say i had a slight tremor on my left side of my body and that my reflex were a bit brisk.

it's now been 6 week since i stopped sertraline. everything ha ceased except these tremors. every possible thing ha been running through my head; essential tremor induced by an ssri, neurological damage, ms, hyperstimulated nervous system from too much stress etc etc. ha anyone had a similar experience on ssris? 

i'm now on prozac(20mg) and olanzapine(5mg) under a psychiatrist supervision, who also belief it my brain latching onto a side effect of the sertraline and that it's all in my head.

1079,"one of the course that i'm currently taking at uni consists of this long time group project that take the entire semester to finish. for context: the course in question teach qualitative research and the current assignment is to code a bunch of interview transcript (it's due sunday). having everyone in the group work on it at once doesn't work very well with the particular software we use, so my group decided that everyone would pick a day and finish their part on that specific day (i got friday). 

i'm extremely nervous about this for a number of reasons: for one, i work rather slow. i'm easily distracted whenever i have to do something that i hate doing. even if i were to start early friday morning, i'm not sure if i'll be able to finish the work that same day. each person ha to code 5 transcript and the transcript themselves are all at least 10 pages.

1110,"in case it wasn't obvious from the title, tw for vomiting and gross stuff



today is wednesday night. sunday night i (20f) got extremely sick at my boyfriend's (23m) house while my dad wa on his way to pick me up. i ended up going to the emergency room with violent diarrhea and vomiting. while in the er, i felt some anxiety but it only seemed to be when i felt like i needed to throw up. i wa discharged after fluid with just a stomach bug. monday evening i wa feeling better and told my bf he could come pick me up so we could hang out for a little. when we were about 15 minute from his house my stomach started hurting and i thought i wa going to have to throw up/go to the bathroom, so when we got to his house i ran inside only for nothing to happen. then i started cry and felt like i couldn't breathe and i didn't know why. eventually he wa taking me home to my mom but i wa still cry until i fell asleep in the car. when i got home i started cry again when i saw my mom and she said it wa probably due to being up until 4 am in the hospital and then having broken sleep all day and being dehydrated and i thought that made sense. 

all day yesterday and today i've been fine, no nausea/diarrhea/anxiety, and i've been sleeping and rehydrating so i decided that i would go over and take care of my bf (who ha the stomach bug) for a little while. i drove all the way out to his area (~30 min) with no problem, stopped at panera for us, and a soon a i got back in the car from panera, i got warm, the tingly feeling in your butt and legs, and pit in my stomach anxiety feeling. felt like that the entire 10 min drive to my boyfriend's house and started cry when i got there. took like 15 minute and new girl to calm me down but i wa able to but i still felt on edge. 

after like an hour my boyfriend asked if i would drive him to urgent care so he can get a doctor's note for work and it immediately started the pit in my stomach again. i cried again, we calmed me down and got confirmation that i could just drop him off and one of his parent could pick him up so i could go home, and then i took him over. i wa still feeling the pit/overall warmth in my body the whole drive to urgent care and then back to my house (~45 min)

is my brain subconsciously afraid of my boyfriend's room because that's where i got so sick and then went to the hospital? i keep telling myself i'm okay, i'm not gonna get sick again, etc but it won't stop. my bf also mentioned that i might feel 'trapped in his room' (he ha a separate basement apartment thing in his parent's house with an exterior door, bedroom, bathroom, and living area and that's the only space in his house i've been in since sunday morning.

my plan a of right now is to wait until friday night and go over with my dad (my mom is disabled it's a lot harder for her to get out of the house) and see if that helps. hopefully being able to go upstairs and talk to his sibling and parent and dog will help too (although one of his dog ha been visiting his room every time he hears me cry )

she told me that if i could see the flesh then i needed stitches. thing is, it's probably the flesh i'm seeing when i stretch my thumb. it's not bleeding anymore but it hurt when i wash it. it's not a huge cut, pretty inconspicuous, and i wa tempted to not cover it up anymore. i showed my mum how my thumb looked like when i stretched it (my thumb) and she told me that it wa healing...

after i went on google i actually had a feeling that it'd take longer to heal because it wa deeper than normal cuts. at least that's the feeling i had that i can put into words. when i told my friend, she told me how two of her nail ripped off the nail bed once and how despite that she wa alright. i know she's trying to calm me down but i can't help but feel like it's different

my counsellor told me to always listen to my body and it not saying anything. other than the feeling i had, it's just anxiousness from the amount of information that i gathered from my friend and how the image of how the cut look when i stretch my thumb flash through my head. my friend is more knowledgeable than me so that's why i think

im terrified it wont last. im terrified of losing my job, alienating my friends, going through another period of depression, losing my dog, the pandemic dominating our life again, being arrested, heck, of my parent somehow finding me. i lose sleep by worrying at least twice a week and expect the worst of anything unexpected.

maybe i should mention that i got all these thing fairly recently. i used to have my own business, but it went under due to the pandemic and i lost pretty much everything. i used to be a very guarded and antisocial person and pretty much assumed that my friend only cared about me for my status, but one of them helped me when i had nothing, and im very grateful for that, and to find out that some of my friend still wanted (and still want) to do with me. i know now that i have loyal friends. i got a new job, and got the dog after i moved out of my friend place because i realized that i dont like living all by myself. it like i wa so used to loneliness before that i didnt realize there wa an alternative. honestly, even before the whole pandemic thing, though, ive always felt like good thing dont last.

for right now, what i do is count my blessing each night. today, thing went well. today, i had much to be thankful for. and if everything go to hell tomorrow, i can handle it. ive been through some difficult time before, and im strong enough to handle anything. thats what i tell myself.

1184,"i dunno if it just hypersensitivity or something but since last december i have been dealing with consistent stomach pain that shoot through my whole abdomen (sides/back too) sometimes getting so bad i want to go to the hospital (but dont because by the time im seen the pain will be gone).

i have had blood/urine/stool tests, ultrasound, endoscopy, and colonoscopy, and besides minor inflammation (they took a biopsy in the endoscopy but the result were all clear), everything wa clear. in fact in some area (like my blood) i am apparently better than normal.

despite this this pain seems to keep on coming. i am on pantoprazole (proton pump inhibitor they perscribed after the endoscopy but before the result came back a clear) and in the morning i have been mostly good (my main issue wa that stomach pain wa ruining my mornings) but it bloat me up in the afternoon. so i have been a bit \*better\* but sometimes when i am even subconsciouly stressed... the pain and symptom just tripple.

take last thursday for example. i wa a bit worried about something but rationalized that it really is something i didn't need to worry about (i have done it before and have been through worse stressful situation without a problem) but then... extreme pain. im rushing to the bathroom 5 time and have completely normal stool (which might rule out ibs since it usually includes diarreah/constipation). im burning up and the pain shoot through me, walking around and doing breathing exercise seem to aggrivate it a bit. i want to go the the hospital but when i get to the thing i wa worried about, pain is gone.

the problem is i keep looking for a physical cause of my issues. even though anxiety/stress seems to be present in all of these instance i keep looking elsewhere for answer ie; what did i eat in the last 8 hours, how ha my physical activity been, maybe it because i didn't sleep too well and my stomach ha slowed down, etc, rather than it being ""anxiety"" especially since it is inconsistant (i can get through big stressful situation with no pain but then for something that is 1 tenth of the stress i am in severe pain), and if i am having a lot of bowel movement i say to myself ""well it ha to come from somwehere right""?

the thing here is, that whenever i like someone, i automatically start feeling like a burden to this person even if this person ha not told me anything like that. sometimes, this anxiety is bearable and it go away for a while. a lot of the time, though, and mostly when i am happy, this anxiety get to a point where i get very scared, to the point of not being able to control my anxious thoughts. a few day ago i wa having a lot of anxiety and told this person thing like i dont want to be a burden for you nor i want you to feel forced to hang out with me. you can always be honest with me and let me know if you didnt want u to keep seeing each other or i know that we all carry some thing inside ourselves that feel a little heavy sometimes, and i dont want you to feel i am something heavy to carry or i have a great time with you, i care about you, and i wouldnt like u to stop talking 
my therapist ha told me that, if people want to leave, me asking for reassurance or telling them how much they mean to me is not going to stop them. if someone want to leave, especially due to them seeing my anxiety a something bad, it simply wasnt meant to be. i also have been told that, if someone want to be in my life, they will understand that i sometimes get anxious, but they wont see it a a problem or a a reason for them to leave. 
i feel like i really ruined thing by asking him what i asked him. it a weird thing, because i tell him that he can be honest with me if he wanted u to stop talking, but at the same time, i tell him that i wouldnt like u to stop talking because i really appreciate him. it make no sense, just a my anxiety. some moment i feel like asking if we are alright, then i ask him and he say we are alright, then i feel like i have made a mistake by asking him. 
i also would like to note that this person told me that, when im thinking in an anxious way, i have to remember not to let those anxious thought get into what we have. 
tl;dr: i just want to be able to be myself with this person, but i feel that if i am fully myself, with my anxiety included, this person will want u to stop talking, and i wouldnt like that. but, at the same time, if i cant be fully myself with someone, then whats the point? i dont want to hide myself in order for someone to accept me. if someone doesnt want to talk to me anymore because of my anxiety, is it my fault, or is it just a sign that this person wa just not meant to be in my life?

1210,"hello, reader.
first thing's first, i'm writing this today in hope that someone who's experienced the same thing stumble upon this and hopefully feel inclined to leave a message whether it's sharing their experience or providing me with tip on how to overcome it if they've managed to do so successfully. seeking solidarity and friendly advice, it would mean a lot to me. it's hard out there, you know. 

so.. i'm a 28 year old female.
i'm passive, i'd say low energy half of the time. love crochet and some story based video games. i'm in a happy and healthy relationship. 
and i struggle with major depressive disorder and anxiety.

my experience with that ha been mostly the following:

wake up in the morning, feel intense anxiety and dread of the day. dreading the responsibility and the need to get up for work. 
it feel pretty much like suffering. it always feel like there's impending doom, like i'm bound to suffer, cry, feel intense panic and maybe even off myself at some point in my life because i'm just not happy with the way life is structured and i don't think i ever will be. (having this need to work and then only having a few hour a day to myself to repeat it all again 5 day a week for year and years). 

weekends barely feel like day off a there's so much to do all of the time. whether it's an elderly family member that need my help and only count on me, or piled up chore at home that need to be done or friend seeking quality time etc. 

i feel like a failure because i've had a family owned business job for nearly a decade and the two job i've held outside of it i've quit due to how those affected my mental health but i'm not exactly making enough money or getting benefit or paid leave at the family job and so.. i can't exactly look to stay in it forever but i can't seem to find happiness in any other job. 

anywhere with rude customer a something common is a no for me. i don't do well with rudeness or any dense, negative energy for that matter. and i don't do well if time management is entirely up to me.

i'm in a constant journey, searching for what kind of job i could earn more money from and feel at peace with or happy with.

i have serious work to do with my self esteem and pessimistic perspective of life but the latter is extremely hard to shake off. 

i could go on but i appreciate you reading up until this point and i'll leave it at that for now. 

any advice, tip and support is deeply appreciated. 

take care of there, you're not alone.",anxiety

1215,"hi there, so ive been taking mirtazapine(15 mg. ) since my anxiety came out of no where and completely prevented me from sleeping. after a few month of therapy and medication, ive felt so much better and felt like mirtazapine is only helping me sleeping at this point cause i am now better at coping with day-to-day anxiety. so i decided to reduce 15 mg to 7.5 mg and my insomnia and twitching when falling asleep came back. this made me lose confidence in treating my anxiety. i wa confident when i read claire weekes book where she said that we wont need a sleeping aid forever and many of her patient happily came off once they dealt with anxiety. anyway, i guess i want to hear from someone with coping experience if you ever came off sleeping aids/meds once your anxiety is treated and if there any helpful step (like a self-help book recommendation). im probably gonna talk about this to my therapist but i want to hear from someone who personally dealt with anxiety and sleep trouble also themselves also.",anxiety

1236,"okay i am not sure of the trigger of my symptom but this are the likely trigger and the symptom below:

1. from early last year i had anterior pelvic tilt that caused my breathing to be more shallow and my general posture wa out of whack. this caused pelvic floor issue like constipation, ed and made me very stressed.

2. mid last tear, i got a prolapse due to the pelvic floor dysfunction and this stressed the hell out of me for a long time due to the fear of the complication and since surgery doesnt really work. i wa in fear, panic health anxiety, etc due to this.


3. late last year i had the vaccine and wa sick after this for some weeks; i later got better but still i remained fatigued and i started to have digestive issue like constipation, diarrhea, etc

subsequent to this, from early this year till now i started to get the symptom below:

- my breathing became very shallow (feels like i am not getting oxygen)
- i am usually very hot unless the air conditioning is put on
- i feel very nervous and get panic attack (e.g from the sound of calls, emails, door knocks)
- exercise intolerance 
- dizziness and blurry vision
- trembling 
- insomnia (i never feel rested and wake up in intervals)
- headaches
- i feel sad and in a bad mood

a month ago, i came across the 4-4-4-8 breathing exercise (which i did with my back layed down and my knee raised up) and for the first time in the year i started to feel like all of those symptom went away;

- breathing got better
- i wa happier
- constipation went away
- i slept beautifully etc

however if feel like the result are temporary and that i relapse after a day or even some hours.

now i have heard people say different thing like:

- this is purely anxiety disorder 
- some say it is problem with nervous system and that the breath exercise stimulated the vagus nerve
- some say it is caused by covid or the vaccine.

is there anyway to be sure that this is dysautonomia or just anxiety? how can this be resolved (any success story)

was dx later in my 20 with ptsd, then adhd when i took college class and struggled i told my dr my symptom he did some assessment and dx me 

i very likely have other un-dx comorbids (my oldest is dx asd and definitely see similarity with my symptoms/behavioral patterns)

my last counselor who wa amazing and taught me how to use cbt and actually listened to me took a better position elsewhere. i wa transferred to this guy.

i basically begged and told him i will struggle immensely without counseling, i always wind up in dark place mental health wise, but my anxiety symptom have improved a little bit in the year he seen me (because i see a counselor which in turn helps) so he said he graduating me from counseling.

i feel insulted, if he doesnt want me a a client say were a bad fit and allow me to find a new provider, dont b.s. me like im a naive child.

dont tell me youll find someone who will provide a specific therapy to help with my comorbidity that i told you i struggle a lot with weekly and just pull this awful line of b.s. 

ive literally never heard of someone graduating counseling in the 30 year ive gone (quit for a while, when i wa still too young to understand and accept help), 

such bad fit and imho a counselor who need to work on their communication skill and learn some new tool for not infantilizing patients, 

listen to your client and be honest if you think they should seek help elsewhere. 

at least the nurse practitioner that fired me a a patient wa honest that she didnt believe in the therapeutic use of cannabis for pain after i voluntarily quit opiate pain medication that wa prescribed to me daily for 3 year especially because i watched my mother become addicted to them and die in part from them 
(13 year ago this week) 

and wa honest that medical cannabis is the only thing that stop my neck spasm and debilitating pain from my diagnosed cervical degenerative disc disease and i rationed and used only sparingly at night while also being prescribed medication in the morning for adhd, 

which it always wa positive  in my urine screen because i have documented adhd and used it a prescribed to treat my symptom of adhd 

but my urine wa also positive for the thc which she knew would be there because i wa honest and told my prior doctor (who wa fine with it) and also told her that i have a mmj prescription and card in a state where recreational is legal anyway 

and she flat out said she didnt believe in it 

i got a lil at the headache of finding a new doctor but found a good med management dr so it wasnt really something i wa bothered enough to stew about, 

at least i didnt feel infantilized by whatever false participation award you thought youd use to excuse yourself a my provider and even more insulted you thought id just forget the empty promises, because now i what, have a fucking fake graduate degree from being counseled. fuck you, and the enormous waste of my time it wa talking to you.

im just. am i wrong to be upset?

1271,"hi, im a 23f, non drinker, non smoker, wa using a vape consistently, but have limited myself to only after meal recently. 

im asking for opinion because i recently lost my job, and i really cannot afford to rush to the er unless this is a true emergency (urgent care are all closed now &amp; my gp is booked out months) and im having a hard time clearing my head enough to decide if this is something i need have seen immediately. 

heres a little bit of background: 

i have been having chronic chest pain and shortness of breath for the past almost 2 years. i have had it checked numerous times, but the only recent (a few month ago) test ive had done wa an ekg. i had a chest x-ray and blood work done over a year ago. 

i have been told that it gerd, reflux, anxiety, costochondritis, pleurisy, and probably more that i cant think of at the moment. i learned to deal with it and use a heating pad pretty frequently. 

yesterday afternoon i got a very sharp pain in the right side of my chest after walking to the bathroom, i tried to take a deep breath a this usually help but it got much worse (pain lvl 7/10). it lasted about 15 minutes. the rest of the night wa pretty okay other than some sharp pain here and there under my rib that only lasted a second. 

the last week or so, if i walk long distance ive also noticed im more short of breath than normal, hard to catch my breath and i have to take shallow breaths, and i also get the sharp pain in my rib and chest. 

fast forward to tonight, all day i wa okay, just more tired than normal, but a few (5ish hours) hour ago i started getting a very tight and heavy feeling in the center of my chest like someone is sitting on it, and the same feeling under both of my ribs, the feeling in my rib feel more so like a squeezing feeling though. ive had a few small sharp pain in my back, chest and rib here and there (none lasting more than a few minutes). i feel short of breath still. im also still extremely tired to the point that i cant bring myself to care, but at the same time im also nervous. im going back and forth between not caring &amp; worrying. i cant get comfortable though, all position feel uncomfortable. heating pad isnt really helping at all. 

side note: i dont know if this will be relevant at all, but about a month ago i noticed a bruise the size of a plum on the back of my left calf, it wa very dark and took a week to finally start to fade and it got splotchy looking. the pain wa very minimal, just a slight ache. it didnt hurt to push on. no redness or swelling. i dont remember hitting it on anything. 

just looking for opinions, if this is er worthy or if i should wait until tomorrow when i can get to an urgent care.

1272,"backstory: i have been suffering with depression and anxiety since my teen and just recently reached out for help at 22. it wa a struggle of a year, going through medication change and side effects/withdrawals, like major brain fog to the point i couldnt string together words, extreme fatigue, etc. currently im on bupropion and have been seeing a counsellor at least once a month.


i somehow landed an internship at a small, very tight knit advertising agency after frantically applying everywhere because i couldnt land a full time job for the summer. i had graduated from a degree with an advertising major a year or so back, and even thought i knew i didnt want an job in advertising i also wanted to use it to get me a job because i wa turned down everywhere else. on my first day, i found everyone in the team is extremely extroverted and i felt so out of place being introverted asf. nothing negative about anyone, everyone wa so nice but it felt like i wa intruding or like bringing down their vibes. 
ive always had problem with social interactions, and may even have social anxiety. i avoid loud places, dont do large gathering and party and dont rlly know how to talk to people. i feel the same here. 

that night of my first day there, i dont know where it came from, but i just bawled my eye out to relieve everything i wa holding in, maybe it wa social fatigue from putting on a face all day or just general anxieties. when i think about it in my head, im like i can do this, you cant get get rid of this opportunity, but when i go in i have an anxiety attack when i first sit down at my desk and have to hold my tear in, until i settle around noon. if i tell them i cant do this anymore, i have feeling of guilt and shame and i could never do it in person, so it would need to be an email which make me feel even more shameful. but i dont know if itll get better or if itll get worse, which will in turn affect my performance on the job when i already feel inadequate. i dont see myself a future in this industry, but a part of me is saying i also got an opportunity that other would kill for so why waste it. 

in my head im tossing up thought about taking care of yourself first, and wondering if i pushed myself out of my comfort zone too quickly. im so desperate for change and improvement but mental health take a very long time to work on. while my mental health ha improved to a point where i wa able to actually ask for help, im not sure if it ready to take such a big leap.

hey. so tldr i have briefly mentioned these thing to a doctor who know that i have been prescribed anxiety med before, and i got referred to cbt. what im wondering about is how typical my symptom are for anxiety, a my therapist and the doctor seem to stress overthinking of actual life-related situation a a part of gad, which i dont really relate too a lot. i check out all of physical symptom for it, but most of my fear seem extremelly bizarre or irrational. i get intrusive thought of harming myself, other people, sometimes when im trying to sleep (or if im very distressed in broad daylight even) i get what i would call a slideshow of extremely disturbing gore image (in my head). i also hear a lot of voice saying nonsensical shit when im trying to sleep, but im assuming it pretty normal when tired. i also get kaleidoscope vision a lot, and sometimes i get paranoid about shit like losing control and harming myself (i once couldnt get to sleep because i wa convinced that i could wake up at night and unconsciously rip skin off my face) (yeah i know. lol what?). i also feel completely detached most of the time, it like my skin is foreign. i get that overly worrying about going insane is a feature of anxiety but idk when it count a just worrying and something being wrong on a deeper level.

i developed some not fun gi issue (acid reflux namely, chest pains, other gut issue like small pain here in there, loud noise when processing food) since that day 12 day ago, that is daily now. never had gi issue in my life. i am now seeing a gi doc.

also, the panic/anxiety now come and goes, daily, without warning. i have completely dropped caffeine/alcohol, changed my diet (lost 15 pound in almost 2 weeks), exercise enough, etc.

my pcp ha me on bp pill (since i have been high for a year or so) now (started 8 day ago) and acid reflux ppis (started 8 day ago) and she also  prescribed me trazodone for the sleep insomnia issue + minor anxiety  (was getting hypnic jolt trying to sleep) - which ha helped big time. not without side effect though. i sometimes get dizzy, lightheaded and have some muscle pain due to these meds.

was my anxiety/panic just hidden, and had a huge blow up due to me not taking appropriate step in talking out my feelings, etc? i don't feel all that stressed.

i've been dealing with dpdr for nearly 4 month now stemming from a series of panic attack i had while out in public during the summer. this actually isn't my first time dealing with dpdr. i had a spell about 8 or 9 year ago but it didn't last long, maybe a month or 2 and i completely forgot about it up until when i had these recent panic attacks. i don't really remember how i recovered. i think i watched several video on youtube around the subject of dpdr back then which helped, however i can't seem to find them anymore today. it's weird though because the spell i had back then feel like a walk in the park compared to this beast that ha emerged.

anyways i've had just about every symptom that come with dpdr. from existential fears, brain fog, depression, visual symptoms, fear of going crazy, etc. i'm sure you've all heard of or experienced them all before so i won't go on. the first month wa truely awful. just nonstop fear and thinking that something wa terribly wrong with me and it couldn't just be anxiety and dpdr making me feel how i felt. all of these symptom give me anxiety still. maybe not quite a much a in the beginning, but i still notice them and react to them with some form of anxiety or fear when they occur. i've read and heard that for dpdr to go away, you must treat your anxiety so they lessen and then dpdr gradually go away.

i guess my 2 major source of anxiety right now revolve around sleeping and agoraphobia.

in this current spell of dpdr, sleep ha been very weird for me. in the beginning i would struggle to get more than 4 or 5 hour a night, waking up several time in the early morning. i also had an episode of sleep paralysis which terrified me and made it hard for me to want to go sleep knowing it could happen again. i've also been having what i think are hypnagogic hallucination and auditory hallucination a i try to drift to sleep which also freak me out. and i've been having the weirdest vivid dream that freak me out too. like when i wake up, i'll feel like i'm still in the dream and that feeling lingers for several hour after waking up. i've actually felt this way from vivid dream before this spell of dpdr, but i wouldn't feel fear from them or spend much time thinking about them all day. i've also had this weird strong sensation of like deja vu sometimes when i'm in bed. it's like a strong feeling of deja vu, along with a memory of what i dreamt the previous night. it'll make me feel like a rush feeling in my stomach. it usually only last about 15 or 20 second at most but i'll feel panicky after it happens. all of that make it hard to feel relaxed and i feel anxious when it come time to go to bed knowing that i may feel any one of those things. this make it hard to get good meaningful sleep. some night i'll get 6 or 7 hour but it won't feel like i slept well. i haven't had a really good night of sleep since before this began. i know that getting good sleep is key in helping with your mental health too so the burden of not getting enough trouble me too.

the agoraphobia began to affect me a month into this spell. it started with a fear of having a panic attack while away from home. i think that's understandable because i actually have had several panic attack while outside of home this year. but i also notice that my dpdr will come on a lot stronger when i'm outisde. it's like thing like tree or the sidewalk look way too hd or real and it freak me out. then exsistential question will start popping up, then i'll remember time i've panicked outside and it lead to me feeling... panicked. also, before i go somewhere that i've planned to go, for example the supermarket to go grocery shopping, the day before or hour before i'll spend time thinking of how i'll feel during the whole trip. will i feel anxious? will i feel the dpdr? will i think exsistential thought which lead to panic? this make it harder for me to actually leave home and sometimes i'll just cancel my plan and stay home so i won't feel any of those thing i think i'll potentially feel. i've managed to not really think or feel that way within about a 3 or 4 block radius from my home. maybe because i know i'm close to home and can return quickly. also if i travel by car somewhere i wont really feel the anxiety or dpdr a much. i guess it's mostly when i walk places, i'll remember that i had panic attack when walking somewhere.

i've watched so many video and read so many forums, book about dpdr but nothing ha helped a lot. only certain moment of relief but i'll just return to feeling the same dpdr. 

i've also been going to therapy for the past 3 months. i like my therapist, she's very kind and understanding. she's new and became a certified mhc earlier this year. she actually told me she's felt dp before. i'm not sure if it's been helping though. it definitely help to talk to someone but i'm not sure the coping and grounding technique have been working for me. i find it hard to digest and remember everything we talk about too in our session because of the brain fog. which i guess make it hard to remember and apply these technique in the moment where i can really use them. 

it just really suck knowing you don't feel normal and nothing ha really helped.

i'm just going to provide a bit of backstory to hide the potential trigger from scrolling view. essentially my husband and i moved from michigan to arizona december of 2020 so my husband could be back with his child and find his dad. his son and ex moved to washington fall of last year and his dad ha not only been found, but he's off the streets, sober, and thriving. i had been trying to convince *my* dad to move here since we moved, he's suffered from health issue since 2017 rendering him disabled, and he wa homeless since the beginning of his disability. i finally convinced him, we were building a plan, and he wa packing to move to temporary housing to regain his footing when he passed. 

since his passing, not a week ha gone by without at least one panic attack so severe i get physically ill for over 12 hour at a time, last week i literally thought i wa having a heart attack my chest hurt so bad. i wa already having a hard time, i already missed him more than i would miss air, about 1/4 of the homeless population in the area would set me off emotionally, but now i literally just can't leave the house. any homeless person set me off because all i can think about is how i wa just a little too late saving my dad.

as you can tell this isn't a very.... productive environment for my mental health. i feel very isolated being so far from my family, who is pretty much all disabled and sick so i feel like i'm just sitting here waiting for the next midnight call from the hospital, i have a high stress job i immediately jumped back into after my dad's funeral, my relationship ha been ***rough*** for month before my dad's passing, and pretty much all of this led to our decision to move back home. 

i've had to pull this 2,000 mile move out my as with no money in 2 months, i'm currently working my last week, we anticipate being on the road in le than a week, and i'm going insane. every call from and unknown mi number freak me out and it only getting worse, anytime i miss a family member's call and they don't leave me a message set me off, looking at all the stuff i still have to pack a well a the fact i literally don't have room to move around my tiny as apartment because i've already started packing is freaking me out, there is not a single ""break"" in any day.

then, once we've finally closed this stressful job and packing chapter, i have to drive across the country ***by myself*** (because when i did it last time i ***begged*** my husband to learn how to drive and he still hasn't) transporting two cats, a dog, and my husband, we'll be staying with my mom for a couple of week who won't let me grieve my dad because she will be too busy grieving her ex-husband of 21 year and need my emotional support, a well a my autistic brother who is finally starting to grieve, all while trying to find a place of our own.

things like playing game and watching too many video essay which would consume my attention and make me feel bad for wasting time/being a coping mechanism.

1342,"i'm currently bawling my eye out trying to make sense of my life now. 
hurricane ian took off half the roof of our rented house. i loved that house. we stayed with my brother for about a week and then, we had to move into a temporary rental through our rental agency. when we moved into that rental, i got covid (i'm assuming from one of the crowded grocery store after ian) i tested negative two day in a row after a full two weeks, conveniently our rental agency contacted u the day i tested negative telling u we need to clean the broken house a the owner wasn't happy with the clutter (it wa cluttered because we had pulled thing inside and left them the way they were.) so we obliged and cleaned everything top to bottom.

the next day i spent the whole day with my aunt and grandma who live with u and i tested positive again that same night, and that's when they finally caught covid. during covid my immunocompromised grandmother had a mini stroke and is now suffering dementia like symptoms. we'll get back to that. the owner of the temporary rental we were in decided they were going to sell the house while we were still in it and do open house once a week. my husband called our rental agency and told them that wasn't going to fly with the house having covid and u having a 2.5 year old daughter. he told them we are going to need to find a new place pronto. she basically said don't wait. we found a nice four bedroom place, and luckily fema helped u and we were able to pay everything to get in. the manager at the rental agency flipped shit on u for not giving her notice??? but she told u not to wait. guess she wasn't expecting u to find one so quickly. they're on our as about getting the rest of the stuff out of the broken house because what do you know, two day after we said we found a new place then the owner of the broken house began renovations. so they're threatening eviction even though we don't live there and haven't lived there since early october, we just have thing in the garage and technically still have a lease til the end of this month.

so anyway, back to the main storyline here. my husband and i moved the entire broken house in one day minus the garage, while my aunt and grandma stayed at the temp rental because of the covid. our daughter stayed with my sister in law and her cousin for about a week and came back with some type of diarrhea bug that lasted almost three weeks, and grandma who is suffering long covid kept getting confused and then she fell off the bed so she had to go to the hospital. a week later when she came back it wa just the icing on the cake. between my daughter having diarrhea, my grandma seemingly a different person, a new house, new neighbors, etc. i felt like i never did before and i wa thinking heavily about suicide. so i went to the er and ended up in a psych ward for a week, i am bipolar 2 and i have severe anxiety. im on medication that doesn't do anything besides make me feel horrible. i've been feeling awful today and it's been almost four week since the psych ward. i've been staying with my dad trying to get my shit together but today i almost feel worse than the day i went to the hospital. 


i go home saturday and i'm scared to go home and stressed to go home. i can't stop worrying. worry about my daughter, even though she's fine now. my grandma and her long covid, worry about my relationship with my husband. worry worry worry about everyone and everything and in even worrying about thing that more than likely 99% won't even fucking happen. i don't have a psychiatrist and the only one who can take my insurance is booked until february. i've tried sesamecare doctor but no one want to listen. my primary care doctor know all of this, i even had a fucking seizure from my medication combo yesterday. last week she helped with new med but now when i try to call her she tell me i need to speak to my psychiatrist about my mental health meds. even though she know i can't see one until february. i'm at a loss. 

i looked at picture of my husband and daughter an hour ago and can't stop bawling. i miss them and love them and i want to be me again but i've fallen so hard i've lost it. i can't stop the way i feel and i'm so over this i'm exhausted and tired.

the speaker started her speech with ""we fight everyday for our, oh god!"" the same people in front of me started sprinting towards the washington monument. at that point, i knew this wasn't a drill. this wa the real thing. i started sprinting to the washington monument a well. 

i thought that this wa it. my life is over. and i wa going to get shot. i ran in a zig zag line to make myself a harder target. i felt so much at that moment. fear, dread, hopelessness, feeling stupid that i ended up at the wrong place at the wrong time. at a gun control rally of all places!

now, i wa started on birth control november 31st, 2022, everything wa going fine besides some cramping here and there. however, i didn't realize that the chance of getting blood clot rise when on birth control. 

i stopped taking them, i only took 11 before i stopped and i began to heavy bleed. and well, my thigh ha been bothering me. it isn't red or swollen, but i have officially stepped over the line of panic. i haven't been on the birth control for three day now. i went to urgent care yesterday, and also met with my ob who instructed me to just continue to take the pill bevaude she didn't see any redness or swelling, if pain didn't go away then we would worry.

1356,"hey guys,

i have been suffering with pretty fucking crippling anxiety for a number of year now. the type where even if you would never admit it, when someone else complains about their anxiety you know theirs is nothing compared to what you are going through. the type that make everyday last over 24 hour because you cant lay still for more than ten seconds. the type that make you think you will never be your old self again and menial thing like eating, brushing your teeth or leaving your bedroom will kill you. the type that i see a lot of people on here dealing with.

i started therapy about two month ago after being in the worst state i had ever been in, i remember my therapist telling me he would be able to help me and i didnt believe him. 

the last month ha been the most liberating, happy and freeing time i can remember. that feeling that you have dreamed of, of life without anxiety exists. yes, it may not be a quick process and yes it may come back again, but be assured that your life wont be like this forever, because if i had known that this wa possible for my life i could have probably avoided some real dark places.

32 y.o male with gad, depression, suicidal ideation, and too many physical ailment to list.

like tonight. i feel like i'm coming down with a cold (no big deal on it own, did an at home covid test to be safe, it came back negative, but ive had covid before so we are wondering if a lot of my medical issue can be pinned on long covid), but then i started having trouble breathing and started to feel like i wa going to faint. used my oximeter and my blood oxygen level is fluctuating between 88-95. 88 is on the cusp of danger levels, and on top of that my heart rate hit a low of 58 (my heart rate rarely even hit 70 at the lowest). when i told my mother about this (she's usually the only one up around this hour. i texted her around 2 pm pst) she basically said don't worry about it you'll be fine just go to sleep.

now, i know that not to be true. a quick search will tell you that 88 spo2 could be a medical emergency. after i wa done searching, i began getting a somewhat sharp pain in my chest on the right side, and a weird prickly hot pain on my back, in the spot right between my left shoulder and my neck.

so basically i have no idea what's going on. i've had absolute garbage luck with the er near me so i'm gonna try to wait it out and get to one of the urgent care the second they open. the last time i went to the er they ended up giving me something for stomach pain which a. didn't work and b. a hour later made my anxiety so bad that i had threatened to my family that i wa going to end my life.

i'm just so tired of everything medically wrong with me. but waiting for referral to go through for like 5 different doctor (gi, psychiatrist, sleep specialist, dermatologist, and cardiologist) ha just been making my mental health worse. 

sorry, i just needed to try and distract myself from the pain. once i hit end it's all going to come right back...

mine go from 0-100 in an instant.  it usually start with intense nausea and intense abdominal cramping along with an intense pain/buzzing feeling at the base of my skull.  within second the room is spinning, my vision start narrowing down like a pinpoint in the middle, and my whole body is tingling like my limb fell asleep.  i become uncoordinated and get very scared, and usually i faint.  sometimes i vomit or have diarrhea right before i faint...meaning i fall off toilet or bang myself up pretty bad.  i should also mention that i have emetophobia so the feeling of needing to vomit make me scared to death. 

sometimes i wake up from fainting and feel better, but heavily disoriented and exhausted.  sometimes i wake up from fainting and go right back into the attack, fainting multiple time over a short period of time. when that happens i usually cannot get up and resume normal activity for 4-12 hour after.  if i were to get up and try walking around for instance, my vision will go black again and i will feel like i am going to faint.  i have to lie down and either sleep or just not move until the feeling passes.   i no longer have that overwhelming terror feeling after fainting the first time, i just feel absolutely exhausted in a way i cannot describe.  like breathing take effort.  

my husband ha witnessed my attack before and say when i faint that i'm only out for a matter of seconds.  when it happens it feel like decade have past.  it's hard to describe.  my attack come out of nowhere and i don't feel particularly stressed or anxious about anything when they happen.  i have never been able to link them to any specific triggers.

it sound absurd--but i can't stop this thought cycle. i should also mention i feel this anxiety (and have always felt it) when i'm going into an elevator or into an airplane.

i don't think i'm schizo or at least i hope not. i am ocd, however. and i've always had these fears--they've just become far more loud in recent weeks.

what is this?",anxiety
1431,"ive always had severe anxiety for a long a i can remember. i know ive had panic attack from situation that invoke anxiety, but there are a few weird ones:

- first wa the most concerning. i suddenly felt a tingling sensation running from my back down my arms. i got extremely hot, wa dripping sweat, my heart wa beating out of my chest, and i lost all feeling in my hands. couldnt move my finger or make a fist. this lasted for about 5 mins, thought i wa 100% having a stroke or something. mentioned it to my dr and he wasnt remotely helpful and said my vitals were fine. nothing specifically (mentally or physically) triggered this 

- random episode of not being able to swallow, triggering intense panic. it purely in my head, it like i forget how to swallow. 

- random episode of intense panic at restaurant usually when i take the first bite or 2 of food. i get dizzy and my heart start racing and i feel trapped or something - i really cant explain it. usually fade within minute and im fine. 

- ive gone through a few phase of this (thank god it not happening now) but sometimes when im right on the verge of falling asleep, like that stage where you sometimes feel like your falling and it jolt you awake, my heart feel like it fluttering (like a heart palpitation) followed by intense hard beating and i cant breathe. the inability to breathe/taking huge deep breath go on cycle after cycle of this. there were many night i didnt sleep at all. this usually would go on for week and then stop. if i take lorazepam it stops. 

im really struggling to find a doctor that will take these situation seriously",anxiety

but i also gave up long before i would even try these new subject

1437,"hello, i am assuming a majority of you will not read this so basically i have a fear of dying because doctor technically dont know what is wrong with me and im constantly sick. please send word of encouragement.

whole story:
i am a 16 year old girl who ha recently developed health anxiety after having anxiety for 8 years. i developed health anxiety after experiencing some pretty bad chest pain and skipped heart beats. it felt like i wa dying and they would give me panic attacks. i would call my mom at 3am every single night and tell her that i wa dying and that i needed help. everyone told me that it wa just the anxiety and i had nothing to worry about. i ended up getting a heart monitor for a week and it confirmed that i wa having skipped heart beat and sometimes even triple skipped heart beats. it is apparently very normal and not a cause for concern. they said the only reason i could feel them wa because i had a rib that wa inflamed. i wa doing a lot better after that and i wasnt feeling anxious about my health. then i got a really bad infection in october and i almost went septic. after that infection i had bout of high heart rate and blood pressure. my heart rate would be resting at 130 when i wa sitting. i would constantly feel like i wa going to pas out. i wa sitting down in class and all of a sudden i felt my vision going out and i told my teacher i needed help. my classmate were super helpful and i felt really thankful for them. they cleared the chair out of the way and they helped me into a wheelchair when the nurse came. my mom took me to the hospital and my heart rate came down with iv fluid so they sent me home and said i wa probably dehydrated. four more hospital visit later with chest pain, presyncope, high rate rate and they still dont know what is going on. i ended up getting pink eye one day so my grandma took me to the hospital and i got prescribed med and i went home. i had a bowl of chili, a bowl of soup, and half a sandwich with my grandma. my grandma left and about 20 minute later i called 911 on myself. all of a sudden my head wa burning like my whole brain felt like it wa on fire and i wa losing consciousness. i dailed 911 and made sure my door wa unlocked. a local volunteer showed up and said my oxygen level were low. i wa hooked up to oxygen and profusely shaking by the time the ambulance arrived. my mom wa cry and obviously worried because i had been sick for a while now and im sure she thought i wa finally dying this time. i wa in the ambulance where i had a sustained heart rate of 140 which actually isnt bad compared to the heart rate i get now. the doctor sent me home after doing chest x-rays, treponin and d-dimer test, and multiple ecgs. i got a referral to a cardiologist and he told me it wa anxiety. they tried doing orthostatic blood pressure but i almost passed out while i wa laying down so they stopped and immediately called in people to take a manual heart rate and blood pressure. my heart rate wa 130 and my blood pressure wa 160/89. i would like to note that my blood pressure and heart rate are not consistently that high. i wa feeling better after getting some water and a cold wash cloth. they put another heart monitor on me after that happened. i wa sent down to do a urine test and while getting off the elevator i dropped to the ground and told my mom that i didnt feel well. the wonderful lady working in the lab immediately rushed over and lifted me into a room. they hugged me and my mom and told me that i would be okay. i cried. that wa the most comforting thing i couldve ever been told in that moment especially because i genuinely thought i wasnt going to be alive much longer. i felt so comforted and i dont think ill ever forget those two a long a i live. i wa sent home after doing lab and wa still experiencing episode of almost fainting. about a week later i ended up going to the hospital because my heart rate wa 130 while sitting in school resting and i felt sick. the doctor noticed that i had already been to the hospital many time and that i responded very well to iv fluids. he decided to wait an hour and see if my heart rate would go down and it didnt so i wa prescribed a beta blocker. three day after that i went back to the hospital because i felt like i wa going to be dead any minute. i wasnt drinking or eating very well and i had presyncope three time in a row. my mom drove me to the hospital and it turn out i had the flu and i wa allowed to stop taking the beta blocker(metoprolol suck butthole). they did agree that my heart rate and presyncope episode were highly concerning and made me a special referral to get an echocardiogram.  got my echocardiogram and everything wa normal and i had a talk with a different cardiologist after. she heard my symptom and immediately said that i have some form of dysautonomia. i wa doing pretty good for a couple day now that i knew how to manage symptoms. then i got vertigo from the flu. i currently still have vertigo and it is not fun. i am convinced that i will not wake up one morning. my heart rate today wa very high and wouldnt go down even after drinking lot of water. i am now super nervous that i have pneumonia because i cant stop coughing and i am constantly short of breath. i have been sick 7 time now since august and i am worried that my body wont be able to handle another sickness. i am strong but i dont know how much more i can take.",anxiety

1450,"for a long a i can remember, i've had issue of panic-y episodes. like something will throw me off and it'll set off a fire alarm in my brain and then suddenly i can't think at all. 

my spanish teacher this year happens to push all my buttons. like, she's unpredictable and super subjective about everything, and seems to be completely oblivious to the confusion every kid in her class ha every single day. i've had more issue in her class than every other class this year combined, and today i had my first real incident in like... 2 years, probably. 

basically, we had a timed speaking evaluation where we took a 2 minute video of ourselves answering a question. we had a long list of vocab word we also needed to use, and the whole thing had an actual timer. oh, and every person took the video simultaneously in the same room.

so basically, once i got to almost starting the assignment, the stupid alarm in my head decided to go off, and i ended up just sitting there saying ""oh my god oh my god"" over and over again, unable to start. the teacher came over and wa like ""it's gonna be fine blah blah blah"" which really pissed me off more than anything, because that crazy b**** is the last person i want to be around while trying to maintain sanity.

it's weird though, cause like, i don't feel much genuine fear, you know. it's like i'm trapped in my own head and somebody else is pulling the alarm, and it's just so loud that i can't think anything cohesive and just break down. but like, i understand it isn't rational, which is why it get so tiring that every. single. time. somebody ha to go over and tell me that everything's fine and blah blah blah. like i get they're trying to help, but after hearing that hundred of time my whole life it get tiring because i know. but my fucking head want to fuck with me for some goddamn reason.

1453,"hey all! so about 2 1/2 week ago i started having chest pain, shortness of breath, and feeling like my heart wa about to beat out of my chest and i ended up having a panic attack later that night. since then my physical symptom havent gone away for the most part. there been maybe 3 or 4 day where i felt normal. im seeing a doctor on the 27th but im starting to get worried this is just more than anxiety (which is causing me to feel more anxious lol). im 24 and struggled with anxiety my whole life but never had episode last this long. ha anyone else dealt with this stuff for this long?",anxiety
1454,"this feel like such a silly thing to be afraid of, but i am. i've always been very phobic of vomiting, and gagging is included in that. when i wa 7 or 8, i used to get so anxious before school that i'd gag. that stopped, and then it started again in high school before sport games. i quit, and then i didn't gag (or throw up) for a good 5 or so years. 

in july, it finally happened again. i wa 1,000 mile away from home in the middle of a crowded bar. i panicked and gagged. it didn't happen again for a couple of week until i got in a fight with my boyfriend and gagged uncontrollably while i wa driving (had to pull over a couple of time and turn around to go home - easily had the worst panic attack i've had in years, i wa scream-crying and just wanted to be home). after that, it happened pretty much every other day for 4 weeks. any time i got anxious i'd gag uncontrollably. i gagged in the er, i gagged in a doctor appointment, i gagged while i wa driving, i gagged while someone else wa driving, i gagged in the shower, i gagged in my own bed. suddenly none of my safe place were safe anymore.

i haven't gagged in 4 months. however, i live in constant fear of it happening again. i can't drive in peace, i can't sleep in peace, i work in healthcare with patient talking all day and can't do that without worrying about gagging the whole time, i haven't stepped foot in a bar since the summer, anywhere crowded that i cannot escape in le than a minute (to my car or home) is a no-go. i can't even go to the gym without feeling like i'll gag and end up leaving after 20 minutes. i used to be incredibly social and active. now every single thing i do is dictated by how likely it is to make me gag and how bad it'd be if i gagged in a certain place or event. the best i can do right now is work from home (my job is allowing this temporarily), drive 3 hour back and forth between my city and my parent house, occasionally hang out with my friend in controlled setting (in a house or small cafe/restaurant). 

i deal with extreme throat tightness and a gag-like feeling almost every day. it interferes with my ability to talk, eat, drink, and exercise. i am constantly on edge waiting to gag, but i've been like this for 4 month and haven't. 

i know how irrational that is. i've never thrown up from this gagging but the act terrifies me regardless. i hate having no control over it and i hate the feeling. i'm in therapy already, and i tried meds.

how can i either a) get over it or b) get out of it? it would be one thing if i wa single and just said no thanks, but it is a great point of contention between my husband and i. i have always told him he can go anywhere he plea and stay however long he wants, but i can sense his frustration, especially now that we have a baby and he want u to make memory with our child. when i wa a child myself, we rarely took family vacation and i have plenty of wonderful memory with my family.

i did something i shouldn't have done and googled my symptom to try to ground myself but all i did wa scare myself even more. doe anyone have any tip or advice? i'm 19 and don't have any history with heart problems. i'm mostly concerned about the lethargy accompanied by the arm tightness and random chest pain. thank you!!",anxiety

i just wanted to share this with someone, because it really been bothering me a lot for the past few day now. the day leading up to this date i felt totally fine, but ive been a little on edge ever since. i really like this woman and im scared to death that this feeling is going to happen again on our next date, and i dont want it to ruin a potential relationship.",anxiety

1482,"hi everyone,

30 m here--i've had bout of depersonalization/derealization, major depression and anxiety in the past but i wa always able to get over them by ignoring it or entertaining myself. but over the past year or so i started having panic attacks--not often, but during moment of extreme stress.

early november--i gave myself a major anxiety attack when i started looking up the side effect of a hair loss drug i wa taking called finasteride. some of the side effect were brain fog, erectile dysfunction, high anxiety, suicidal ideation, etc. after the initial anxiety set in, i stopped taking the drug. but in the same week i broke up with my girlfriend of 10 months.

that week leading up to the break-up: extreme dpdr. i could barely tell what wa reality and i spent most of it in bed because i felt so mentally off. after the breakup, some of the anxiety lifted--but for the most part it wa still really bad. week passed and i'm still feeling extremely anxious. the panic attack have gone down since my therapist gave me some coping mechanisms--so even though they come, i've been able to prevent them from manifesting into a full-blown panic attack.

but for the past few weeks, my mind ha been feeling a state of general and constant anxiety/slight panic. it's been centered on the absurd idea that the ground is just going to give way or disappear, or that my apartment is going to flip over, or that the floor is going to curve downwards, or that i'm going to sink through the earth--or occasionally float off into the sky.

it sound absurd--but i can't stop this thought cycle. i should also mention i feel this anxiety (and have always felt it) when i'm going into an elevator or into an airplane.

i don't think i'm schizo or at least i hope not. i am ocd, however. and i've always had these fears--they've just become far more loud in recent weeks.

1483,"(25 f) so yesterday i had a panic attack while driving home from a weekend getaway with my boyfriend. i'm not someone who experience panic attack often. i started having panic attack when i wa around 22 and i would say i experience them 2-3 time a year. the attack first started off a severe tingling in the face, neck, chest, arms, and hands. i. wasn't sure what wa going on, so i started panicking. my hand then started locking up and it wa hard to move my face. i straight-up thought i wa having a stroke. i started freaking out and asking my boyfriend what wa going on with me. he said, ""it look like you're having a panic attack."" 

i honestly didn't think that wa what it wa because i never experienced the tingling with a panic attack before. the one i usually have are just me shaking with an elevated heart rate and fast breathing. he told me to try taking slow deep breaths, but for some reason it make me freak out even more. i asked him if he could drive me to the hospital, but instead, he called up one of our friend who is a paramedic. he asked me what i wa feeling and i told him. he said, ""yep, sound like you're having a panic attack."" he then told me to try this one specific breathing exercise. breathing slowly, deeply, and gently in through the mouth and out through the nose. i started doing that and eventually the tingling and panic went away and i felt back to normal.

today i'm feeling extremely tired, burntout and have still been experiencing mild tingling on and off in my face and neck. my lung also hurt a bit. i ended up calling off work today and basically just slept the entire day. i just want to know if it's normal to feel like this after a panic attack. sorry for the long post but i felt i needed to explain in order for the way i'm feeling now to make sense. thanks!",anxiety

hello, 

i have had anxiety for nearly all my life. and clearly, stress can make it worse. unfortunately i don't really have the type of anxiety that stem from something happening or any bad events. (though sometimes yes thing can trigger it) my brain just put out the chemical at will when it's not necessary. (as told to me by numerous doctor and therapists) 

so i'm constantly trying new thing and i'm on medicine for it. however, i do have my great phase and not so great phases. i can go month with having barely anything. then i go from 1-100 while i'm just sitting there enjoying a movie or drawing. literally anything. 

now, i've been living with my boyfriend for 5 year and we've been together for 6.

now he's starting to tell me i'm borderline bipolar with my anxiety. that i'm needing to be admitted to a hospital for my anxiety because i'll be sitting there all fine and dandy, then i start freaking out for no reason. he's been looking up symptom of psychosis and whatever else. asking me all sort of question about if i hear voice in my head and if i'm seeing things.

which is all hurtful to me because no, i don't have any issue other than anxiety. i'll start freaking out just with the general anxiety feeling out of no where. not that i hear voice or think i see things. i've been looked at enough by many doctor and they've cleared me of everything like that. i just have anxiety pretty bad sometimes....

i'm not sure how to get that through his head. is there any way or any opinion that i can have to get him to listen to me?? he's really beating me down with this and it's making me doubt what i've been told by my doctor's and therapists. even my own parent's don't agree with him. 
i'm so lost.",anxiety
1523,"hi everyone,i need some advice on my addiction to whatsapp. you see my 20 year old daughter left home a few month ago and she probably text me every 2 nd or 3rd day. my issue is that i am constantly checking my phone to see ha a message come through. i could be checking my phone at least 20 time a hour. you see i don't want to miss her text in case it's important,and also i feel if i don't text her back straight away she will gradually stop texting me. i really like getting her text a it put me in a good mood and i'm afraid if i don't reply straight away she will eventually stop and i may only get an occasional text then. i am suffering with bad anxiety now over this. every time i get a message i think it's her. i need some help badly. thank you",anxiety

my team is great and they all say im doing well even though im not hitting my goals. 

has anyone worked at a phone-based job before and seen decrease in anxiety over time? the job is work from home, the benefit and pay are amazing, but i am so anxious all of the time. i want so badly for it to be worth it but i dont know how long to give it before i decide that it just isnt my thing and thats okay.",anxiety
1525," so many people end up being deeply unsatisfied because they choose to live life by doing something that make them bored, that they don't like. which lead to high level of anger, sadness, and frustration.  
this is common in job or in leading business just for the money.  
but also in relationships.

this is happening due to the lack of knowledge of their deepest desires, or about themselves.  
as i said earlier, it is a choice. choice are multiple, they don't resume to a single one. never.

you become able to see other choice available when you become willing to embrace change, transformation, and self-growth.   
from here to actually manifesting what you want get easy.

what you should always have in mind is that somebody else already overcame the problem you have. somebody out there ha already found the solution.

exactly why at this moment there are so many coach and content creator that you can learn from.   
choose what fit your interest best, and trust your gut while doing so.

1571,"hi all,

i've been sick this entire year, and i cannot figure it out. due to rapid weight loss and inability to consume enough food, my doctor said i need to check into the hospital if this doesn't improve within a few weeks.

when i first got sick in january, i wa extremely anxious over a dating situation that didn't workout. this seemed to flare-up extreme symptom (vomiting and inability to eat). i have had social anxiety that i thought i had gotten over around 2019, a i became very confident and made many new friends, but this incident seemed to bring it back full force.

i thought the anxiety started to get under control over the spring, or wa at least manageable to the point where i should no longer be perpetually extremely sick. i wa diagnosed with celiac disease in july, which seemed to be the answer.

now, here i am several month later and i've gotten worse with no clear outside stressor. the following symptom are present:

-perpetual nausea, all felt where the stomach is located

-vomiting

-poor appetite. when i'm not feeling well, i cant even hold down water.

there are more, all stomach discomfort related.

my gi can't figure it out a i shouldn't be this sick from celiac anymore, and suggested it could be anxiety and i ""may not even realize it."" the symptom are relentless and i get virtually no relief. it's been debilitating for month where i can barely leave the house due to nausea. the thing is, i want to go out and do things, but physically am too sick.

i do notice that i often feel ""on edge,"" so i know a general and perpetual anxiety disorder may be the issue.

has anyone had extremely debilitating nausea issue on a daily basis for this long? 

despite possible anxiety, i can still function for work and am not by any stretch psychologically debilitated. my mind is a bit cluttered, but if it's anxiety, it seems to be more ""subconscious.""

i've also tried therapy, meditation, endless natural supplements, aromatherapy, and yet nothing seems to help the nausea. 

i don't want to start the ssri route unless i'm 99% sure i'm sick from anxiety and nothing else, a that's a rabbit hole and take a long time to start working.",anxiety

1573,"greetings, im 16 and i have severe anxiety since the summer 2022.

everytime, i ask myself if i did something wrong.

for example : i have been with my girlfriend for 5 month and even if alls good, post about cheat gaves me anxiety. i have been in depression for 5 month from november to march 2022. 
during my depression i got a lot of panic attack due to my exfriends. when i am with girlfriend alls good but the moment i leave her make me wanna cry but not because im not with her but because i start overthinking. it been the same for school, i ask myself if i still want to continue the high school. im bored of school. my doctor told me to go visit a psy but i declined due to money and time. he gave me tercian. it is a medication which make me sleep instead of fight my anxiety. i think i just need to live with my anxiety and let my mind tolerate it.",anxiety
1574,"a few day back, i went to a psychologist for the first time, and she said that i have anxiety, but not like, up and downs, but i'm constantly anxious, she didn't said it like this, this is how i can explain with my own words. this explains a lot of things, i don't know anything about psychology and mental health and shes helping me a lot. i just wanted to tell someone this, since i dont have anyone to talk about those kind of things.",anxiety
1575," so i'm in my early thirty having a proper adult relationship for the first time in my life. i'm discovering a whole bunch of new thing about myself i never actually knew about or wa aware existed until now.

so i met this guy online and pretty much we've been straight with each other since day one. at some point i developed feeling and we progressed towards having exclusivity and a relationship (everything ha been mutual and nothing force upon). but we are talking thing slowly. so far so good...

so all in all we know each other 6 month and of course a bit of ups and down (on my site). now day i've been having severe anxiety about this relationship. i'm overthinking about situation that (at least now) are far from reality. my mind go something like this.

**scenario 1**

today he's not talking much therefore most likely his losing interest. bare in mind that it may so be that the past 2-3 day we would be together being all lovely and stuff. it's like my brain invalidates all the lovely moment and hang on to that one day that for whatever reason it off (i.e busy day or not in the mood or anything else)

**scenario 2**

today we spoke a lot and we showed affection to each other (which i love so much ) but feel like the expectation bar is raised. and that if the next day is something lesser my mind go overdrive and ...well you get the point

**scenario 3**

today we spoke a lot and showed affection to each other but there's nothing more to talk about. although my logical part of the brain say ""dude this is normal, you've been speaking to each other non-stop for 6 month there will come a moment where there's nothing to say"" the illogical part (the emotional one) of the brain is overwhelmed with negative thought of the type ""ok probably it's the beginning of the end""

**scenario 4**

if there's a day i might feel a bit off about my feeling for him again my brain understand that it could happen. but still i'm overwhelmed by stress and anxiety that i might be losing interest (although i know it not the case).

or what if this relationship turn into a friendship? i'm struggling to understand how some relationship of year end up like that and that in it own thing will induce intrusive thought and anxiety. i do understand that thing will subside with time but i don't wanna lose that **""god you are so cute""** feeling i get more often than not. i do understand that not all day will be like that but i'm scared that **all days** will be like that at some point. it feel a if this inevitable doom is lurking that for some come sooner and for others later and that no one is immune to it.

i also have to mention that **nothing absolutely nothing** is wrong so far in my relationship. we are still getting to know each other (there a lot of aspect of him i don't know and vice versa) and if i could say anything i feel that it getting stronger. we are intimate ,we communicate fairly well (i told him i'm an anxious person with insecurity and i'm working on them in order not to burden him. we also establish like an ""us time"" where we could talk about our emotion and feeling and see where we stand. even that stress me out a i'm always thinking that he will get fed of me because of that), we respect each other personal space , working hour , independent lives. we even kissed publicly (both of u are bisexual and discreet)

for the first time in my life i feel the need to go public. let my friend know about him. but again my mind stress me out not because of coming out of the closet (i really don't care ab that) but because it try to undermine the reality of this relationship. like it telling me **maybe** they are 1-2 red flag (although there are 10 green flags) so.... go get stressed about it.

now , before you say i'm fucked up (i already know this ) i would like to thank in advance for the responses. any advice on how to ease up and enjoy this relationship would highly be appreciated. i honestly do feel that it could be the beginning of something serious but even if it not i would like it to be of other reason and not my anxiety fucking thing up all the time.",anxiety

i am a first year phd student and in a day i will be giving my first lecture ever. it is a one time thing, it will be held in remote and will last several hours. i am absolutely terrified.  

i have done my best to prepare. i have repeated the whole lecture like three times. however, i am always a mess during presentations, and it's one of the reason i want to leave academia once i get my phd.  i always get super anxious, my mouth get dry which make it super hard to talk, and it's like i completely forget the speech i had prepared. 

i think in part it's because i feel that what i'm explaining is too easy and dumb, and i cannot express myself that well. besides, i wa basically forced to give this lecture. it's about a topic i hate and don't know too much about, which only make thing worse. the student are basically my age and it's likely they know more than me about the topic.

1592,"today wa one of the worst day of my life. not only because of what happened, but because i am so helpless to preventing it. a you can probably tell from the title, i'm still trying to figure out what went wrong and i can't help but feel like my life and mental state is falling apart.

i guess i should explain what agoraphobia is. from what i've researched, it's basically the fear of being in situation that you can't easily get out of, or being in a situation where you might become embarrassed easily, etc. i have struggled with this for a while ever since i wa in middle school and it really fucking sucks. 

this fear ha consumed my life. i make up excuse to friend and family in order to avoid public place such a restaurants, stores, pretty much anything that involves going to a public place around other people where i can't easily get out of without raising suspicion. for example, with restaurants, i feel extremely uncomfortable around people in public places. it make it even worse when you are forced to sit and wait for your food and for your check, so when you feel a panic attack coming on, you can't just get up and leave. just thinking about this make my anxiety spike before even arriving there, making a panic attack much more likely.

so today i tried working on that by going out with family. i wa able to ""survive"" the restaurant by drinking a bit of alcohol (i'm in my mid 20's btw) and staring at my phone trying to do anything to keep my mind off the fact that i could have a panic attack in front of a packed restaurant.

the problem started after leaving the restaurant. i wa already anxious and once i got back to a family member's house to socialize, that's when it happened. i don't even know how to explain it but i know for 100% that it wa a panic attack. i felt light headed at first and my face went red. by the time i reached the bathroom my heart wa racing extremely fast. i fell to the bathroom floor in front of the toilet in case i had to get sick, but i felt frozen in place. i could feel my heart racing across my whole body. my hand were shaking uncontrollably. i felt like i wa having a seizure and a heart attack at the same time. deep breath were not helping at all. my heart rate continued to race even when trying to control my shaky breathing. 

after about  10 minute straight of this happening, i could hear my family talking in the other room and i knew i had to join them or i felt like i wa going to die in that bathroom. i thew water on my face and managed to work up enough courage to open the door and start walking. 

i made it back to them and told them that the drink that i had at the restaurant made me a bit dizzy, but my hand were trembling and my voice sounded like i couldn't talk properly. i knew that they knew something wa up, but while i sat there with them, my heart still wa racing and my hand couldn't hold anything let alone stop shaking.

i had to sit there during one of the most intense panic attack i've ever had and pretend like everything wa alright. it wa one of the scariest moment of my life and i feel like i've been mentally damaged because of it. that is mostly why i am writing this. i feel like the detail are starting to blur and it's becoming harder and harder to remember what happened.

i don't know if anyone else here ha ever experienced something a intense a this, but i don't think i can make it through another one of these panic attacks. especially now after that one, i'm worried that it will either get worse, or happen more frequently. 

can anyone please share anything that you do to help prevent or to control panic attacks. i'm not on any medicine and i don't even drink (the 2 drink at the restaurant were the first drink i've had all year). i don't know what's wrong, but i really need to figure it because each day i feel like i have le and le control over my body.

 feeling like i have a fever even though i feel normal temp/even a little cold to the touch- sometimes even having a small fever but the rest of my body feel like a normal temp

 racing heartbeat/or heart palpitation 

 fast and shallow breathing

 ice cold hands/or feet- my body feel hot but either my hands/or foot feel like theyre freezing

 ear feel like theyre hot/sometimes feeling like theyre burning(specifically my right ear)

 cold/burning sensation in my chest

 depressive episodes

 excessive worry and cant think about anything else than what im feeling, then the feeling get worse/fester the more i think about it

these symptom kinda happen in combination for me. if that make sense? it definitely depends on what triggered the anxiety. sometimes i dont even need a reason for it to go off, like ill just be sitting and relaxing and then itll strike out if nowhere. 
here are thing that i do to help relieve the anxiety at home or if im out in public.

at home: watching a comfort show, deep breathing, talking to others about it, cbd oil roller(or some type of calming roller), drinking small sip of water, drawing/or being creative somehow, drinking ginger tea, journaling, etc stuff like that.

in public: deep breathing(this is a big one for me), taking break by going outside or to the bathroom to collect myself, comforting myself by telling myself that ill be going home soon, cbd/calming roller, constantly reassuring myself that im not actually sick, etc.

i know people have different symptom and different technique of helping themselves, but these are just some of mine. hopefully this will help some people or relate to others:)",anxiety

to summerize, i'm a content creator and i do challenge in video games. i had an awful experience with setting up rule in a challenge in pokemon and this is how it went:

basically, i'm doing a no heal run, one enemy (chansey) healed me, i wa like ""uhm this must be against the rules? i mean i got healed"" then i said welp i'm discarding the gyrados (pokemon that got healed). then i got a new one and went for a gym. the gym got a misdreavus who did pain split and it healed my pokemon. i said nah i'm not allowing this and change the rule to how it was, so basically ""i"" can't heal run.

first i thought enemy heals wa against the run, then i change it back and said nah it's not.

i only got heals from the enemy which i realized, after changing the rule to it doesnt matter if the enemy heals me, it against the rule and then after it happened again i said you know what, it actually not against the rules. enemy heals is ok

thats what im saying, like is it okey to change rule like this? like going back and forth? i said it against the rules, happened again and then i changed my mind to saying it not against the rule lol

my mind think if i continue this run i'm a liar, i'm going to have anxiety forever if i post this on youtube, i'm a cheater, etc. when in reality i think it's fair if i get healed from the enemy since it's not in my control. it's all because i made up a rule and changed my mind discarding that rule to the challenge.

1662,"this is a vent cause my anxiety is building
up but ill try to sum it up cause i at least what some sort of response.

a lot happened this year and i dont get along with my family since a very young age and this year made me really want to get away from them and i wish i could move out on my own but i cant afford it and im scared of even attempting and end up losing my job and losing everything. especially having to get rid of my dog or leaving her here.

skip to the situation now. never gotten along with my sister cause shes always gotten her and she throw a fit when she get told no or just hold a grudge. it always been this way since shes the only girl in the family.

i mentioned i have a dog and recently she asked me if i wa okay with her getting a cat cause my mom already gave her the green light.  why bother asking if my mom already said yes? also she already bought pee pad prior to even asking me and after i gave her my opinion she say the cat might come home a early a sunday (today, conversation wa friday)

so my opinion didnt matter. her intention were already set to bring the cat home before asking me. 

ive tried training my dog for the longest and my sister would always ruin it by thinking she can have the dog do what i taught her like having her off the leash outside without her run away. it wa never 100% locked in. 

i walk my dog over to the grass on the sidewalk, she let her run out the door and then my dog run away and i usually always catch her walking back into the house to get her shoe instead of going after her which i always end up having to drive around looking for her. 

also a few month ago, my dog got attacked by another dog cause she took my dog out for a walk somewhere she shouldnt have and ive told her countless time which way to go but she never listens to my instructions. thats one thing that turned into a huge traumatic thing for me this year.

she said she want me to help train my dog to get along with the cat. she said shed do it herself also but i dont trust her. i never said yes to anything.

i asked her if she did her research and she said no. so shes just winging it and i told her about the cat cant be stuck in the room all day and since the cat not trained it going to be all over the place and peeing and pooping everywhere. 

today i walked by the area i have a pee pad incase my dog need to go at night and she literally ha a stupid cardboard box with a pee pad inside. cat pee/poo odor is very strong and can contain parasite regardless of vaccinations. 

she didnt prepare anything, not even a sleeping arrangement for the cat.

im stressed out of my mind cause i cant say anything without being the bad guy and yes sometimes you have to be the bad guy but my mom always back her up and i always end up feeling like shit and my mom enforces by the way she act and giving me demand just to irritate me and my sister walk around with that grudge like i ruin everything.

as i wa typing this. the cat is now home.
i only see thing going south from here. i dont want to confront her about her irresponsibility cause it just going to turn into an argument.",anxiety
1663,"i haven't really talked to my best friend in months, and when i have lately it's been short conversation at most. i'm not blaming them by any means, i get it. they have a ton of other things/people to deal with that are important, completely understandable. but i miss them, and they're quite literally the only irl friend i have and am too anxious to reach out to them. partly in fear that i don't want to bother them, or that they won't respond. part of me want them to forget about me, why am i like this ffs.

i think, since 2019, if i remember it right, i started getting these heart palpitations, it always feel like my heart just skipped a beat and jumped off my chest for a second.  
now that i think about it, i remember some time before i started getting these palpitations, i had some mini panic attack thinking i wa gonna have a stroke, i'd quickly stand up because i felt a vibration in my head, this in particular, led me to ask my mom to go to the hospital to get me checked, i wa 17-18 at the time, they said nothing wa wrong with me, yet i went there twice, because i wa still anxious.

i kept having these after that, they'd happen like once a month, or even once every 3 months, but i think gradually i started having them more often.

eventually i went to see a cardiologyst, i did all the test he asked: ekg, ecg, spent a 24 hour with a holter monitor, i missed the thyroid test unfortunaley. but anyways, he said nothing wa wrong with me, i just needed to go out and exercise more, i am a very sedentary person, but also thin a hell.

then after this, i wa sure my problem wa just anxiety. annnd, i did nothing about it. i did not start exercising and i did not start therapy, too expensive.

after a year or so, this particular day in september, i had a usual heart palpitation, didn't care, i got used to it i guess, but then, right after that, i bent down to grab something i dropped, and when i got up, my heart wa suddenly at 180bpm or more. i immediately ran to my sister and asked her to take me to emergency, this had never happened to me before, i thought i wa going to die honestly, i dindn't - or at least, don't remember- feeling any other odd stuff happen to my me, it wasn't hard to breathe, i could talk and walk, in fact i stayed very calm, even cracking joke with the nurse before they put me bed at icu. i think by the time i got there my heart calmed down a little. anyways, they gave me a shot of something that made my heart get back to normal, i spent a whole night there, and by morning i wa set to go home.

after this day, i'm having heart palpitation way more often, and because of this, my anxiety is making my life hell, i live in constant fear of a heart attack, or having to experience that again.

i just don't understand, my test showed my heart wa okay, i got used to heart palpitation once in a while but this, this wa terrifying... and i just can't get myself to believe this is just anxiety... is it possible for anxiety to cause this, out of nowhere??? even though i wasn't even feeling anxious that day... that's just... i don't get it....",anxiety

i am a 30 year old man and suffer from gad and panic disorder since being diagnosed in 2011. my life ha been up and down with anxiety over the last decade. i had my last big battle with anxiety when i attempted to move to north carolina for school. i lasted one week. the panic attack were so bad that i just could not be away from my home in the midwest. so i did what i do best... i flee the fear. since that time i returned to school and am now at a point in my life where i must get a job. 

so i applied to and got a job in maryland. the job seems fitted for me in most aspects. i should be excited about this new adventure but no. the night after i accepted the job, i had my first panic attack in 6 years. i wake up now with anxiety and physical symptom (e.g., racing heart and thoughts). i catastrophize something terrible. in short, i am a mess. i just want to be happy but that is too much to ask for apparently. 

so my question for all you good people who have moved for work is this: how did you calm you anxiety in the lead up to the move? any tip or suggestion to resting my brain and heart? story you want to share?

hello, all! this is a new account because i deleted the other one to avoid compulsion but i really need advice. four year ago i suffered from derealization and through help of the dp manual i wa able to recover! three beautiful year of no anxiety or ocd thoughts. now, im the last six month ive struggled with harm/fear of psychosis ocd. 

ive read, listened, and watched everything to understand that recovery is done with acceptance through erp (exposure response prevention.) i honestly understand it and know the process but i cant find the drive or next big step to accepting.

my main fear is going crazy, being a psychopath and fear im going to hurt my loved ones. so i really take it slow on my coffee and drinking now. i constantly talk to myself mentally and look for my anxiety and ocd feelings. now with derealization again  and trying to stop the thoughts.

im an average guy, like to drink my beer three to four day a week, my girlfriend and i love craft beer and new breweries! have my morning cup of coffee. work out do to five day a week and go to work and starting school again to get certified a a chef! i dont let the ocd or anxiety stop me from my everyday stuff but it a burden to carry this with me, it a constant shadow im always thinking about during my white noise time of the day.

with my therapist we are doing erp. so shes telling me to have my coffee, go out and drink with friends, and try to sit with my fear and accept that i cant control if any of them come true. i try to just live my life and accept my anxious feeling but it feel they never go away and im constantly double checking myself. 

ill drink with my girlfriend on the weekend and when anxious say it just because you trained yourself to be scared but then want to go sober till i fix myself. thought like this happen a lot, same like coffee or trying to not stop thinking about the thoughts.

hey! ok, i ask you to read below and try to put yourself in my situation.

2021-04-13:
long story short. had been suffering from a long-lasting cough (5-6 weeks) and sought care. the doctor heard something on the left lung and sent me for an urgent x-ray the same day.  i wa terrified and thought i had lung cancer.  i wa nervous and scared to death until i got my test result back.  it showed nothing but i recovered a few day later.

2021-09-14:
my wife found a liver spot/mole on my back that looked weird. this after i had complained of itching in that place 1-2 month earlier. thought it wa skin cancer and wa nervous and scared to death for several week before i received an answer that there wa no danger. the mole didn't look ""bad"" so they didn't do anything about it.

2021-10-07:
my wife find a lump on the right shoulder blade, size approx. 1x1 cm. it can be moved but feel strange somehow.  immediately becomes completely convinced that this is also a cancerous tumor.  either the skin cancer ha spread or it is a sarcoma (soft tissue cancer that can feel exactly like a fatty lump). once again, i became very nervous, stressed and scared to death. i sought care and wa able to see a reputable doctor who informed me that it wa a lipoma. when he wa about to take it away, he say he can't find it.  i imagined he saw it and it wasn't a lipoma.  he said something to the other doctor and i didn't really understand where.  he you catch me again and the lump is still there.  instead, he sends me for an urgent mr x-ray and here i am completely destroyed.  i take him a if he ha seen something that make him not dare to cut me.  i lie at home and shake for several day and have such fear of death that it is completely sick. i end up trying to go into that x-ray tunnel but it doesn't work. try 3-4 time but i just lie there and cry because i'm afraid of what the x-ray will show.  here i am completely convinced that it is cancer of some kind.  i had to cancel everything and today the lump is still there.  the doctor called me 3 week later and said he wa 100% sure it wa a lipoma and that it can stay on my body without doing any harm. so, i still have it and i'm alive.

during this course of ""diseases"" i get hemorrhoid and start having stomach problems.  i still have huge problem with my stomach (heartburn, acid regurgitation, irregular stools, stomach pain, stomach cramps, etc.).

i'm simply wondering if this could be the result of some kind of stress, nervousness, panic disorder, death anxiety over an extended period of time?

note: i have never before had ""problems"" with my stomach (that i know of) but after the above event it is in total revolt.

please write a line or two what you think.

in the moment when i lit up a candle in my room, put on some calm music and try to just enjoy the moment, i just can't. the inner tension that keep me going is there all the time. it's the most noticeable when i'm not active. the moment before i get up from bed it's the worst. physical painful tension in my chest and sometimes even racing thoughts. i'm thinking all the time about how i should have stable job already. that i don't look good enough so i should excercise more. my band is not progressing fast enough. i'm not enough, no matter what i do. i have big ambition in life, but everytime i am not working on them or not seeing any progress i just spiral down into hopelessness.

i know, that progress is never that fast. that i should be more kind to myself and i am trying. but the physical tension i feel is so uncomfortable. i feel mentally drained, i just want to rest, but i don't know how. my mind is only seeing thing i could improve and until then i can't relax. doe anyone know, what could help? i'm already in therapy, but maybe someone could have some experience with this.",anxiety

ive suffered with anxiety my whole life, it wa worse when i wa a teen, got better previous years, now im in my 20 and it at an all time high. im a pretty responsible person, im a manager at a retail store, i always show up, i pay my bill on time, etc. about 6 month ago the cashier i worked with at night showed me these energy pill that made me feel like i wa on opiates, but they were completely legal to buy where im from, so i didnt think anything of it. the pill completely obliterated my anxiety and depression, made me motivated, i wa more sociable and just generally happy on them. i ended up taking them pretty much multiple time a day for 6 months, spent an insane amount of money on them, and had to borrow money from people to pay my bill and eat. about 2 week ago, i found out that they were a combination of a tricyclic antidepressant/anxiolytic called tianeptine. once i found out i quit taking them, i experienced insane withdrawal and im finally starting to feel a little normal. however, since stopping them, my anxiety is like never before. im constantly thinking about the worst possible thing happening to me, im nauseated and sweaty all of the time, i feel like im walking around naked and exposed. it feel like everyone is judging everything about me. i feel gross and gluttonous. im really uncomfortable in my house and outside my house, i just feel like everyone can see me naked and i hate it. nothing feel real and i just wanna leave my body. ive been waiting 2 week for my psychiatrist to reach back out to me. if anyone ha tip to cope in the meantime please let me know.",anxiety

fast forward to now, i havent taken anything since september, my anxiety + depression is starting to get unmanageable again and it really starting to interfere with work especially, and life at home (2 young child &amp; a fianc). ive also been losing interest in my hobbies. im an avid runner, planning on running another marathon in the spring, a well a photography. but i just dont feel like doing anything but laying down all day. every single day feel like the biggest task. i also have a stutter that get a lot worse when im anxious. life ha just been so very hard for me and i just do not know what to do anymore. 

after i got off prozac i finally wa able to get an appointment with a psych (was on the waitlist for over 6 months), who suggested i try zoloft. i got the script but never picked it up. i know zoloft is in the same ssri class a lexapro &amp; prozac and i have been scared to try another med. my anxiety skyrocketed the first few week when trying lex &amp; prozac and im not sure if i have the willpower to fight thru that for the 3rd time just to find out another med doesnt work. will anything help my anxiety? i feel so hopeless it hard to even put it in word how ive been feeling, but i know that i need help.

so, panic that i immediately scanned the file, and although the file seems to be safe, meaning that no malicious detection ha been detected by antivirus vendors, still i am worried shit about that php file may spread some very dangerous thing all over my iphone, icloud, and ton of the negative thought flooded back all at once.

for me, staying consistent at something feel almost impossible. in some period my anxiety basically just numbs me to the point where i'm paralyzed and i simply can't do anything other than the bare minimum such a getting up in the morning, eating, binging yt video (the only thing i can sometimes do that make me kind of happy) and showering. during these time my brain just doesn't allow me to read, write, study, watch a movie or do pretty much anything i enjoy and love. 

when i wa still studying at uni, i had a pretty consistent routine where i used to read at least 10 minute every day, which would usually turn out being at least half an hour a day, and it wa amazing, i've managed to read so many book over the course of like a year and a half. now i've been in an anxious/depressed episode for a few month and i completely stopped reading. my brain just can't, i feel so overwhelmed at the thought of even starting to read again, a if something bad is gonna happen if i return to it. honestly, this is so tiring that i get burnt out by not doing it. 

  
do you guy have any tip on how to keep a routine even when you enter an emotionally low period? because i don't want to keep on losing each one of my interest that it took me month and month to cultivate. this is so demotivating, because each time i start a habit, chance are i'm likely loosing it when my anxiety hits. at the moment i really want to start reading again and i'd like to buy a bullet journal and try to journal and plan my days, a well. however, not only am i overwhelmed with the thought of starting to read again, but the whole idea of making a routine for myself that i could lay out in a bullet journal sound like i'm constraining my time and day - which is wrong and i'm aware of it, but my anxiety is like: if you make yourself do this and that for this much time each day you're restricting yourself and possibly robbing yourself of some new and spontaneous experience that could happen daily. this is so, so, rigid and stupid but i can't get through this mindset but i would really love to try planning and journaling a i'm aware that these would help me deal with anxiety. i'm sorry if this if all over the place, i just wanted to give some broader context to my situation.",anxiety

then one day in class in like november 2021 i wa sitting down and got this really weird feeling in my head, it felt like wind just went in circle up there. very surprised i didnt jump up out my seat but it made me feel bad and very anxious , i went to my next class and felt awful, i could barley talk and that wa the first of many time i called my mom to come get me from school. i took a nap at home and felt better. 

i think it wa in december of 2021 i started to get this weird feeling in my stomach after eating it wa like a pulsing sensation(i now think it my hr that increases) and it a very awful feeling. i just put it off because it would come and go up but this summer it just got worse. every time i would eat i would my hr would increase it made me feel awful. it would always calm down but on it own, there wa nothing i could do to stop it. the only thing that helped wa laying my back against something or eating while im not anxious/stressed. 

some point after that head thing happened while in school or any place that ha bright light i feel like a ghost , really bad derealization every step i took or if i sat down i would feel like im trembling even though my body feel fine, it something in my eye like my vision, i wear my glass now they barley help. i had a awful day at walmart a few day ago i walked in just felt very floaty like and had to basically run out the store, the intensity of everyone staring at me and me being far from the door and then me finally getting to the door made my hr go up and i thought i would pas out, i didnt i went outside in the cold and waited till my mom came. i felt fine in the car.

people are saying it my vagus nerve but i dont know what that is. it make me depressed cause i cant go school i feel very anxious and out of touch, it make me depressed knowing life isnt supposed to be painful and dreadful yet here i am. i cant even eat or go outside without feeling awful. i had a ekg in april 2021 and the july of 2021. everything wa fine. my body feel fine but in public my eye get very like crossed it like that feeling you get when you day dream.

i (23f) have had generalized anxiety disorder my entire life, and i wa diagnosed with it around the age of six. my anxiety ha affected me differently throughout the years, but by the time i reached the age of 18, my body started handling it in a way ive never experienced before: nausea. my motion sickness problem also started worsening around that age too, so i dont believe it a coincidence.
nausea would only come after a buildup of stress, whether positive or negative. there were time where id get too excited or giddy over something, then id wake up feeling ill the next morning. other time involved negative situation that would build up to the point where id wake up every morning feeling ill and not wanting to eat anything. it beginning to feel like i cant go through any extreme emotion anymore without wanting to throw up constantly, and it ruining my life. i get the impression that it only going to worsen a i continue further into adulthood.
i do take medication for anxiety btw, but my tiny body is somehow highly adaptable and i started suspecting my strongest medication isnt a effective on me anymore. im currently experiencing another situation thats bringing me great distress, and the nausea ha been on and off for about two week now. hell, im sick just writing this. i feel so alone because nobody else i know ha this problem, and i would just love some advice from anybody with a similar experience. i just dont know how to tackle this problem anymore",anxiety

1799,"a little backstory: i'm 29f. i've had general anxiety most of my life and wa first diagnosed at 21 - all i ever really experienced wa butterflies, shaking and sweating, and shakey breathing, the expected. when i wa 24, i had a sudden onset of chest pain above the left breast while not experiencing any anxiety; the pain would shoot down my left arm and into my upper abdomen. i went to the hospital and an ecg showed no cardiac events, i wa sent home with the recommendation that it could be musculoskeletal, but i knew this wasn't the case from how it felt.

i had several gp follow ups afterwards, with most doctor agreeing it wa anxiety. i wa prescribed propranolol for a required use, which i still have today. the pain were frequent and daily for the first 6 month after the hospital, and then gradually subsided, and now i hardly get them at all - however, last night, for the first time in years, i had the same experience a the night i went to hospital, and the symptom are worrisome and confusing.

essentially, i had light chest pain in the upper left chest, equidistant between the breast and collarbone; sort of in line with the very bottom of the shoulder. it wa on and off but got more intense after a few hours, and started transferring down the left arm. i took a propranolol but it didn't help at all, so i lay in fear until i eventually fell asleep. this morning i feel right a rain again.

so my question is this: can you have a panic attack that present only in pain and fear of death, but with no difficulty breathing/rapid breathing/changing in heartbeat, and no other outward sign at all? i've always been under the impression that panic attack are quite dramatic and obvious, but i'm hoping that i'm wrong... otherwise i'm not sure what's been happening to me.

i grew up in very strict and conservative family and since i wa born we were visiting one of those fundamental charismatic churches. the faith used to be very important for me, i cared more about what god think of me than if i felt comfortable (actually, le comfortable you feel the better for you). 

one day our church invited a speaker from abroad and said his service is little different. i wa used to see people during church time cry, laugh, expressively clap their hand or fall on floor, etc. all under presence of holy ghost. it wa one of those churches. but this preacher wa on another level. people laugh when he touched them with his finger, some fell on ground and didnt move for minutes/hours. people claimed that nobody stay the same after his service.

i wa always stressed and anxious about those expression because i hate when people acknowledge my existence. but i wa also anxious from the fact that i never fell on the floor a everyone else in a row, so i wa standing there a the only one. and since the faith wa so important for me back then, and those expression were big part our belief i felt like a dirty sinnerbut thats different issue.


i wanted to experience what everyone described on myself. i begged god to help me overcome my own thought and emotion so i can focus on him. then the preacher called everyone in my row  to the front and started to pray for u one by one. a he wa coming closer and closer, i suddenly felt that i could not move my wrist. it wa stuck in one position and it hurt when i wa trying to move. it scared me, i believed i wa paralysed by some demon or something. a i wa panicking i suddenly lost feeling in other hand and slowly my feet. when he came to me, i did fell on ground a i wished but i think it wa bcs of the paralysis. i could not move the part for minutes, the wrist for hours.

i have been going to therapy weekly to every couple week and have seen some improvement in the sense that i am not going to doctor the second i experience something slightly off in my body. unfortunately, i go through phase where i pick up symptom from various medical emergency i am afraid of experiencing, and these phase can last for months. no googling symptom ha been a big rule, and ha helped a well. however i still am experiencing multiple severe panic attack a day and have had nightmare 4-5 night a week for month a well. i avoid alcohol/weed/etc at all cost due to anxiety, so that is not a contributing factor.

1844,"to start off, im 19 m 5'9 150 lbs. i have never had a history of anxiety or depression, or any other conditions, i have been active almost all my life until recent months, in which i haven't been sleeping a well, drinking a much or water, or taking care of myself a much.

&amp;#x200b;

roughly 2 month ago, i smoked weed after drinking a little and not eating. i very rarely smoke, and only have a few time in my life. after smoking, i immediately felt it wasn't right, and sat down on a couch. shortly after, my heart rate began getting faster and faster. this wa until i thought i wa going to have a heart attack, in which it felt a if my heart ""dropped"" after beating very fast and i got sent into a panic alongside many other freak symptom such a slight numbness in my arm. i just rode it out, and got better an hour or so later, so it wa clearly just a panic attack, but i had never had one before. i wa fine the next day and for a few week to come and didn't think anything of it, that is until i would randomly get these 'palpitations' in my heart that would mimic the way my heart felt when i had that attack that night, where it feel my heart skip or stop for a second and my arm feel heavy and then it go back. this only happened once or twice, but the most recent time that it ha happened ha caused me a lot of anxiety. also, i never had any noticeable palpitation that i could remember before that time that i had a panic attack from smoking.

&amp;#x200b;

it happened to me again one day sitting in class. i think this one freaked me out, because after i felt the weird beat, my heart raced and i had mild chest pain and lightheadedness. i tried walking around and drinking water, but it didn't do much. i eventually went to the urgent care and they tested blood sugar, a well a listen to my heart and an ekg, and it all looked good. they referred me to a cardiologist, which i had blood test done, ekg, echo, and a 10 day heart monitor, to which everything came back good. since that most recent ""attack,""

as of recently, i haven't had that ""big"" palpitation again, but i am having minor one that still slightly freak me out, but not a much. i also experience shortness of breath a good amount, but it go away when i distract myself long enough. stress seems to trigger those feeling with my heart a well, and event that trigger adrenaline release, such a swerving to miss a car. i have just been in a constant state of anxiety for over a month now and i have off and on lightheadedness, shortness of breath, fast heart rate exercising, and more.

ive read, listened, and watched everything to understand that recovery is done with acceptance through erp (exposure response prevention.) i honestly understand it and know the process but i cant find the drive or next big step to accepting.

my main fear is going crazy, being a psychopath and fear im going to hurt my loved ones. so i really take it slow on my coffee and drinking now. i constantly talk to myself mentally and look for my anxiety and ocd feelings. now with derealization again  and trying to stop the thoughts.

im an average guy, like to drink my beer three to four day a week, my girlfriend and i love craft beer and new breweries! have my morning cup of coffee. work out do to five day a week and go to work and starting school again to get certified a a chef! i dont let the ocd or anxiety stop me from my everyday stuff but it a burden to carry this with me, it a constant shadow im always thinking about during my white noise time of the day.

with my therapist we are doing erp. so shes telling me to have my coffee, go out and drink with friends, and try to sit with my fear and accept that i cant control if any of them come true. i try to just live my life and accept my anxious feeling but it feel they never go away and im constantly double checking myself.

hey all, 
for context im 17f and yesterday i made the stupid decision to tan in the australian sun (probably 8-9 uv) without any sunscreen for a solid 4 hours. yep i know, absolutely stupid. a expected, around 6pm last night whilst i wa still by the pool with my friend i started shivering and my heart rate wa elevated a well a feeling a little nauseous. i ended up going home and to sleep after applying aloe intermittently. this morning i feel a little better, but pretty damn tired and nauseous (havent vomited tho luckily). the chill have stopped more or le but i still get a bit chilly when i take my cover off. essentially, do you think i need to see a doctor? im quite the hypochondriac and my parent dont think it necessary so maybe i should just ride it out and hydrate etc?

&amp;#x200b;

&gt;i now have a new anxiety trigger: when it start getting dark outside. this is because my panic attack and nausea began when it started getting dark thursday evening.  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;as a result, i had a panic attack last night and another one just now. i breathe too quickly and swallow lot of air, giving me severe stomach pain and making it almost impossible to eat dinner. last night, it took me hour to finish my dinner, a each bite made me feel like throwing up.  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;i need some way to deal with this. this can't be happening every evening. nighttime used to be a much calmer time for me for some reason, possibly because it's unlikely that any anxiety-provoking event will occur compared to daytime.

1896,"hello, been lurking for a little while. hope you all are doing okay :) 

ive been suffering from anxiety since middle school, im 19 now. im in college (i live at home but am transferring to a college that is out of state next year) and have been doing pretty well, however im terrified that when i move away ill get panic attack again. 

for context, when i wa 16 i wa hospitalized for panic attacks, i literally had two 6-8  hour panic attacks. constant throwing up, couldnt keep down any xanax or anything they tried to give me.  complete disassociation, terrible fear- im sure youre all familiar. first i want to know if anyone else ha struggled with really long panic attacks? because whenever i do any research about panic attack i never feel affirmed because it always say they last for a max of 15-30 min which ha been the absolute opposite of my experience. after i wa hospitalized, they figured out which medicine really helped me when i felt the panic coming on really bad and i still use it occasionally. but i do think that the experience of those panic attack definitely ha given me a fair amount of agoraphobia 

as for moving away, im very close with my mom. like if youve seen gilmore girls, were very similar to rory and lorelei lol. basically best friends. and my mom ha been the best support ever and when im having a panic attack she understands exactly what im going through and know what to say- shes my safe person. suffice to say, im terrified of being without her when i have one of these attacks. doe anyone else have these dependency issue and feel like there only one person in the whole world that could help/ understand what youre going through? 

thanks so much for reading and hope youre all well! and let me know if you relate to any of this or have any advice :)

1899,"to all the new comer to anxiety, welcome!  i have suffered from this since i wa in my early 20's till now my 40's.  it come and go in severity, sometimes thing are great and other time thing are terrible.  seems when you are going through a bad spell that it will never end and when thing are good, you sometimes forget how bad it can actually be.  i have tried all kind of life changes, jobs, exercise, meditation, therapy,  medication ( beta blockers, ativan, xanax ( it help but cant get a prescription ), buspar, lexapro, zoloft )  

i have been through all stages, the mental and the physical, it seems a i get older it ha become harder to deal with.  the nail bitting ha never stopped, tapping my feet, shuffling hand while talking, looking all over the place but straight, shortness of breath, rapid heart rate, racing thought that become obsessive and recently numbness.

there ha been so many time in my life i felt a panic attack wa death, i have went and sat at the er parking lot more time that i can count on two hand and two feet.  seems, a my age ha set in i have gotten more and more used to them and when they happen, i do not even have to leave the room anymore, people literally can't even tell i am having a full blown panic attack.  you get good at controlling it after sometime.  i think the problem with this mentality is that holding it all back make it come with full vengeance out in different way that are out of your control.  

just recently i have experience bout of numbness, first it started in my lower jaw, the kind of moved to the whole front of my face, left side of my head and back of my head ( came and went over the day, never stayed more than 30 minute to an hour at a time ).  then i suddenly started feeling it on the front of my shin and feet.  at this point i wa completely freaked out, nothing physical wise from anxiety ha freaked me out in years.  all the panic attacks, shortness of breath rapid heart rates, etc....i would just shrug those off anymore but this really scared the crap out of me..  i initially went to the urgent care because i thought i may be having a stroke or something.  they ran a ct scan on my head to check for brain tumor and found nothing abnormal.  i then saw my regular doctor who told me because of the numbness in my arm / head that i may need to see an orthopedic,  went to er after, they took blood work and ran neurological test on me, found nothing ( no mri ).  about a month later i went to orthopedic he checked my head neck scan and took his own xrays, he found nothing at all.   been waiting month to see a neurologist which is next week.   i feel like i will have an mri done on my neck and head, they will find no sigh's of m and tell me it anxiety related.  which will be a relief and not all at the same time.  thought the numbness ha defiantly subsided over the last month or so, it defiantly is not completely gone.  a week will go by and i will hardly experience it at all, then suddenly i will have it for half a day.  i have been able to deal with basically every other type of physical thing anxiety ha thrown at me but this ha made it extremely hard for me to do my job and plan things.  i never want to be out when it come on extremely strong.

have anyone experience anything like this in their life with extreme anxiety?  when i say numbness, it not so much numb a in your limb fall asleep and you have a hard time moving it.  i'd say it more of the feeling when you stretch really hard and your muscle seems almost relaxed / buzzy.  this seems pleasant but when you are trying to walk / concentrate doing thing and this suddenly come on for 30 minute to an hour it terrible and so hard to focus.  is this just my anxiety coming out in another physical way to show me ""hey, i am still here and i am still going to find a way to make your life a living hell""?  really wish i had some answer a when i tell all the doctor about what i am experiencing they look at me like i am completely nuts.  i am having a full panel of blood work done this coming monday and then the neurologist on friday, maybe i will have some sort of answer.",anxiety

1901,"my anger and jealousy ha become so severe in the last month that it isolating me from everyone. how do i control the outbursts?

to preface this, i have an appointment with a psychiatrist early next month. it wa the earliest appointment i could get in my area at this time, unfortunately.

i wa raised in a family where mental illness is both unspoken about and frowned upon. my mother and great grandmother were both diagnosed bipolar and given treatment, and both eventually stopped it saying it wa all, ""a crock of shit"". 

i have never been to therapy mainly out of embarrassment and shame of how much this ha effected my life. and also the mental illness is horseshit mentality despite me being no contact with anyone in my family for 4.5 year now. literally state away, still effecting me.

i've always had emotional outbursts, but never to this extent the last few months. i'd have an outburst 1-2 a week, but it'd blow over from minute to hour and i'd be normal again. it could be over almost anything. me believing a person wa making fun of me, a chore not being done so me assuming that everyone wanted me to do it, thinking in general that others were out to harm me in anyway. i'd just blow up. scream, sometimes hit thing and myself tho rare then, and then cry after i had more ground.

i'd go to work and i'd usually be normal despite the random outburst. 

i recently got a better job and i work with better people who seem to care about me. i've only been working there for 2 weeks, but it way le stressful than my last job. 

my depression and anxiety have taken a back seat because of the new atmosphere. though i do take an otc anxiety med every morning before work in hope that it'll keep me grounded in case i do get stressed. i also take chateal (birth control) every day to maintain a normal period. those are the only med i'm on rn.  i've kept drinking to a bare minimim to me too for the last few months. so i only drink on saturday whereas i used to drink almost every day heavily in order to maintain the anxiety. i coped through bad mean but i'm trying to do better.

and although the depression and anxiety seems to be doing better, the paranoia ha gotten wayyy worse. i've been paranoid for at least 5 year now. i assume thing and then simply believe them to be true. and usually i can question myself on it and talk myself down without any problem in the outside world. but not anymore.

in this moment i'm me, i'm normal. but in a split second the thought can rotate and i'll fixate, and suddenly i'm hitting walls/screaming/crying/blaming others/etc. 

right now i'm mostly fixating that my friend (who go in before me) got a better position because they're a secretary for our boss. they get to sit all day, i'm on my foot and running around constantly. i'm very upset that i'm not in a better position. but he's already told me to my face that he think i'm smart and is going to try to move me to a better position a soon a the hiring manager give him the thumb up.

they're waiting for the first of next year to start changes. so worst case scenario i'm stuck in a better paying position with nicer people. best case scenario i get moved to another department that pay more than my friend's. 

but i just can't stop fixating. ""why do they get a better job than me?""  ""why am i always so unworthy?""  ""why do they have a better family/job/health than me?""   ""why can't others be nice to me like them?""    

and it doesn't stop there, though that's where most of the anger stem from. the insecurity i'm feeling make me lash out. and i get so mad i just go off. 

other common daily thought i have are....""if i eat at work they'll laugh at me.""  ""if i leave food in the fridge they'll spit in it.""    ""they're laughing at me. i can't hear what they're saying but i know they're making fun of me.""   ""this person who i barely know is going to physically hurt me and i deserve it.""

the spitting in the food paranoia is the most prevalent even when i'm seemingly normal. but yeah, these rotating thought keep going and going, and eventually i'll listen to them and just spiral. i distract myself at work by well, working but when i see the clear office glass and see them...i just get so mad. like the world hate me and love them, and because of that i'll never do any better.

through childhood b i've been emotionally, physically, and sexually abused. they haven't despite them knowing about it. they try to be sympathetic but they don't understand the turmoil it had on me.

i just started really piecing how much it effected me by how quickly i've gotten worse. the paranoia is literally eating me alive. my boyfriend ha to talk me down at least a hour a day and i'm so fucking tired of talking about it. so i know he's tired of talking about it. but i can't seem to talk myself down because it just all feed into itself with the constant noise and overamplified emotions. 

i have to endure this another month until the appoitment. and if i can't then i'm going to the er and requesting them help me, because i'm on my very very last leg.

i can't stop it. i'm always hurting myself in those outbursts. and i'm just exhausted from surviving everyday. 

i always worry if people can tell i'm mentally sick and i try so hard to hide it...i'm worried i'm going to slip in public and won't be able to again. 

does anyone have any idea what i should do with trying to control this? i'm fucking desperate.",anxiety

sorry for the grammatical mistakes, i'm not a native english speaker and i'm just pretty bad at english grammar.   


for the past two year i've had constant anxiety about my heart, i've done all kind of test on my heart like ambulatory ecg/holter monitor, echocardiography, blood tests, stress tests, etc. all of them indicate that i have a normal healthy heart despite being obese (111 kg at 5'9) and having a bmi of 38 or close to that. i went to the emergency room multiple times, i've done a lot of ecgs, i've went to countless cardiologists, nothing appears to be wrong with my heart except that i get infrequent premature ventricular contractions. despite all of that i still have constant anxiety that my heart will just suddenly give up and stop because it is being overworked all of the time due to my increased body weight. also i went down the rabbithole of researching about study related to cardiac arrest. i've read countless article and study about idiopathic ventricular arrythmias and sudden cardiac arrest in young healthy people and it just made my cardiophobia worse. there were time where i wa so obsessed with my heart that i went to the hospital and took ecg test every single day and i would analyze these ecg result myself at home for hour with the help of google trying to look for anything that is out of the ordinary, i had this belief that there must be something that the doctor didn't notice, something so little yet so dangerous, a rare heart condition perhaps.   


i know this is 100% irrational but i just can't stop thinking about my heart all the time, the anxiety is ruining my life. 

is anyone here experiencing something similar? or ha experienced something similar? if yes, how are/were you able to cope with it?   


also a question for anyone here who is more educated than me on the topic of cardiology, do obese people just suddenly drop dead even if they have normal heart (obesity ----&gt; cardiac arrest)? or do they develop heart disease that lead to sudden cardiac arrest? (more like, obesity ---&gt; heart disease ----&gt; cardiac arrest) like is the connection between obesity and sudden cardiac arrest direct or indirect? i've done a lot of research about cardiology, but most of the study that i read did not address this tiny detail, they just say that there's a relation between sca and obesity, however they do not say whether this relation is direct or indirect.   


i'm aware that obesity is harmful to my body and overall it make me look bad and physically unattractive, that's why i've been trying to lose weight. but i still have this anxiety that i might just suddenly die (from cardiac arrest) before i actually finish my weight loss journey.",anxiety

it started with work, work emails, and then moved to text id get from colleagues. i have a work cell, but i knew if i used the work cell a intended id never pick it up and avoid it altogether. but now, anytime anyone texts, dms, or email me, i cant respond. im so afraid (?) or stressed out by being needed.

1936,"i have really bad anxiety when it come to singing in front of anyone. im not a singer or anything, im just talking about casually singing like singing along to a song in the car or singing along with friend or family when music is playing. im not worried about my voice/what i sound like but i just cant bring myself to sing around anyone. when im at home by myself i enjoy listening and singing along to music. but if music is playing around other people and i want to sing, i just cant, i feel like i freeze up. i suffer with social anxiety and can be quite awkward anyway and i feel like this singing fear just make thing even more awkward for me. for example, i dont go to bar or club with friend because everyone is able to dance and sing and enjoy the music and ill just sit there awkwardly doing nothing even though i want to enjoy it. ive been in situation where ive gone to a bar with friend and just left straight away because i feel so awkward and feel like people probably think im weird. another example is when im in the car with someone and theyre playing music and singing along and im just sat awkwardly feeling uncomfortable, i wont even bop my head to the music. but when im home by myself or with my sibling (the only person i can sing in front of), i enjoy the music and sing. growing up, i wa fine and never had this issue. it been going on for about 10 years. and now that it been so long, i feel like people are so used to me being silent and if i wa to just start singing they would be shocked. i wont even play music at home if my parent home. it might not sound like a big deal but i just want to overcome it a it stop me from going out and being able to enjoy certain things. and when i do go out i just feel like im so boring because of it. ive never met anyone else with this problem and ive never told anyone about this because i feel it would just make it more awkward for me. ha anyone else gone through this or doe anyone have any advice on how to overcome this?",anxiety

the take a deep breath advice ha frustrated me all of my life. but establishing a practice of breathing where i do nothing other than simply notice the thought appearing in my head ha been game changing. it give me the ability to view the thought a what it is- not to judge it or attach anything to it, but just to view it a a thought. *i didnt choose to worry about my car not starting today, that thought just appeared out of nowhere*

1959,"tw: ocd. 22f. i have severe ocd, am on medication for the same a well a going to therapy. i am also a final year med student. now i've had a bad relationship with my grandmother. she is a narcissistic and a very bad person. she ha hurt my parent and me in many ways. however she is now part of our family and stay with us. we take care of her. but the problem is, being a med school student i feel obliged to take care of her. like recently her bp wa 180 and i urged my parent to take her to the doc and they did call the doc up the next day and finally went to the clinic yesterday. she is now on medications. now the internet say that when you start new med for hypertension you need to monitor blood pressure. which mean that i will have to check her bp. i don't mind doing it, except i don't know much about it and my parent don't really believe in going to the doctor all the time. like even when her bp wa 180 my parent weren't taking me too seriously about it being an emergency (which apparently the doctor also said wa ok). now with all this bias and all, i don't feel like checking her blood pressure. but being a med student and the only one who know how to check bp i feel like i should do it. i don't know.

edit: my medical student friend told me it wasn't my responsibility to check her bp and all. and he said that maybe when she ha headache or dizziness i can check cu that is sign of hypertensive crisis which can also be life threatening. however, i didn't bother telling her that if she had a headache or something to tell me to check. i just didn't give a shit for like the entire weekend and then on monday when i wa leaving for uni, i saw her in the morning and i got this thought, ""if i don't tell her and if we miss the sign she can die"". but it felt very weird to tell her right in the morning when she had just gotten up to pee and go back to bed. but i felt really guilty so i told my mom that if she complains about it, it could mean that her bp is very high. now i gave my mom this information but i kept it away from my grandmother for like an entire weekend despite knowing it could kill her if she didn't know. and with all my biased against her, i feel like this is attempted murder. what do you think? help me.

edit: so now recently her bp shot up to 200 and i freaked out. told my dad it might be an emergency. even he got a little worried and he asked her if she's feeling ok. she said she's surprised her bp is this high because she doesn't feel dizzy. then they decided to call the doctor rhe next morning which they did. dr increased her dose and said not to check her bp every day and instead check it every 3 day instead. he said to follow up in 10 day or so. now today is the 3rd day.  but i am feeling lazy to go and check. i asked my dad if i should check it today or just do it tomorrow. he said tomorrow is fine. i also don't wanna check now because then i won't be at home for the next few day and i'd rather check it tomorrow and leave home instead. would this make a difference?",anxiety

but it is not just insecurity that come to the forefront. i have had different type of intrusive and stuck thought in the past and i am definitely noticing that i am getting those again too.

it answered: ""yes, it is common for people who suffer from anxiety to listen to familiar music. this is because familiar music can have a calming and soothing effect, which can help to reduce anxiety. when we listen to familiar music, it can activate the part of our brain that is associated with feeling of pleasure and reward, which can help to improve our mood and reduce feeling of anxiety.

listening to new music, on the other hand, can sometimes be stimulating and exciting, which can potentially increase anxiety. this is not the case for everyone, a some people may find that listening to new music help to reduce anxiety. however, for many people who suffer from anxiety, listening to familiar music can be a helpful way to cope with anxiety and improve their mood.""

i'm so fascinated by this because when i wa younger i could listen to a new album and be fine, but nowadays before i add an album to one of the playlist i listen to when i want to unwind i often have to have it on a new playlist and listen to it 4 time (i've found from experience that 4 time seems to be the magic number) before it can become something i listen to to take comfort in.

t his wa by far the most adrenaline including nightmare i've ever had. not the goriest, not the most disturbing, not the most gruesome. but this morning i awoken to my heart pounding so hard i thought i wa gonna die. 

i dreamed mike myers and this crazy lady were trying to get me. i had to go into this run down trailer to find a key. had to sneak around this massive woodland property and went into the trailer three seperate times. on the third try the key finally appeared. 

well the joke wa on me because a soon a i walked out on of the room and opened the door: mrs. psycho wa already there. she wa beating the literal shit out of me. shit felt so real. 

i ended up gouging her eye out then bashing her face in with some imaginary statue and she still wouldn't let go or die! i ended up escaping the trailer, floating upwards and almost flying on out of there. 

one thing i really hate is that during nightmare i levitate really slow and can't go that high. my enemy are always right on the tail end of my foot and i'm in arm reach.

1974,"(sorry in advance if this is long!)

i've always had social anxiety. 
five year ago when i wa studying at college the pressure of academic success wa overwhelming and i had my first panic attack, followed by almost a year of daily panic attacks. it wa the lowest i've ever felt but thankfully my partner encouraged me to try a cbt program with the ok from my doctor. after a tough year of weekly sessions,my panic attack were gone and i felt confident in myself and so much better around others. 

the last 7 year i've been in a comfortable job where all the staff were super friendly and kind people, i wa never one to complain about work ,the job wa alright but i looked forward to my shift because the staff were my friends. i had to force my self away from fashion retail to pursue my dream career when the opportunity arose.
i absolutely enjoy and am passionate about my new line of work but it wa a huge leap for me.

however, since last fall my mental health ha taken a sharp turn since the change of work and i'm really struggling. 
my new team are ok on the whole,it could be worse but it's not how i imagined. two people i connect with but the others are more invested in shallow interest that if i don't align with, i feel ostracized at time and there's a few people who always give backhanded compliments,have a snarky attitude or use that condescending tone of voice to make me sound like an idiot when i'm around.

i'm always on edge,so much so i feel constantly exhausted and am beginning to not only second guess and stutter my word at work but at home too. i feel constantly overwhelmed, a bit from my new work load, and the constant stream of loud conversation, but mostly from trying to fit in. it's so difficult,i feel like i come across a too nice but boring ,my interest don't run a deep a theirs on certain topic and i hear them talk about it and dissect these topic all day every day. no one asks how i am and if they do it's just a formality,i can tell they're disinterested. i also hear a lot of gossip which i hate because i'm sure they talk about me behind my back if they do that about others.

i know i can't be friend with everyone but this is the first time since a teenager i've felt so insecure at work. i love my job but the social dynamic are exhausting. i feel tired and tearful and stupid,i can't get my word out properly,i can't connect with people and i feel sad that it feel like there's something wrong with me.

 i'm probably being too sensitive but going from a work place where everyone wa lovely and supportive to an environment that's competitive, loud and where most people will try to one up eachother by putting others down ha really rocked my confidence a lot.

i guess i'm writing this because i'm curious if anyone else with anxiety ha had a relapse with a new job? 

how do you cope knowing you don't fit in? 

or that you're trying to be friend but it doesn't work? 

i'll be some time before i can see a therapist again but i'd love to hear someone else's perspective or simillar experience.

2006,"tw kinda gross story time

background; a week ago the dish started stacking up over a period of 3ish day (i dont eat very much but my bf and roommate both work out and inhale food like air), and one of the thing that stacked up were the boy shakers, and they had yuckies(lol) growing in them, so i washed everything but those. i wanted them to deal with whatever wa growing big and strong in those shakers. also i dont go to my bfs hockey game because they go from 9:45-11:45pm at night, and i have heightened evening anxiety so i just stay home. 

my bf left for hockey like 20 minute ago, and he always take his squirt water bottle for the games. other than hockey, im the one using it, since it the only thing i want to drink water out of (idk why my brain work like that, maybe it because it his so i want to use it). he left his protein shaker bottle so i can use it instead. i remembered what had happened the week before, but drank from it anyways since he been using it everyday since then. i only took a tiny sip, but that alone left me gagging. big mistake. i then sniffed it to see if i wa really tasting what i thought i was. bigger mistake. most disgusting thing ive smelt in a long time. how tf ha he drank from that for so long??!! he doe seem to have an iron stomach because he eaten a lot of questionable thing in the past. 

needless to say i threw it out immediately, and texted him about how nasty it was, letting him know it now in the trash. im going to let him use my shaker a long a he clean it a soon a possible after using it. there no way im letting him drink mold water. 

anyways i am having a panic attack from drinking moldy shaker water but typing this out is made me feel a little better.",anxiety
2007,"hi guy im malcolm and i have social anxiety!
ive seen no-fap teen who claim they have the knowledge of the god and yt guru state that the gym is good for breaking down social anxiety. i truly believe it is and feel exuberant when i bum out a work out. today wa an entire different story however. lemme tell you why. 

im 22 at the moment and hit a breaking point recently. my family suck cow dick, i grew up from a lot of verbal abuse, moved from different schools/states multiple times, and needle to say im a black male who ha seen countless medium that depict how scary the world can be for us. needle to say my social anxiety is at fucking large. a week ago i said enough and decided to edit my diet, see a therapist, meditate and go to the gym consistently. i even got a personal trainer. our first session went well so i figured alright this is okay let keep this up. and for the most part it wa ok until the trainer threw a rope ladder on the ground.

my whole buddy buzzed a i started to calculate what the fuck the rope wa going to be used for. just like that my trainer (matt btw) began to side shuffle in between the empty space left foot and right foot in swift motion, jumping all the way down one way before he came back to me. you got that? matt said a i stood there back stiff a a board. i think so. i stood in front of the rope and stared at the mirror in front of me which showed the reflection of all the people working at the gym. the worst part is 20ft from my right side maximum wa nelly, the gym worker and the most gorgeous woman ive ever seen. 

i looked back at matt and said can you show me again? my coordination feel off right now. to be completely 100% that wa true, my anxiety made it feel like i wasnt even within my body and even if i tried to move i wouldve looked like the terminator doing the dutch. you got that matt went again. sure. i started moving and exactly like i said they might a well have casted me in place of arnold schwarzenegger. part of me wanted to run away and say ill be back too. i eventually stopped and frustratedly told him i couldnt do it. dont be frustrated if you cant do a workout, it will lead to failure. thats why im here to guide you matt replied. matt is 19 btw and im 22.

but the thing is i wasnt frustrated i couldnt do it, i wa frustrated because i could. needle to say im here for advice on how you gym boys/girls handle this or hear your stories. while i believe the gym can help social anxiety, it can most definitely highten it a well. i want to eventually make it to where i can move my body freely and lose focus around me, because a my workout get more intense ill require that. and this isnt just in the gym, it in any social gathering. it enough anxiety attack your mind but it hit the body too.. at this point id rather fight corona.",anxiety

i've been dizzy all day and now im having a full on panic attack, feeling like i want to die.  i don't want to be someone who need to take medication every day? i havent felt this feeling of panic in 7 months, since i first started the medication and now it's all coming back after only a week of being off. it's just unfair.",anxiety

2013,"i am getting married about a year from now. my fiance and i started sending out save the date to people we hope will come to the wedding.  

anyways, my fiance ha a brother who is a couple of year younger than him. his brother ha a fiance that i can not stand. let me paint the picture. 

his brother's fiance is a rich party girl who need to make everything about her. whenever i hear my fiance talk to his brother, she constantly ha to talk over his brother. she like to brag that she is my fiance's mother's favorite significant other. part of me started to think she is jealous that my fiance's brother hasn't asked to marry her, yet they have a 3-year-old son. 

my reason for my belief that she is jealous is that when i sent save the date a my fiance requested she made fun of my handwriting and told everyone i referred to her a him. i did not do that. 

it really hurt my feeling though. i've never met her in person. 

anyways, fast forward to now, she added me on facebook after telling everyone i didn't have social medium and my fiance stuck up for me and said i don't use it. her request is pending. i will not add her. she seems to enjoy causing problem for people and needing constant attention. 

i am wondering if i should delete my facebook completely. 

i understand she may want to be friends, but i feel weird about it. i don't like her a we are completely opposite people. my fiance said that he agrees she ha invaded my privacy. 

i felt forced to send the save the date to her and my fiance's brother. another part of this is that my fiance wanted his nephew at the wedding and all the sudden, they claim they can not bring him to where we live on an airplane a it's too expensive. my fiance is extremely upset by a lot of this. 

instead, they plan on leaving the 3 year old for 4 day with her parents. my fiance find this odd a well. 

i don't know what to do. i've told my fiance that it is their decision whether they bring their son. i feel like not having a reception now and finding a quicker way to get married a his brother and his brother's fiance give me mass anxiety.",anxiety

2015,"i wa on a business trip this week and had a flight home at 1 pm. i popped into the office for a few hour before heading to the airport, and wa pulled into a meeting that ended at 11 am. the office is 15 minute from the airport and i wa flying domestically from a small airport. i'm the type of person who like being at the gate 2 hour before my flight so i immediately started panicking. i still had to return my rental car, i needed to take the shuttle from the rental place, i needed to get through security and to my gate, etc etc etc. this wa my first time visiting this location... what if i got lost on my way to the airport, what if i took a wrong turn, what if i got into an accident, what if i wa navigating to the wrong airport entirely?

i wa physically shaking a i wa driving to the airport. i wa still shaking while i wa returning the rental car. i only finally calmed down when i got to the security line at 11:30 and there were 4 people ahead of me. i wa at the gate at 11:42. a full hour before boarding began.

logically i knew i had plenty of time to get to the airport on time. i had done the math many time that morning and the night before and i knew that leaving at 11 made sense. i could not talk myself down though.

i texted a friend from the gate and she said: ""what's the worst that could happen? you miss your flight?""

2050,"i have had anxiety my whole life and it's been up and down. i also have ocd, and i worked extensively with an ocd specialist for a few year with great improvement. i have a therapist, and i like her, but i don't think she's a helpful a she could be, but after emailing 40 therapist and getting 5 response (for therapist who were not good fits), i'm not ready to look for another therapist. i'm on high dos of ssri and i get ketamine treatment for depression. anxiety isn't new to me, per se.

4 year ago i wa diagnosed with gastroparesis. basically, my stomach doesn't digest at a normal rate and food sits around for far too long. imagine eating the biggest meal of your life, and then living like that 24/7. that's how i feel. it's been relatively well managed but this past month i've gone into a horrible flare. i am severely nauseous 24/7. i can barely eat. please **do not** recommend me nausea drug in this post, i have gotten all the recommendation and i do not need any more. this isn't what the post is about. i am rushing to get an appointment with a neurogastroenterologist who might help me, but meanwhile i just feel real crappy all the time. i work full time a a veterinary technician running anesthesia and not working is not an option.

i have a lot of fear around the ""what ifs"". what if i throw up (huge emetophobe)? what if i eat this food and it make me nauseous? what if i don't feel well and i'm stuck at work? what if i have to call out to my new job? what if i'm just going to feel sick forever? i'm perpetually anxious about it. i've tried working on acceptance and commitment strategy but it doesn't change the fact that if i accept that i eat something, and i feel unwell, that i feel *unwell*.

here are some idea we came up with in therapy, but i wa wondering if anyone else related and perhaps had some advice:

1. drop the ""what ifs"". let them go, schedule them for later
2. self-care whenever you can
3. don't push yourself to do thing you don't want to do just because you feel like you should be doing them, ex: don't force yourself to eat new food that might make you feel unwell while at work. save that for the weekends.",anxiety

i just wanted to ask about an anxiety related issue that i have not been able to get adequate feedback about, both online and from doctors.

about 3 year ago i started developing this tic in my throat (caused by severe anxiety) which basically manifest into a bad respiratory depression in my lung and hypoxia/lack of oxygen to my brain and legs. it's beyond horrific and when it set in i sometimes have it all day(except for sleep) and can last for months. i cannot think and sometimes feel like passing out. then it go away just like that. then flare up again when anxiety is bad and the respiratory tick set in causing the whole chain reaction of symptoms.

it's really bizarre but is the worst issue i have had to deal with in the last 3 years. doctor don't care and tell me to take a benzo. i even tried this but some benzos tend to amplify the discomfort in my lung and worsen symptoms.

the next day, i still had the random chest pain and my arm wa still weak and heavy feeling so i went to urgent care and had an ekg and all wa good. 

then literally the next day i went for a walk and tried to jog a bit and my left arm got super numb and i wa able to feel my pulse in my arm and it freaked me the fuck out so i went to the er and they did cbc blood tests, d-dimer, and a few other heart related one , ekg, x rays, blood pressure... all came back good and they said the chest pain were costocondritis (rib inflammation)

so now the chest pain have subsided but the arm numbness come and goes.  my left arm is still weird feeling but it shifted to my right arm and my right leg now too.  what the fuck?! 

does anyone else experience this weird shifting of numbness/weakness in the limb for mulitple day during/after extreme stress/anxiety?

but she actually told me i'm experiencing high functional depression, which i didn't thought i had until then. she described it a a highly functional and masked depressive episode. so i guess that's a diagnosis.

my psychiatric wrote that i had depression and anxiety disorder on the med paper but didn't said something like 'well, your diagnosis is - insert an specific disease-', he just told me them a symptom between another lot of symptom that must be treated.

honestly, i'm kinda disappointed, but i have to say that i want to have a diagnosis just to justify myself, to be able to say  ' i'm like this bc i'm diagnosed with [...] and i can't do anything about it'. i recognize that this isn't good, i don't want to feel like this. my therapist and my psych describe me a a really anxious person which is true, and we perfectly know my issue and how they affect my life, i must be fine with it. but i need to go further to be valid, honestly social medium (specially tiktok teen lol) made this, it like they refuse to see the experience of anyone who doesn't have an official paper that say 'anxiety disorder' a valid. going to the doctor isn't getting a positive test for covid or aids, it's not something that can be labeled with a tool. they act like 'you aren't able to feel like i feel bc your doctor didn't diagnose you'. 

i relate to most anxiety things, it wa a relief for me to be able to put a name to what wa happening and realize that isn't normal to live like this. i could finally understand everything. but i've always thought that receiving a diagnosis would be a document that validates my illness after a test or something like that, like the diagnosis paper you receive when you get a x-ray summary  or something.

the very first appointment last week wa ok, i had to go in alone though because of covid restriction which put me on edge, when i had wanted my husband to be there with me. the dentist wa very matter of fact, took xrays and told me that i needed a tooth removed a crowding had caused it to start rotting. i've had extraction before so i knew what wa going to happen. 

i went back on tuesday for the extraction. again, had to go in alone, but i wa keeping it together because i knew that the anaesthetic injection wa the most painful part then it all numb and you feel nothing. or so i thought. 

i get in the chair, two injection later i'm starting to feel the numbness kick in. the dentist start to pull the tooth - and it wa excruciating. i start shouting to stop and he seems surprised that i'm feeling pain. i think i started to go into shock because i wa trying to breathe and tell myself i just needed more anaesthetic but i burst into tears. i told the dentist that i wa scared and he said that he thought i would handle it better because i'd had child (he wa asking me about myself while waiting for the numbness to kick in). 

i had another injection and a few minute later he tried again. it wa still just a painful and i started to panic. i wa hyperventilating by this point because i realised this wasn't going to be painless. the dentist wa talking to me but i don't remember that much except he wa telling me that because the tooth wa rotten it could be why it wa hurting, and that i wa hyperventilating and i needed to calm down. he also said that if he referred me for sedation and removal that it would take a long time because i'm an nh patient. i basically understood from him that it needed to removed now or i'd be stuck waiting too long. 

he gave me another injection. i could tell that it still hurt because when i bit down on my now partially removed tooth i wa still getting shooting pain into my gum. i didn't have much choice by this time, and i wa still hyperventilating. the dentist wa saying that i wa hyperventilating and that ""normal people don't breathe the way you're breathing right now"". i didn't know what to do, or how to calm down, i wa trying to breathe normally but it wa difficult. he asked me what i wanted to do. i told him to just do it because i knew i wa going to be in pain either way. and yes, it hurt, but i just closed my eye and did it. 

i couldn't get out of there fast enough. the receptionist had to unlock the door for me to get out. i felt traumatised. i haven't been in that pain for years. i didn't realise that tooth extraction could be painful. i thought that the injection would make it painless. i can't stop thinking about it. 


sorry this is so long i just needed to tell it somewhere. thank you if you've read the whole thing. 

tldr had a tooth removed and it wa so painful i hyperventilated and now i feel traumatised and can't stop thinking about it.",anxiety

2086,"i've always been scared of lifts, huge crowd and cows. yes, cows. but these fear were few and far between and my life wa full and enjoyable. 

i (27f) have had a bit of a traumatic childhood; i wa sa'd by one of my family members, and abused in other ways. i wa a bit anxious a a kid, but slowly got better and by my late teens, enjoyed life a one should. i had no panic attacks, no anxious thought unrelated to my fears, and everything wa good.

i joined the military at 22 and went on deployment, thoroughly enjoying being busy and working hard. i ha load of friend and wa comfortable financially.
deployment wa good - i had a constant routine, company and a busy life. in a huge plot twist, i got sa'd when i wa overseas and i wa too busy to process anything that had happened. a lot of bad thing happened to me in my last unit that i swept under the rug and never dealt with.

i'm 27 now and 5 month ago i got based in a big city, doing a more corporate job for the military. i quickly got settled, making friend and living my best life. life wa never better.

over the past four months, however, something in me ha changed. the free time of this 9-5 posting mean i come home and have time to think.

i live alone in a flat and worry i will die alone. my chest and throat feel tight and i have panic attacks. sometimes i worry that if i breathe out for too long, i won't be able to breathe in. this panic ha trickled into most of my afternoons. my body tingle and ache and i feel so out of control.

i enjoy my job and don't want to lose it because disclosing this to medic will make me non-deployable and that is the only thing that give me routine and social life.

i have to pretend to be strong, even when it trickle into my job. the other day, i tried to talk and word wouldn't come out of my mouth. this ha never happened to me before and it scared me so much.

i can't forget or let go of any event that made me upset and werw never resolved. i had a total of 3 anxiety attack at school last year and everyone came to the conclusion that i wa just looking for attention, and even imitated the way i wa breathing to make fun of me. i have supportive friend but i know that they'll hate me if they find out how i really am. i fucking hate myself. i wa born a gifted kid but i can't fucking do anything anymore. i take medicine for anxiety and depression but it doesn't do shit, and i wa going to the therapist but i can't bring myself to talk about my real problem to her. hell, when im ""calm"" i can't even understand how i feel. im only being able to type this because i just had an anxiety attack after a fight with my parents.

everyone complains that im too pessimistic but whenever im optimistic thing only get worse. i can't take this anymore. nothing get better and i just hurt everyone i love. i hate myself more than anything. i just keep thinking of way to kill myself whenever im like this. but when im ""calm"" im almost a completely different person. im fucking tired of this, i just want it to be over. i can't take this anymore. it's literally ruining my life and no one listens to me.",anxiety

recently, thing have gotten weird, a in symptom i have never had any experience with before, and im beginning to wonder if i need to worry about something more than anxiety?

ive been under a ton of stress lately, just too many life event piling on top of one another, and ive begun experiencing what i can really only describe a out of body-ness? and it come on out of nowhere and is usually the direct cause for a panic attack to begin because it freak me the hell out. 

a couple of examples:

ill be walking and look down at my leg and suddenly feel like im not even controlling them? like, theyre moving, but i cant feel them moving. to the point where it mess with my brain so much, i feel the need to sit down because i just feel unsteady.

same thing with my hands/arms. i had to pull over on the side of the road the other day because i wa convinced i wa not in control of my hand - like i wa waving them around but couldnt feel the air that they were waving in if that make any sense? - and i had to take a little breather in the grass (on the side of a busy highway with a couple concerned passerbys. kind people, but quite embarrassing.)

and it not numbness. ive tried looking this up and all i find are about feeling numb or a tingling sensation. it not that, but more so a type of emptiness in my limb that i just cannot describe. 

has anyone else experienced something similar and if so, can maybe put a name to it so i can stop feeling so out of control of myself?

 i currently dont have insurance or the money for it but ive been dealing with dental issues. i have a few cavity and a decayed tooth that i didnt realize i had until about a month ago. this worry me the most because i havent been to the dentist in over 2 year and since those 2 years, i dealt with all sort of mental issue that caused me not to take good care of my health or dental hygiene in general. i dont know what to do because i know how serious dental issue can get but i just cant do anything about it currently

i also have been dealing with stomach issue and other health concern that i just cant get checked for right now. i wa luckily able to dismiss concern i had regarding my brain recently but other than that im scared about my physical health more than ever.

i just really dont feel like myself. it a weird feeling but i feel ive been so stressed that my brain ha just decided to dissociate, and try to bring me back to a time where i wasnt a stressed and my environment just feel like it did back then, it a weird feeling but this same type of thing happened to me another time when i wa really stressed.

2222,"tw: mention of suicide

the ol' nightmare scenario spiral happened while i wa trying to fall asleep tonight. my mom wa out at work and i suddenly started having an intrusive thought scenario where she died in a car crash on the way home.

that wasn't even the most distressing part, though. i have that intrusive thought all the time, i'm used to it, but in the ""aftermath"" portion of the scenario i thought about what my first reaction would be. i would probably panic, i would try to text my best friend for support.

it suddenly occurred to me that my best friend ha rarely given me emotional support in my worst moments, i'd usually get response like ""this is too heavy for me,"" or ""i can't deal with this right now."" or just complete detached apathy and short, blunt response to make it clear they didn't want to be talking to me. 

i tried to think of a friend i could talk to if something like this happened and i don't think *any* of my friend would actually spend time talking and listening to me in this situation. it would not be the first time.

around two year ago i wa going through something extremely hard, i wa suicidal and everyone i knew during that time would just brush me off, tell me off or ignore me whenever i tried to reach out for the smallest amount of comfort. (and since i know redditors love making negative assumptions, i must clarify: no, i wa not being abusive, guilt tripping or suicide baiting.) i had to pull myself together and get better completely on my own under the solid proof that no one i cared about could spare a single shit for me. i wa admitted to a psych ward after a bad breakdown and no one even texted me in the day i wa gone, no one called. i could've been dead and no one would've cared to even find out where i went. the hurt still cause me to break down cry sometimes.

i haven't brought this up to anyone because i don't want them to feel like my attempt wa their fault but jesus fucking christ, it sure wasn't helping.

it ha made me feel. incredibly bad about myself. and questioning if i actually have any real friend at all and how little i must mean to anyone if they can't spend even a small amount of emotional labour to comfort me. i know this is just hypothetical and this hasn't actually happened, but it's heartwrenching to know that it *would,* based on past events. and that i'd be competely helpless and alone.",anxiety

i woke up the next morning, had some breakfast, put on one of the new bikini i had just bought along with a loose tank top and shorts. i got a large beach towel and the rest of my tanning paraphernalia and put it in a bag before walking down to the daniel house. i had noticed yesterday that the house on either side of theirs were vacant; a sign of the time around here. i unlocked the gate and went in. max wa eagerly awaiting me. i told him to sit before opening his gate and then filled his bowl with food and topped off his water. he waited patiently for me to tell him it wa ok to eat and when i did, he dove in ravenously. i left the gate open for him to come out and run around once he wa finished and then i walked to the edge of the stone work pool. i put my bag on one lounge and my towel on another then removed my tank top and shorts. i looked around and decided since the house on both side were empty i could go topless without any fear of being seen. all thing happening in this hot video fucking,sucking, as or mouth bath with cum

breakfast, lunch, dinner.

as time passes, im also eating multiple kind of probiotic and pickled foods.

mostly because im terrified of food poisoning. 

ill crack two eggs, cook them over-medium, and then dump kimchi on it because ive convinced myself the probiotic will help fight salmonella. thats my breakfast.

at lunch and dinner, ill sniff, chew, spit out sample of vegetables/proteins/grains/etc to figure out if theyre safe to eat. then ask my wife to sniff sample to see if theyre safe.

then on weekend i have a flexible diet, but it make me uncomfortable. like, well make a pasta dish, but because the vegetable are cooked, and everything else is 100% cooked through, i assume bacteria is killed. if we go out to eat, i get so scared. i think and dream of food poisoning and death for two day afterward.

22f. just so you know, i know some of y'all might think this a abuse or something. but here in india, it's very normal for parent to have poor boundary and it is definitely not abuse. so pls do not accuse my mother of it. 
so my mom is great. i'm sure she ha anxiety too tho but besides that we have a great relationship. however she used to be super touchy. like just touch my butt or boob (it wa never in a sexual way but more jokingly). only once like 3 year back i wa lying on the bed on my stomach. she came and pulled my pant down and planted a kiss on my ass. i fired her. she did get hurt but i think she understood that wa crossing a line and she never did it again. now last year i got these thought that what if this is abuse (i know that for some people it can be considered a abuse. it all depends on the intention. and i know my mother better than most people and she ha no intention). however last year i thought that may be she is secretly a incestous person, however those were intrusive thoughts. i did talk to her about it and she wa hurt but never crossed a boundary again. however now our relationship ha shaken. she is hesitant to even hug me or so because of how she made me feel. i love my mom and i know that it wasn't abuse. i tried to make her understand that it wa my ocd and anxiety that made me feel that way. along with googling which said it wa abuse. now idk what to do. what should i say to fix this relationship?

and then i just realized i didn't know where to put down thing for today and that it wa all a mess, and i just started screaming again, my heart pounded really fast. i got super frustrated at anyone who wanted to talk to me and just searched on yt for calming videos.

it slowly got better.

this ha happened for quite a couple time now, and no significant issue bother me from the day i forgot to journal.

not only that, going to the dentist really scare me so much, idk why i am so afraid of it, when i wa a kid i used to go alone bc my mom couldn't be with me. but now i am an adult (22 f) and shake just by the thought of it.

what can i do",anxiety
2263,"idk if this will work for most of the people here. but maybe it's worth a try because it helped me a lot. don't eat at least 4 hour before going to bed/lying down. i don't know all the scientific details, but it might be gerd-related and something like the vagus nerve being stimulated/irritated which is worse when lying down. it also could be sugar/carb-related (hypoglycemia-like symptom a few hour after eating).

when i lay down after just having eaten i can feel my heart pounding more which sends me into a downward spiral of physical discomfort and negative thoughts.

treat this a just another thing to try. maybe it doesn't work for you, then just discard it. if it helps, then that's awesome.

not eating and avoiding any sugar/carbs 4 hour minimum before laying down helped me immensely with bedtime anxiety. also helped with the dread and anxiety build up that start earlier before going to bed, the anticipation that i might not be able to sleep well, that i will be helpless against my thoughts, and my health will deteriorate because of it, etc. insert random downward spiral thought here.

2270,"i am in need of some advice. im not really sure what happened, but about a week and a half ago, my anxiety took a severe turn for the worse. i lost my appetite completely and havent had a full meal in over a week - i cant emphasize enough how much this is destroying me. i cant sleep, i cant think, i cant eat, im having more frequent and more severe panic attack than ever, the list go on, and a a full time medical student, this is absolutely debilitating. 

so, about the za. since around the time i started experiencing anxiety many year ago, i found that cannabis wa about the only thing that would actually allow me to relax at the end of the day and peacefully fall asleep. sure, any number of sleep med can knock me out, but they dont let me sit and enjoy a show or a book without my mind racing the entire time. since then, ive smoked almost every night for about five year now, with two several month break during that time. id somehow never built up too much of a tolerance until recently when i realized i wa clearing bowl on my own and hardly feeling anything. a t-break wasnt just a good idea, it wa necessary. 

unfortunately, this t-break happened to coincide with this recent anxiety exacerbation. up until this point ive been able to abstain, but the inability to sleep or eat ha gotten so bad that im contemplating giving in. part of the reason im so committed to taking a break is that i felt i wa beginning to experience the early symptom of cannabis hyperemesis syndrome (chs), but in retrospect, it may have just been my anxiety ramping up because the first thing i usually notice when it get bad is constant nausea. being a daily smoker for a long time, i wa pretty worried about chs and having heard the horror stories, i wanted to do all i could to avoid that. 

this is my dilemma - if i dont smoke, i can hardly eat or sleep. if i do smoke, and i really am on the edge of chs, i wont be able to eat or sleep then either. im just truly at the end of my rope here. any little thing set me off. i dont think ive ever cried this much in my life, and half the time i dont even know why im crying. like i said before, i feel like im losing my mind. so what im wondering is if it would be worth it to break my prohibition early for the sake of surviving whatever the hell this episode is, and then actually take a break when im through the worst of it. i just hate feeling reliant on something like that. dont get me wrong, i love the za with all my heart, but i get an icky feeling thinking about being dependent on it, but i suppose it better to be here and have a crutch than not be here at all.",anxiety
2271,"i'm normally not the most anxious person in the world, but when i'm driving my anxiety spike tenfold. luckily it doesn't mess with my ability to drive, but there are always thought that linger in the back of my mind for a while like ""what if i hit someone?"" or ""what if i hit that car and i didn't know?"" it get especially bad at night where it's super hard for me to see anything. again, the most i do is kinda tense up and shake it off, but those thought stick with me and always lead me to the worst conclusion possible. all this even though i know 1. if i hit someone or something i will absolutely know. 2. my car is on the smaller side so there's le of a chance i hit something. 3. people are (usually) smart and don't wanna get hit also, so they will probably avoid me too.

just recently i wa exiting a parking lot at night and there were lot of car and people around, which definitely stressed me out. there wasn't a lot of space in the aisle but i could move around them safely. or so i think, which is where that little voice in the back of my head is telling me ""what if you hit them and didn't notice?"" even though i wa mindful of them, and wa going relatively slow in the area. i think it might just be the potential consequence that i fear, no matter how unlikely. i always have to check my mirror to see if the person is alright, and if i don't see them (since they likely moved out of the way, changed direction, etc.) i also get worried. i feel like others experience the same thing a me, so is there something i can do to stop worrying so much about these things?",anxiety

im in my first year of university and i feel anxious in literally every waking moment. i don't sleep anymore, in fact im always up till like 4am literally forcing myself to get shit done, but i just stare blankly and cry for hours. to my parent and everyone around me, i probably seem like a lazy piece of shit. i get good mark here and there, but my most recent exam, i got a 53%, i went into a downward spiral after that. i've already dropped an entire class like last month because i exited the lecture after the midterm and literally had an anxiety attack in a bathroom stall. thing is, i've got a 69% in one of my courses, a 88% in the other, and my biology course, i literally have no faith in myself when i study for it, but the lab portion i've done very well in. however, i cant seem to shake this feeling that im just fcking doomed. i feel like im so stupid compared to my peers, and most of the time they only take like 2 hour to complete a simple assignment for a lab, whereas it take me days. it's gotten to the point where i've literally developed an eating disorder a well because i literally cant sit down and eat without crying. i don't know whether im overthinking, or im just screwed. i really also have no one to talk to about this because my mom is quite frankly sick of me cry everyday, she's tired of it, and well so am i but i cant exactly control it. to add on, my dad never really been happy with me and it got worse this wednesday when he yelled at me on my way to school before a very important exam and said that i might a well drop out if i cant handle university, and that caused me to a well have another anxiety attack. i've also fallen out of contact with all of my friend and just spend all my time in my room crying.

i know that it common for many individual to experience a shit ton of anxiety in their first years, but it gotten to the point where ive lost motivation, i cant get out of bed, i don't eat, ive lost hair,cand i've stopped talking to all of my uni friend because im afraid they'll just see right through me. i really don't have the option of dropping out either, or taking a break, i just want to push through and get above a 2.0 in my first year, but mentally im just struggling so much that i feel like an imposter in university... i don't know if i'm even smart enough to be here.

reason i'm mentioning this is because i may go to the doctor because i think it's my heart, but deep down i feel like i'm just panicking all the time. i used to think it wa an ulcer or something because i had started waking up at 1 or 2 to get a small snack before laying down. but i had an endoscopy recently that proved it wasn't. they had to have had me hooked up to a heart monitor though. i also just got a glucose test and they said it's normal. my last heart directed dr appointment wa back in 2020 when they did a stress test. everything wa normal.

are the odds really good i'm just panicking? it'll come and fo without warning and i'm constantly afraid i'll just randomly drop dead of a heart attack and nobody would know.

and no i am not asking for medical advice, if it seems like i am, it just me asking myself these question cuz i feel like im going insane

(p.s. i fell asleep while writing so this wa written in 2 days, sorry if there some stuff that get repeated)

tw: there are trigger in this

it wa october 28th, 2020, i remember it vividly because that day the song more by k/da came out. it wa a pretty normal day, nothing special about it, i wa getting ready for school in the afternoon (i went to an alternative school for my last year, personal reasons), and on my way there everything wa fine and dandy. hour go by in class, and at one point, we were doing agronomy, i start feeling weird, i couldn't focus, it's like i wa tired, but not at the same time, my head felt heavy, my leg wa restless, and when i tried to relax it, i would start shaking it without realizing. the day before i experienced this too, in the same class, but it went away after a while, this time it wasn't going away. my mind started to spiral, 2 day ago, in the evening, i got up from my bed, touched my gaming chair and my head started spinning, it wa more like a hit of vertigo, like i wa falling but i wasn't, it startled me, and also during the summer i sometimes would've felt like i wa weak, or light headed, but didn't think much of it, and now, in class, i wa absolutely loosing my mind. i had to get up, even tho i wa scared of passing out, to go outside and get some fresh air, but it wa not getting better, i called a class mate to bring me my backpack because i wa not feeling well at all and i wa gonna call my parents, she rushed to me, brought me some water and we waited for my parent to arrive, when they got here they were concerned, when i got in the car, i suddenly felt normal, i wa like:""oh i feel better, i wonder why"", then when we got home, i felt sick again, to the point i couldn't eat, so we went to the hospital, i could barely hold myself together, and they said i wa fine. we went back home and called my doctor, he scheduled u for bloodwork and ekg, and guess what, they were crystal clear. this feeling went away after 2 week of constant feeling like i'm loosing my mind, sick, couldn't get up or else dizzy, sleeping almost all day and all night, but hey, when i got better, it felt amazing. i would still sometimes get the hit of vertigo but it wa managable. 

5 month later, it wa back, i woke up during the night in a complete panic, i wa scared, terrified, for no reason, i went back to bed and when i woke up in the morning, the nightmare wa back. more testing, i wa completely fine, nothing wa wrong with me, i wa loosing my mind because i wa convinced something wa actually wrong with me. when the anxiety wa ending, it lasted 2 week also, one night i wa feeling like i had to poop, but whenever i went, to the bathroom, nothing would come out, but i got tired and started pushing, when it came out, i felt my soul leave my body.

(tw: skip this small part if you're easily disgusted by poop and stuff)
when i cleaned myself with some toilet paper, it felt really wet, and when i looked it wa mucus, clear mucus, it also formed a string at the crevice of the paper where my hand wa holding it, and when i looked in the toiler, it looked white/light yellow.

the panicking started, i wa loosing it, i rushed to the doctor and he said it wa just colitis, he gave me meds, but it didn't get better, he then gave me other colitis meds, didn't get better, he blamed this on anxiety, he always told me that it's just anxiety, and what can i say, more bloodwork and stuff, nothing, it never got better, at one point i went for a scan of the colon, they said that there's a lot of gas in the colon and asked if i have anxiety, felt kind of embarrassed in that moment, the doctor then gave me med and yea, after those meds, my upper stomach felt bloated, and to this day, it still sometimes is bloated. from my belly button down, everything is fine, from my belly button up, it feel bloated, the doctor keep saying it's nothing, just air in the colon, it doesn't necessarily affect me physically but it feel weird at touch and look weird. during all of this, i wa also struggling with hyper fixating myself on my heart, lungs, stomach, and when i did i would feel random pain in that area and i would absolutely loose it when i did, at night when i wa sleeping, sometimes if laid a certain way, i would feel a random pinching pain for a split second at my heart area and it would terrify me (this went away). i'm a smoker so lung health anxiety is pretty big. i wa also extremely anxious of cancer or autoimmune diseases, i eat a fuck ton of food, and my arm are extremely skinny, my finger basically skeletal, like picture this: bloated belly, only from the belly button up, toned legs, and skeletal arms, i felt like i wa looking like a freak and something wa extremely wrong with me. i would hyper fixate on everything, my dark circle around my eye which looked so dark and it would terrify me, i had no motivation in anything and wa scared of doing thing i loved such a gaming or going outside, i would lay in bed terrified of feeling a certain way, expecting the most brutal pain, or a heart attack, feeling it come but it wa never coming. and all that i'm saying is still on going, and never left.

may 14th, 2022. 2 day before my trip to berlin, i currently live somewhere that i hate, i wa forced to move here and it never felt like home, i wa happy i could finally travel alone and experience something on my own. 
i wa outside with my best friend, and that day i decided to introduce her to my boyfriend at the time, he wa pretty late because he had a lot of stuff to do at work, but hey at least he came. after a while i start feeling weird, like i first felt in class that day, something wa off, i felt my body moving on it own while i wa sitting down, and when i got up, i could feel that i couldn't keep myself balanced, my heart sank to my feet, my finger and foot were starting to get a tingling feeling, like i had a 100 ant walking on them, like my blood wa boiling from the inside, i started panicking even harder, i told my boyfriend and my best friend that i wa not feeling ok so we decided to leave and grab me some food. while we were heading towards my best friend car, i could feel the tingling getting more intense, going up my legs, started feeling it on my cheeks, lip and tongue, but my boyfriend wa keeping my close to him, and his presence helped me a lot with this. after my boyfriend got out of the car to grab me food and water, my best friend dropped u at his car because i wanted to spend some alone time with him, and wanted to tell him everything about it.
when we were alone i wa panicking more and calming down at the same time, it wa back and forth, but then carried my to the back seat to cuddle me and reassure me, that helped me so much, after 2 hours, i wa back to normal.

2314,"hello everyone, 


i have been both anxious and depressed for about 5 year with even derealization for that last two year that occurred after smoking. 

i wa recently diagnosed with gastritis, quick explanation in my stomach lining is messed up and brought me into getting a endoscopy and living in horrible pain for about a month before a treatment plan plus pill wa given to me. take about 6-12months to heal 

to heal you must sacrifice all processed foods, fried foods, many seasonings, dairy, sweet and almost everything but vegetables, potatoes, rice, chicken and fish, caffeine of all sort and alcohol 

this wa really hard at first a i wa always someone who needed his caffeine in the morning and his beer or wine after work, i wa always extremely anxious to where i dreaded leaving my house and never felt comfortable and could have panic attack if in the wrong setting. after starting this process i have slowly understood that half the battle of anxiety is your diet and avoiding alcohol and caffeine. i always new it never helped but whenever i didnt have it i felt worse. 

here i am 4 1/2 month into healing and i havent felt this good in years, i view myself better mentally and almost have been 90% anxiety free throughout the day. i feel like i have finally peaked into a life without mental issue controlling my everyday.",anxiety

am i overthinking?

2322,"i get very red in the face and neck when im nervous, anxious, or embarrassed. ugh it so annoying!! ive been going to therapy. trying to figure out other way to prevent this. even the thought of going red make me go red lol! anyone ever get experience this? any tips?",anxiety
2323,"title

so yeah i feel shitty about it, i grew up with shitty best friend so it screwed with me a lot growing up, i wa the one in the friend group that wa usually talked over and ignored but always just 'there'. 

now i'm 27, i've decided to take the leap and attend university for a course i've wanted to do for years, but a everyone i live with (i live in university accommodation) is about 18-22 for the first week or so i just wasn't around a my anxiety spiked my depression, it's a big thing moving out for the first time so my emotion hit me all at once. 

skip to now they have their own clique in the group, like for example there's 8 of u and two main group but we're all friends, though three of u are just that at the end of the day just a friend, not really close to both groups. i'm one and the other two are just people that have their group outside the flat, which i don't really have. 

so when i had my depression spike up they all got closer whereas i didn't, so i've had to play catchup in a way. i've spoken to a few in the flat privately after i felt better to explain why i wasn't really around but that i do want to hang out with them more, they were happy for me to hang out a every night we're all usually in the kitchen playing card game but when i do i just can't help myself but not say anything most of the time, it like i just don't have anything to say. 

i do want to be close to these guy a they're generally really fun to be around, but honestly i just can't help it. i do tend to open up more when we're having a drinking night but a lot of the time i don't partake a with my mental health i get into the mindset of i don't want to join in a they don't want me there if they don't speak to me but i know i won't get close to these guy if i don't put in the effort for it, so that's one of the reason stemming from my anxiety that's preventing me to be damn normal here. 

has anyone got any tip here on what to do?",anxiety

2326,"so all of this took place from about 6 month ago. i had a quite bad day to begin with, wa already feeling quite anxious etc.. and i also have depression. so the time wa around 9pm when i took a a drug called mdma, first hour wa good, but then the good vibe around me started to completely fade, and from nowhere i felt chest pain, and this is when i thought i had taken to much, so my thought immediately started racing. is it my heart, am i having a heart attack? did i take to much and it got to the point where i had a full blown panic attack, but i wa convinced i wa dying, so i called the ambulance, and told them i thought im dying from an overdose, within a few minute they arrived, and i wa still panicking. i think it wa pretty clear for them when they arrived that i wa having a panic attack considering how chill they were. but they still got me to the hospital just in case. i ended up being completely fine, no problem with my heart or anything, but i felt very embarrassed about it the day after. anyways, ever since then ive been having bad anxiety, and panic attacks. especially at night when i try to sleep, and feel the slightest uncomfortable thing in my chest my thought immediately start racing, and i usually end up with a panic attack.

2330,"tw: mention of sexual abuse. 
22f. just so you know, i know some of y'all might think this a abuse or something. but here in india, it's very normal for parent to have poor boundary and it is definitely not abuse. so pls do not accuse my mother of it. 
so my mom is great. i'm sure she ha anxiety too tho but besides that we have a great relationship. however she used to be super touchy. like just touch my butt or boob (it wa never in a sexual way but more jokingly). only once like 3 year back i wa lying on the bed on my stomach. she came and pulled my pant down and planted a kiss on my ass. i fired her. she did get hurt but i think she understood that wa crossing a line and she never did it again. now last year i got these thought that what if this is abuse (i know that for some people it can be considered a abuse. it all depends on the intention. and i know my mother better than most people and she ha no intention). however last year i thought that may be she is secretly a incestous person, however those were intrusive thoughts. i did talk to her about it and she wa hurt but never crossed a boundary again. however now our relationship ha shaken. she is hesitant to even hug me or so because of how she made me feel. i love my mom and i know that it wasn't abuse. i tried to make her understand that it wa my ocd and anxiety that made me feel that way. along with googling which said it wa abuse. now idk what to do. what should i say to fix this relationship?

2333,"tw: mention of suicidal thoughts

i've had anxiety almost my whole life but almost every time i try to find a forum or read about people's experience it's almost always focused on physical symptom like racing heart, breathlessness, dizziness and those typical symptom but very rarely do i read about people's emotional symptoms. like what doe the panic or anxiety feel like to you mentally and emotionally?

personally, while i get physical symptom and they are unpleasant, i have never been scared of them like so many people seem to be. but the emotion, what's happening in my brain when i have panic and anxiety is so horrifying it's what make me want to kill myself. 

i feel quite alone in this because everyone always seems to focus on their heart or lungs, and while i get that these physical symptom can be scary and upsetting, they are not a horrific a the nightmare happening in my brain. i don't know why people don't talk about the emotion of anxiety and panic and what it feel like for them. is it because anxiety and panic are already word to describe feelings? because for me they are not enough. i feel those word have become so watered down lately they mean almost nothing to the lay person and also medical professionals.

i experience horror. nightmarish terror. people often describe anxiety a a jump scare, like the feeling you get if a car swerve towards you, and the little racing heart you get for a few minute after that and i just look at them incredulous because if that's all anxiety wa for me i would be able to live my life normally.

and before anyone asks, yes i have been to psychiatrists, i have been to psychologist etc. but why do people not talk about the **emotion** they experience and it's always tachycardia or breathlessness?",anxiety

fast forward to now: i started law school this fall and every single new friendship im making, i find myself constantly worrying that they secretly hate me or think im annoying, that im a burden, and that theyre waiting for the first opportunity to cut me off. i check their location frequently (makes me feel like a creep), overthink everything i say to them, and  read into everything they do/say to me. 

part of me think that that friend breakup a year ago is contributing to this friendship anxiety. im terrified that my new friend and any other one i make will catch onto my anxious behavior and decide im more trouble than im worth. friendship anxiety is now one of the biggest trigger of my gad. it so draining on my mental health.

and just putting it out there that if you're already struggling with anxiety, i know there's lotsa people out there saying medicinal marijuana can help - and it may - but just know that this is one (of many) risks. the last thing you need to deal with is both anxiety and a damaged digestive system.",anxiety

all my test in my retina are normal. 

the issue i have is checking my eyes. im an artist and im having issue with glare on the paper and canvas. im getting afterimage which are quite subtle but noticeable for me. the light reflecting off a ruler becoming a brief afterimage on the paper. is that normal? i dont know. i cant look at my phone on normal brightness now and i get pattern sensitivity. my painting look strobing.

its debatable if the test really did damage my vision. if i had further test it could damage my eye further. doctor dont think so but im not sure.

during the first week it wa the absolute worst, i wa shaking and refused to leave the house, id get scared by the slightest thing like people calling out my name or any touch i wasn't anticipating, and i stayed in bed all week. it got to the point where i got so fed up with my situation that i called her and expressed my frustration, telling her how wrong it wa for her to accuse me of stuff and make me feel like shit because she wa high on her emotions. she started cry over the phone and admitted that she wa acting on emotion and she wa sorry for some of the thing she said, but then spaced out and told me to just hang up when i wa done talking, and asked me to promise not to bring up this conversation with her again. id never seen her tone like that ever and it broke my fucking heart over the next few week until now.

i felt good for about a day after that call. and then right away that pit in my stomach came back and now all i could think about wa her cry and it came back much worse this time, to the point where id have to hold my stomach in my bed at times, i just wanted it to go away. i didnt know what the hell to do. it right around the time when im supposed to be studying for exam and i cant even do that because all i can think about is how ive hurt her. i made the stupid mistake of leaving some voice message to her, trying to give some type of reassurance about the whole accident we had but my emotion were out of control and i dont know if i just made her own anxiety worse, i also apologized for being upset with her on the phone. 

pit went away, i went to my doctor. my doctor told me that she wa going to put me on lexapro for anxiety because shed told me in the past to get on it and now wa kind of my breaking point. soon a i got home, i had that pit in my stomach come back, and i also realized how stupid it wa to send those voice message to her, even if it wa with good intention i should've just left her alone. found out a couple day later i wa blocked.

2382,"people on here seem to forget, that anxiety is a very treatable mental illness. 
there are three things, that are most important in my opinion (approved by a family member, who is a cognitive behaviour therapist, with decade of experience):

1) confront yourself with the thing that cause your anxiety. avoiding them make everything worse. make the realization, that the thing you fear, isn't actually dangerous.

2) work on your thought patterns. f.ex. for social anxiety, remember ""nobody is judging me, i'm not the center of the world, everything will be alright,...""

3) ""sit through"" your anxiety. no breathing exercise or similar things, no drug and don't ask a stranger on reddit to help you calm down from your panic attack. otherwise you become dependent on these things, which is not good at all.
if you do these things, you make the realization ""oh if i do a reddit post, people help me out and make me feel better"", when your realization should actually be ""wow, i just felt extremely anxious, but i'm still alive and my fear wa irrational"". anxiety is a feeling, that always go away after some time.

2423,"it you! 

warning this is a mild science post! 

anxiety is caused by the misfiring of the fight or flight system that is supposed to help keep u safe in life or death situations. the fight or flight system is controlled by the sympathetic nervous system. 

when the sympathetic nervous system activates it start to prepare you to either fight for your life or run for your life. 

it increase your heart rate. it increase your respiration rate. it diverts blood from the stomach and intestine and towards the muscles. a part of brain called the amygdala take control and start prioritising speed of decision making and thinking over making any sense. 

but we have something called the parasympathetic nervous system. it our ""rest and digest"" system. it tell our body to do the opposite of all that. basically says, it safe so chill out and digest your meal then sleep.

luckily we know how to activate that system. you can do it right now! 

sit or lie down somewhere comfortable. place one hand on your belly, one hand on your chest. now breathe in so that the hand on your belly go up and down and the hand on your chest doe not. 

this is diaphragmic breathing. rapid breathing in the chest activates your sympathetic system. slow diaphragmic breathing activates the parasympathetic nervous system! 

now breathe slowly in through your nose for 4 seconds, hold it for 4 second then let it out for 4 seconds. 

do this for 4 minutes. making sure only your hand on belly is moving. 

your body _will_ relax. it ha no choice. 

it won't get rid of worry but it will help you calm down.

2450,"hello everyone, i'll try to keep this a short a possible: 

it all started with an anxiety attack when i had to study for an exam and wa therefore very stressed. i felt a massive sense of anxiety without developing any physical symptom (except of course a slightly increased heartbeat). 2 month later i had the same kind of anxiety attack, but relaxed in front of the tv. i had the third and last anxiety attack 2 week later, also in a relaxed atmosphere. 

since then i have been plagued by a constant feeling of unease / anxiety in my stomach, a if the data line in my brain had now been laid and i would not be able to get rid of it. but i'm not an anxious person at all and i don't really worry about anything. however, since this knot in my stomach ha been there for 5 week now, i am naturally worried about it, which is also human, but of course not beneficial.

at first i thought it might be related to my 8 year of chronic cannabis use, but i have been clean for almost 4 week and have slowly lost hope that this wa the trigger.

i have tried to distract myself by studying for university or doing other activities, but it just doesn't work. this anxiety stomach feeling is driving me crazy. i'm worried that i'm just developing generalised anxiety disorder and becoming a 'nursing case' a a result. i've already seriously considered going to a clinic or at least to a therapist, a i've read many time that such a problem is more manageable if you get help early. unfortunately, the waiting time are exorbitant.

my life is upside down, but enough with the complaining: do you have any tip for me on how to reduce the likelihood of this feeling staying with me for the rest of my life? could you perhaps advise me on a medication that could solve this discomfort in my stomach? maybe someone can share some experience and give me some encouragement. you don't know how much you would help me.

many thanks in advance(!) and greetings

2452,"for context, i'm 17 and have been diagnosed with gad and social anxiety

earlier this year, my pediatrician prescribed me to lexapro and xanax to treat anxiety/depression; at my worst, my parent took these medication to prevent od'ing

my anxiety ha been acting up a lot recently (panic attack in class and work, sleeping issues, overall not being able to function properly) and i no longer have access to these medications. i'm not close with my parent and i don't feel comfortable talking to them about this. since im 17 (minor) and i don't want to talk to my parent about this, is there a way i can see my doctor in private? or would they be notified of it?",anxiety
2453,"so i havent really talked to or seen this friend in 2 year and we just met up again for the first time on monday. we wanted to take the time to catch up, although we were both worried about seeing each other because he been trying to break up with his abusive girlfriend for several month and shes honestly kind of scary at times. shes extremely manipulative and ive had to deal with her myself too personally and just knowing how she is, i feel awful for him and he been telling her at least monthly that he want to be single, which she reply by saying she may hurt herself if he does, or ignores him entirely. 
during our meet, i wa pretty happy that we got to spend so much time together and he told me it wa the least stressed he felt in a long time and we were both enjoying ourselves. when i left, he walked me to my car and seemed bothered. he told me later it made him more anxious because he wa worried i would tell his gf or she would find out, and he feel he is too much of a mess to be around me. i learned he spends a fair bit of time drinking and using drugs, doesnt currently have a job, and is worried about life and everything although he hasnt really explained most of it (which is fine). 
i agreed we could spend some more time apart, he said he want to wait until he better, but the more i think about it im extremely worried about him. he been struggling to cut his gf out of his life for like 7 years, they were broken up for a while but got back together and now he just so obviously  much more upset than the last time i saw him and i dont want to leave him alone like that. my concern though is if i ask to meet with him, it would make it worse.
my plan wa to just text him and ask if i could swing by, i wanted to bring him some of his favorite snack and such and a few games, and a little pokmon figurine i made for him. maybe some dumb little like pampering thing just for fun like a face mask or something lol. then let him know if he want to talk im there and clear up with him the distrust he been feeling about me a much a i can, but if he doesnt i could either leave or we hang out and play some games. i know there will always still be distrust but i want to reassure him and be there for him while he trying to break thing off with his gf and figure thing out. 
for those of you dealing with a lot of anxiety, would this be too upsetting for you if you were him? should i leave him alone and give him the space he wants? im just concerned for him and dont want to just be on the sideline while he spin out but i really dont want to make thing worse for him",anxiety

i'm in pretty huge debt because of the past year, i overworked myself at my new job because it wa hard learning so i ended up not really hanging with my friend much last year or making new friends. and to top it all off, i stress ate myself over where i started (240 lb). 

now whenever i try to eat right or workout, my brain go ""shouldn't you be side hustling or working instead? just eat if you wanna feel better and get back to work"".

i understand that with weight loss and debt you gotta make sacrifices. but damn, i just want to mentally be able to allow myself to relax. i'm turning 30 next year, so that birthday coming up in combination with my debt have made me crank up the side hustling more then i ever have, which i'm shocked and proud of, but i can't turn it iff and it result in stress eating.

2493,"hello,

28yr old male here. struggling with anxiety and panic attack which have turned into panic disorder since 2017. 
a little bit of background before i get into my situation: i grew up i in a cult basically sheltered from the outside world until highschool when i did experience normal i felt evil for doing so. mother had severe anxiety and depression growing up i blamed myself for doing 'evil' thing which god disproved of which caused her and my family to go through all this. i submerged myself into my belief around 17 and wa 100% in. 
i wa a bright kid, always positive, quick witted, great with numbers, real party guy lot of friend decently chill to hang out with from what others would say about me. 
fast forward to 23 yr old me, i had the first panic attack developed some sort of hyperawareness of my body and what i am feeling. i get dizzy, clammy and the classic panic attack symptoms. i freak out i go to the doctor. im fine. it's been the case up to now that i'm 28. 

here's my situation: that bright kid is gone. nothing brings me joy that would back then. but my biggest issue is that i am not a quick a i wa before. at work i feel slow. i work in finance and sometimes i need to be able to articulate and communicate with our client and analyze data but now i feel foggy, slow, anxious... basically incompetent. i overthink my decision which cause there to be error and above all a loss of trust from my team and clients. also my memory is shot now and i feel a if i cannot sleep. i wake up tired. 

anyone with anxiety go through this and how have you overcome it? should i do more test to see if this can be maybe something wrong with my brain? 
please help..",anxiety

tonight a i wa refilling one of those daily med containers, one dropped out (20mg lexapro) and fell on the floor into a pile of clothes. i searched high and low for it, shook out every piece of clothing and looked anywhere it may have rolled but havent found it. i looked so hard in that particular corner of the house that im wondering if i just imagined it falling?? or if i picked it up and somehow forgot??

2522,"hello beautiful people,

i had a shitty day today, somehow got through it, and felt compelled to share my experience on the off chance that it inspires someone else with anxiety and/or depression to kick tomorrow's ass. or the day after. 

i do purchasing for a rapidly growing company, and several day a week my anxiety seems to just eat away at me. today i hit a breaking point, everything just got to be too much for me. i made a stupid mistake yesterday and couldn't stop beating myself up over it to the point where i simply couldn't concentrate on any task. instant panic. everyone fucking hate me, i suck at everything, i should just end my life, all of the negative self-talk bullshit just hit me in waves. i told my bos i needed a bit, took my truck to a quiet spot away from everything, and literally bawled my eye out. 

at first this made me hate myself more. i'm a guy who work with a ton of very masculine guys, and if they saw me bawling my eye out in the middle of the day there would be repercussions- repercussion that might exist only in my head, but repercussion nonetheless. i went into the old thought pattern of contemplating suicide, thinking it would be a hell of lot easier to blow my brain out and end everything than face the music. but somehow, against all odds, i pulled myself together. i don't even know what it was, but something within me brought forth some kind of courage i didn't know wa there. i made the decision to finish out the day.

i feel compelled to share this, because in that moment today of self-hatred and self-doubt, i wa certain that i wa the last person on earth who deserved to be alive. i thought for sure i wa going to succumb to my fear and just run away from my responsibility like i've done in the past. but i fucking didn't. and i guess i feel like if someone a cowardly a i am is able to get their shit together and face the music, there's at least one other person out there, with the same crippling anxiety, who ha the same strength within them. i hope you're able to bring it forth too.

i fucking love all of you. be good to yourselves out there.",anxiety
2523,"simple a that. i am a 24-year-old lesbian and i have never felt like anyone's favorite. no one of my friend ever chooses me. i am always the extra. i wanted to point out that i'm a lesbian because, also, my girlfriend always end up running to other people with no other reason that it just that i've loved this other person for a long time and s/he asked me for another opportunity. obviously, i'm not the favorite daughter either. my parent have already given my sister (20 year old) xmasgifts, and i asked a a joke if they were going to give me something and they just ignored me.

i've tried not to take it personally, but i feel like it's already a consistent pattern. i feel like no one ha ever cared for me, literally. i am an attractive person, not the most beautiful, but i have my physical charm, you know, a fitness body and what society expects of a woman. i've never been bullied for anything either. i tend to be funny most of the time and i also think i have various topic of conversation. obviously i have my flaw like everyone, but in general people like me and it's just that: they like me and that's it. no one ha ever wanted to be my friend. no one ha ever found me interesting. no one ha ever chosen me for anything.

honestly, i'm a little embarrassed to say this kind of thing because i imagine that no one who know me think that i feel this way, but i haven't felt important for year now and i don't know what to do. for all these year i've tried to pretend that i don't care and think that eventually i'll be important to someone. i don't think it's self-love either, because i have self-love, the point is that i feel very alone and that in the long run affect no matter how much self-esteem one has.

i have ocd and generalized anxiety too, surely that influence something in my perception, but frankly i feel that it doesn't. it's a constant pattern to be anyone's favorite. i think the only one who genuinely chooses me is my cat lmao.

i did not expect, however, to be hit so hard with this adjustment anxiety. it ha completely changed my routine. i used to wake up between 11am-12pm, go to bed super late at around 4am, and be home most of the time. now i wake up at 6, clock in at 8, clock out at 5, and home by 5:30. i'm aiming now to try to be asleep by 11 at the latest. but wow it is messing me up so bad from the change. i wa first worried about job duty and such, but a i am slowly getting the hang on it and learning every day, now my anxiety ha shifted to my time outside of work. at work i feel fine, looking forward to going home but not dealing with anxiety. at home it hit me like a ton of bricks. all i can think about it how little time i have after work, keep glancing at the clock, how i miss my family and see them shorter now (my anxiety/ocd grab onto my attachment to my family a lot), how i'm so tired and cant do the hobby i used to do, thinking about waking up early and what's in store for me at work tomorrow. how my job give little time off so i will be stuck most of the time at work, seeming like a death sentence and that i will be in this exact position forever (even though the job is fine!). it even go a far a to be anxious about the 40-hour work week in general, how upsetting it is we all work so long and spend little time at home. it really brings me down and i don't know how to stop doing that. is this something that will go away/get easier time? or any other advice to deal with the adjustment to such a big thing? i messaged my therapist to schedule something soon because i really feel like i wa downward spiraling once at home, when that is the time i want to be in the moment with my family, my own and relax.

for instance, when i make a typo when texting her, her mind jump to the conclusion that i'm in a dangerous situation and can't type properly. just today i returned from the gym with my friend who wanted to charge her phone at my and my boyfriend's place. i message my mom that my friend and i got home safely, she started worrying that since i didn't mention my boyfriend (who wa at home the whole day) we must've had a fight.

now i've always dreamed of becoming a mountaineer, ever since i wa a little kid. my mother always shrugged it off a too dangerous and unrealistic, but now i've moved away and started mountaineering. 

for now i'm just training, she know about and say that it's fine a long a i'm not climbing real mountains. the problem is i want to and will climb real mountain a soon a i'm qualified for it, and i have no idea what to say to her.

we text daily and you can't really do that in the mountains, so lying won't work. i'm not an outdoorsy type, i'm just willing to put up with it for my dream, so i can't tell her i'm hiking or something. i'm also worried that deceiving her might make thing even worse. 

i myself don't have many mental health issue so i don't know how to handle it. also, she doesn't want to go to therapy or do anything to allay her symptoms, and i'm not judging her, just providing context.

so i would be very grateful for any advice since my first trip is scheduled this spring and it will last a whole month. i really don't want to make her more anxious than she already is, but mountaineering is my absolute dream that i can't put on hold.",anxiety

2551,"19 f. this year i started to date ppl for the first time, and it wa fun but also painful. i talked to a lot of ppl but irl had a few date with girl and once with a boy.  on the first weeks/days knowing them i wa really excited and fantasized a lot about our future relationship and when the date became i wa too worried and stressed out that i couldn't even eat for those days. 'what if they dislike me? what if they did catfish? what if they are a horrible person? what if we don't know what to talk about? will we fuck/touch/kiss? my hair feel greasy, i probably look horrendous and smell bad'

any passed from the first or second date, the longest i've been in a situationship wa 3 weeks- she ended up deciding she wasn't ready for a relationship (even though it wa supposed to be casual), that girl... i already felt like i wa in love with her in the second date (lol) and the day after that she broke up with me, after that i stopped dating ppl and i my anxiety and depression got much worse, took me about two month to get over her. it still hurt to see her ig. with the others date i wa always the one who cut off the talk.

well, a you see i'm too delusional on dates, i end up cry for day for each-one-of-them. it doesn't matter if i broke up with em bc i think they were ugly irl, i wa devastated anyways like if it wa a divorce. and took me about one or two week to recover from each fail.

now, after quitting date for some time, i started to talk with a girl i've known since high school (she's been my crush for years), and she like me back, it would be anyone's dream to have a chance with their crush that seemed to be unreachable. but i'm frustrated and bothered. we had our first date two day ago and she seems to be really good. but i'm imagining red flag all the time, i'm searching out reason to not date her. and since our date i've been feeling horrible. 

it wa always difficult to chat with her on social media, she just never answer, or last a lot to text ne back. i'm tired of insisting. but on the other hand she's always searching for me on college and she seems really enthusiastic about being around me and told me several time how attracted she is to me, it's like i'm a big crush but she ignores me on chat... 

i came up to think that she find me ugly, that i'm cringe, that she's annoyed by me, i'm jealous of her friends, i've spent hour waiting for her to text back, checking if she's online, i'm literally obsessed and anxiety make me think about this all day, i feel like a pervert(?) . this situation is too much for me, now i'm angry and decided not to talk to her until she text me again.

i want to be in love and have a partner, have sex, cuddle, kiss, etc. but all that make me really anxious and i get obsessed and jealous really easy with everyone. i get insecure and tend to have a lot of intrusive thought and search for redflags anywhere when i'm in a situationship. 

i just feel i won't be able to handle a relationship never. 

and lastly i'm not sure about dating ppl bc i think 'we're going to break up someday, what's the purpose?', i don't want to meet someone who'll fuck up my mental health, we'll break up in weeks, month or years. what's the point of having a partner if it's going to end in a horrible way? every relationship ends. so why would i expose myself to that? i'm refusing the idea of engaging now bc of that, and that's why my anxiety boicots my dates.",anxiety

2553,"slight tw: mention sa and emotional manipulation

i feel like nothing else, i need to have this written down somewhere. someplace that i can put this all without fearing someone overhearing and getting backlash or told that i don't have the right to complain, like ha happened before. it's a bit long, so tldr will be at the bottom. posting to throw away for reason that will be obvious soon. 

so the situation is simple, i joined a community to live a stress free and more simple life to help with my anxiety and depression. they promised to do everything by consensus and we would all be equal, and we wanted to be a self sufficient place to live, work hard, and help others. all thing that i wanted and i hoped would help me be fulfilled. it wa going through some growing pains, but everyone thought with an indie music concert that we would be able to help continue running the place and get more like minded people to work with to do more for ourselves and others. 

however, after one of the founder brought a friend to help with her alcoholism is when we realized this wa all a lie and to line the pocket of the founders. the friend, g, told another who had oved in, t, that she had dealt with some unwanted advance and emotional manipulation to try and get sex, and being told a lot of sexual thing to make her uncomfortable for his gratification. t wa told not to say anything and that g would be leaving quietly. t told my roommate anyway, who told me, and we talked with g because we got very worried. (in the end g wa glad we knew and stayed, but that's not how it should have gone.) 

afterwards, another couple moved in a we were helping g, who also helped her, and it led to u finding out that not only did the founder purposely lie about how the money wa being used, but altered the information on the account to hide where it wa going and purposely used method for u to not have full access to the account (which wa explicitly stated to be open to everyone and had the password shared to everyone). all while saying we were running low on money and making the rest of u pay for it (and causing one person to work so much he collapsed and almost ended up in the hospital) . and when confronted, he changed the password on all account and the community email (which wa also meant for everyone to use and given freely to us).

as time went on, we all realized we had to leave, and we tried to get off the property. however, there's no rental property available until the new year, and i have several rabbit that were supposed to be part of living sustainably that need a new home (which is part of a whole different type of abuse involving them, the chickens, dogs, and cats). this wa told to the person (founder's friend, m, who boast a lawyer friend on call who is friend with the police and ha no issue using to throw his weight around) who wa the only one who will face u a the founder ha holed up in his dirty room and us m a a puppet. 

we were told that one) we had no right because we didn't own the property (this includes privacy, like when a stranger braged into an apartment without knocking while the person wa asleep, and m said he had no right to asking for anyone knock or to tell someone wa not allowed in), two) that we were to have the animal and ourselves off by the end of the month or pay rent (them being only told two day prior the renting issues, so this wa very deliberate) despite a) them constantly saying they had no issue helping those in need (i.e. u at this time), and b) not serving an official notice of any kind to us. 

as we face this, we're constantly dealing with mental health issue and the two just trying to manipulate u to either continue giving them money or act a worker so they can sell the place because they're too cheap and lazy to do it themselves. we are expected to stay and pay rent while acting a a cleaning service, or knowingly kick u out while there's no where to go, without any paper to make it official.

i'm not sure what i can do in a situation like this and due to my severe anxiety, i am constantly having to abate panic attack and the symptom of the constant stress. my roommate are also dealing with this, but we're not sure what to do. we know we have to get out, but option are running out, and we may be trapped if the snow becomes too dangerous. i'm trying to get my family to help, but who know what might happen and what to do if thing don't work. 


tl;dr: i moved to a community to do something good and to live a better life, but one of the founder wa using it to get free money and abuse people. now we are being told to leave without any legal document while there are no place available and dealing with the winter weather and relocation of animal caught up in the abuse. all while dealing with unnecessary stress caused by two manipulators.",anxiety

2564,"when i used to study history in college, i would make joke whilst we were waiting for the teacher to arrive with the intent of trying to calm myself socially. i didn't consider that other people would take my joke to heart and seemingly choose to become offended by them. i wa always the outlier of the group, i never belonged to any particular social group, despite trying constantly to form a social identity for myself and regrettably wasting my teen doing so.

i hadn't had enough experience with people to really understand the social dynamic of a group environment, where it seemed a though only the people these group knew could make the same kind of joke a me, a problem which i also found online when speaking to people. due to repeating the same mistake over and over, no matter how many youtube social skill video i tried to implement, i would always offend someone in history, or outside of the classroom. i'd either be faced with eye glaring across at me with pure disgust, or just the silence that corroded the positive atmosphere i wa trying to create for myself and others to share. i never felt lucid in my body language, like my whole body wa being constricted of it oxygen and i felt the need to act constantly. i hated being ignored, i never understood why i wa ignored. eventually, i just numbed all of my emotion towards society, sacrificing what little ability to empathise i already had because i feared getting hurt.

the rejection i experienced in the classroom, coupled with the teacher finding out and threatening to exclude me, gave me a form of aversion to both people in authority and pre-established social group where i actively avoid both type of social interaction fearing i might offend someone. i never perceived or structured my joke to be considered a offensive, they just made people feel uncomfortable because of how they went against the social norm that were there long before i showed my face in the group setting. the more stoic 'jock' type of kid would make joke about how awkward i wa and i'd hear people mutter offensive slurs. some girl in my psychology class spread rumour around that i wa mentally handicapped at the top of their voice and i had to hear these thought spiral around my head constantly. eventually, the fear of rejection and being considered to be stupid became so strong that i sacrificed my dream of studying economics at university to instead start an online business because i never considered myself a being capable of fitting in, or gaining the inspiration to work hard alongside other people i considered were always judging me.

i began to see other people a being fake, coming up with multiple theory in my mind of why i would be left out whilst everyone around me could thrive socially. eventually, i decided to avoid every social interaction where i have to act like myself out of the fear of being rejected. i inflicted loneliness upon myself a a punishment for continuously offending people/ coming across a weird. i even come across a being weird and offensive on site such a this a lot of the time, where conversation don't flow and i feel disconnected from my own body. i've deleted account and made new one on this website out of fear that i would start an argument and have to back up my claim using logic. i used to consider myself to be a very logical 'phlegmatic' guy, but now i struggle to even trust my own opinion on thing and my intuition ha became a crutch that i want rid of. i wish i could just fit in like everyone else and be social.

2583,"i haven't been diagnosed with anxiety. for more than 4 years, i have been experiencing neck tremors. it primarily happens i'm when i'm talking to someone and get nervous. it's like some buildup rapidly happens inside my brain and then a burst of neck tremor come out (rapid rotation left-right). it doesn't happen all the time and depends on certain things. sometimes it's almost non-existing, and sometimes it's unbearable. also, when i'm eating in front of someone, it happens like 99% times. additionally, tremor will much likely happen if i'm sitting or turning my head. it rarely happens when i'm talking, and more often when i'm  listening to someone. if i'm tired or physically exhausted, it almost disappears. it started when wa i wa transferred to different school in 10th grade, because i wa nervous and probably because i started drinking coffee at that time (i don't drink coffee anymore tho, and almost never drank it beforehand. at the start it wa different, more like constant twitching of all body and not a neck buildup and tremor, and now it's a like vicious circle). also, prior to that it happened for the first time when i wa passing my exam and got extremely anxious (my head shaked really bad, before that i never experienced something like that, also drank coffee that day). before that, when i would get nervous, my body would just turn red or something, but now it's primarily the neck thing). neck tremor can happen even if i'm by myself, but got really nervous for some reason. also, i don't really feel anxiety and not scared to talk to people, but then tremor spontaneously happens and my neck tense really hard. for this 4 year i developed many coping mechanisms, so i can live with it, but a a mentioned before, i can't normally eat in front of people and nervous to perform in front of a crowd, or sometimes talking to someone. and also there is one spot inside the back-left of my neck that really hurt because of the constant tension. is there ant way to cure this? maybe some light medication like magnesium?",anxiety

this ha been happening every once in a while and it kinda weirding me out. ill find myself forcefully refusing to think or perceive reality, kinda just sit there, thinking of nothing, feeling nothing. i dissociate a lot but this is probably not a simple dissociative state because i do get bored. i instinctively turn on my phone and look at reddit. i see the first post- it a picture with some text. i look at the image yet before i can read or understand what is in the post, i instinctively scroll down. i disturb my own perception. i stop myself before i can seriously perceive the post and i dont know why.
last time it happened, *after* i started thinking about it i realised that i had a feeling that if i let my mind relax (which would happen if i focused on reading the post), i would instantly start feeling that weird, distanced sort of fear/anxiety. (so i subconsciously stopped myself before that happened)
a few week before that, it happened again because reading my diary note kept triggering excitement and i felt instinctively annoyed with that emotion. (again, i saw the text but subconsciously kept looking away before recognising words)
even before that- it wa because perceiving a dumb movie kept triggering sth i called a disgusting sense of dumb happiness. (the feeling surprised me at the beginning of the movie and i instinctively shut up the entirety of my emotion in response and watched the movie without really feeling anything later on)

worth mentioning, i dont mind being happy nor excited normally. i do also feel that fear/anxiety on a regular basis, especially before therapy and in the morning but most of the time it sort of distanced. i can feel anxious but dont overthink. my thought are calm, kinda separated from emotion whatsoever. it just weird.

my paternal grandma is alive and healthy and life about an hour away, so i visit her often. yesterday, when i went out to lunch with her, i would compulsively pull my phone out and type down thing she'd say because i wa terrified i would forget, and i took a ton of picture of the most mundane thing for the same reason. throughout the whole day, i found it really difficult to be in the moment because i just kept being anxious about losing memory (and losing her too, i think). it kind of felt like when your heart drop when you get bad news but it just lingered for the whole day..

2676,"i (28) have been with my wife (also 28) for almost 10 year (married for soon to be 3 years) who i very much love. she ha pretty bad anxiety, low self-esteem, (especially with bodyweight/appearance), and likely period of depression. she's seen a therapist in the past but, stopped for a while, and ha now started seeing one again. she is not taking any medication, a big barrier for her is the fear of weight gain. a little more about our relationship, we rarely fight, argue infrequently, and if we ever think it's going to get to the point of yelling, we take a break, cool off and reconvene when we've had some time to calm down, and think rationally. we generally communicate well (with the exception of below) and i'd say overall we have a fairly healthy relationship. the one common theme that seems to pop-up generally stem from her anxiety/low self-esteem... to be clear i am not blaming her or her anxiety, nor is it the sole contributor. i have severe adhd that can, and doe 100% contribute. i have a fairly decent understanding of anxiety a far a what it is, it clinical presentation, how debilitating it can be, etc., however, that doe not necessarily equate to knowing how to respond and what not to do/say. hence the reason i am here seeking advice from people who may have been/be in similar situation on either side. 

her anxiety ha worsened in the past couple of year and it's becoming harder and harder to talk to her about my frustration or how i'm feeling about something. when i try to, she more often than not end up crying, blaming herself saying it's all her fault, that she's a terrible person, and/or she hate herself. she's not being manipulative, she genuinely blame herself. those conversation end with me feeling incredibly guilty for making her so upset, but also worried because of how negatively she talk about herself. she is not suicidal, nor doe she have a history of si, but it genuinely scare me because i think we are all capable of getting to that point. if she's doing something wrong or missed something, i'll say something like, ""have you considered trying xyz, or have asked her if i can show her an alternative way."" and she'll respond a if i just criticized her. i'm finding myself bottling thing up more and more rather than talking to her about it because of the above and find that i sometimes can't control my impulsivity and something slip out in a passive aggressive, or just aggressive way. it's neither healthy for me to do so, nor is it fair to either of us. 

the most recent contentious issue ha been intimacy/our sex-life. the only time she initiate is if she's been drinking. i don't think she's initiated while sober in over 8 or 9 months. when i try, she'll either pause to think about it, which at that point i say if you have to think about it, it's likely a no, a straight no, or ""not tonight, but tomorrow (that doesn't happen).""  on the off chance that she say yes, it end up being pitty sex which i hate. i've gotten to the point where i've stopped trying because i'm tired of being told no/pitty sex. i've brought a lack of a sex-life/intimacy broadly in the past and she blamed herself which ultimately lead me to feel guilty. we did eventually talk about it and she told me that it's not that she doesn't want to but her anxieties/insecurities make it difficult (i.e., she will notice her body and then she can't get out of her head his fat she think she is). we talked about some thing to try like adding music, using candles, and some other things, and they seemed to work for a while, but that doesn't seem to be the case anymore. 

although i know this isn't true, my own insecurities/anxieties come into play making me feel like i'm not desirable, she's not attracted to me anymore, lonely, or that she no longer love me. i want to bring this up to her but i'm just at a loss about how to talk to her about it, or really any frustration that she could perceive a criticism. i don't know how to approach the conversation, start the conversation, what to say that accurately describes my feeling while also not coming off a judgemental or angry. i genuinely want to work with her to id any trigger a well a strategy we both can use for situation like this. im not looking for, nor do i expect her to be perfect, i really just want to be able to communicate my feelings/frustrations to her, not leave a conversation feeling guilty/worried, and to minimize any negative feeling she ha about herself. any advice, strategy that worked for y'all, or suggestion you are willing to offer are very much appreciated. 

thank you! 

tldr; i am seeking advice on how to better communicate with my wife who ha anxiety/low self-esteem/insecurities and blame herself when i try to talk to her about my frustrations/how i am feeling about something (i.e., lacking sex life/intimacy).",anxiety

2678,"hello everyone, i'm not sure who will read this but, i feel so lost right now... i'm not sure what to say but just wanted to get this off of my chest. i'm a senior in college right now and an english major and also a writing tutor. in high school i wa the top of my class grade-wise and always excelled when writing papers. i continued to excel for my first two year of college, maintaining a high gpa and managing to produce high quality paper despite turning them in always at the last minute due to lot of procrastinating and anxiety. 

then, following the pandemic and returning to campus for my junior year to live by myself, i fell into an anxious-depressive spiral that completely paralyzed me and sucked away every scrap of self-worth that i ever possessedi've hated myself internally since middle school for being socially awkward and bad at math and inadequate in many areasbut now these thought have become impossible to break away from, and have actively persisted in controlling me and derailing my performance in school. 

after leaving my fall semester last year with 7 unfinished paper and 3 incompletes, i took a medical leave of absence to explore medication (currently not on anything right now) and to recover my mental health while undertaking the task of completing my unfinished work. it wa a massive struggle. i somehow scraped by and turned in the paper during the midway point of this current semester. then, i started to believe in myself again, just a little bit. i started to believe i wa capable of writing againsomething which had always been a source of pride and confidence for me in the past. 

until i started falling into the exact same anxious-depressive spiral again on my new papers, becoming le and le motivated to power through each successive one. when i received glowing grade on several of these papers, i felt fantasticbut the feeling slowly faded each time another paper and deadline crept up. tonight, i felt like i might have reached my breaking pointagain. after week of having avoided even looking at the text for my paper, pushing away the anxiety and the feeling of paralysis, they all came back to bite me in the end. i couldn't get myself out of bed over the weekend and i couldn't get myself to sit down and focus on completing one task at a time. compound that with other assignment for other class and with my tutoring job on campus and i have been a total mess.

i feel like the biggest fraud to ever exist. the fact that i pas myself off a a tutor, a someone who can help others with their writing struggles, yet who struggle so much internally that she cannot even begin to articulate her own argument in a sensible and cohesivelet alone timelymanner is appalling. i feel like telling my supervisor that i am not qualified for the job i wa selected for. i feel like dropping my major and saying i don't know the first thing about writing. i used to thrive off of the feeling of adrenaline from last-minute late-night papers, but now i lose steam and become utterly terrified of even approaching the task of writing. i feel so sickhate myself so greatly for having failed and resigned myself to failurebut i simply don't know what to do anymore. it only seems to be getting worse and worse, despite counseling. over winter break i am going to try medication for depression/anxiety again, when i have time to deal with the side-effects.

i apologize for the rambling text. if anyone ha some word of advice or support that they wouldn't mind sharing, i would be sincerely grateful.",anxiety

2681,"i have gone through panic disorder in my life .. but now a day it doesn't feel that what is affecting me is panic disorder ... because i no longer have panic attack and obsessive thought of doom are rarely in my life.  + 1 for me. 

my thing is the fucking tension build up ... and sometimes in hand with that lack.of energy and focus. every week i have to do at least one deep tissue massage and i always have stress . i consciously do not worry about anything , i have a pretty good.life. in other word it been a long time that i felt this underlying ""base"" is not psychological.

 iam on a journey the last 2 year in functional medicine and although there isn't a root cause identified ... supporting my system with a cocktail of nutrient ha indeed.helped . .. but this post isn't about functional medicine treatment . 

what frustrates me the most is that it feel like some key natural compound like cbd make my body react in tension ... i've felt an increase a if my body decides that relaxing is bad. cbd u just an example but same ha happened with tryptophan and others . how do i accept this  ... what sense doe this have ?? 

it feel like iam in this vicious cycle that my hormone are affected by stress , and stress maintains my hormone in depletion .. and by hormone iam including the very basic of then all in mental health : serotonin and dopamine.

then again , this distracts me ... all the energy up and down , the massage , the difficulty to do excercice because i never know when i will have.the stamen put me in a position to always second thought or avoid compromise for the future as.i never know how i may feel that day and pressuring myself to social stuff or protocol that's when i can enter.in a panic. 

it's more ups then down ... but it's so frustrated that i feel i have identified top quality botanical that can help me ...and i sometimes feel my body say no.  why doe the sub conscious challenge me like this ...i don't have a doubt i'll be better... a few year back (10+) just mentioning panic in a conversation , or closing my eye in a relaxation session triggered panic .. even taking a benzo triggered panic. all that is history yet the base still stick . 

if i had normal amount of dopamine / serotonin even listening to music would be a gentle breeze .. i've experienced that very rarely but i know that those contrast exists and it so fucking easy to go on recreational trip and the like and actually fucking enjoy them. .. that and many other scenario .

after that incident, there wa tightness and heaviness in my chest area and i had difficulty breathing. i drank water, did deep breathing technique and all but nothing worked.

i still have chest pain and don't know how to cope with this feeling. i googled for some method but nothing worked.

18f and i have quite bad health anxiety with numerous symptom that i think are mostly caused by stress (and a couple of medical condition on top of that).

the majority of my anxiety is focused on my health and it's pretty much taken over my thought 24/7. i've had health anxiety since i wa 12, when i could barely eat solid food for about a year because i felt like i couldn't swallow it (i started taking lorazepam with meal and it went away by the time i wa 13). 

the symptom i've dealt with in the past are air hunger, chest pain, shakiness, blurry vision, head pressure, insomnia, muscle twitching etc etc etc and right now i'm dealing with my leg feeling like they're burning when i walk in the heat, heart rate issues, and ton of weird eye problem with no organic cause. i have two (non-psychosomatic) medical issue which make me lose my hair and give me pelvic floor issues, which doesn't help my anxiety. i'm especially anxious about cancer and in my stupid brain, everything could be an indication of cancer.

i've been having a really hard time, especially over the last year, dealing with these symptom and living my life normal and would love any recommendation to start improving my mental health. should i start with a therapist / psychiatrist? would medication be a good idea?

i wa a hyperactive kid with adhd and a lisp growing up, so i wa bullied a lot. when i went to college i had a hard time making friends, i started to shut down when i wa around new people, i never had this issue in high school. eventually i started to drink and thing improved immensely. i became the person that everyone wanted at there parties, i made a lot of friend and yadda yadda, fast forward now im 3 year sober. end up alcohol made me hypomanic and hypomanic me is a lot of fun. my social anxiety ha greatly improved, sometimes too much, when my adhd hit i can be pretty hyperactive. i still; struggle with anxiety at large party but overall it's improved.

thursday me and his family are going to minnesota to visit his extended family for three days. i've never met them before. i just want to feel comfortable around his family. my personality is so much bigger and brighter then what im able to show them. i feel like i completely shut down, i feel cold and distant.

a few year ago i wa diagnosed bipolar, i'm currently trying to find a therapist because i also have a lot of resentment towards my parent thats dragging me down. i'll have a klonopin on the trip but i dont feel like that ha ever helped my social anxiety.

im at a loss and would like some advice",anxiety
2708,"for the past 2 week day my iphone storage ha been going up and down between 20 gb to nearly 32 gb out of a 64 gb storage for no reason whatsoever at all, and yea it an iphone xr. and yes it is updated to the latest update, now for my ipad air on the other hand ha been going crazy recently. idk whats going on but the icloud backup literally wont back up, it been at 20 or 17 gb before but now is up to 32 gb and at one point went up to 50 gb on a 256 gb storage. and it say that apps are taking up the most space despite the fact that ive offloaded all the apps i dont even use, the only three apps i use are youtube, discord, and procreate. however it also tell me to delete some photo and note even i have 101 photo on my ipad and about 253 photo on my phone, even though my phone ha never told me to delete some photo before. and i wa trying to post about this before but my redd account got suspended for 3 day for no reason. so i really need to know what this is? is this a virus? malware? hacker? or something else that i shouldnt be worried about or should be? and how do i fix this? please help",anxiety
2709,"so to make this short, a couple of month ago i (m21) broke up w my girlfriend (f21). the reason behind this wa bc i had severe anxiety that had me questioning my feeling and the relationship a a whole. (we were long-distance so i feel like that played a role into it)

now, the reason this all started wa bc i used to be interested in this other girl right before i met my now-ex. i never really thought about the whole thing a a whole until one night. i wa watching the walking dead and i somehow remembered that this other girl liked the show. from there, my mind told me you didnt tell your gf you used to talk to this other girl. after that, i immediately went into fight or flight and started to get severe anxiety (i guess bc i saw that a a threat to the relationship which is silly thinking about it now). i ended up partially telling my gf about it and i felt temporarily relieved. i didnt tell her other detail (bc of fear lol) so the anxiety/overthinking remained. fast forward to a couple of weeks, i ended up telling her everything but it wa too late by then. my thought were caught in this loop of overthinking and anxiety.

this other girl and i go to the same church so i used to feel so anxious seeing her. driving by her house (or even street) filled me w so much anxiety. anything related to her made me so anxious.

fast forward to now, i recently remembered this other girl i used to talk to about a year ago. i ended up ghosting her. couple of day ago i wa on facebook and my mind told me you could look her up if you wanted to. same thing happened a last time, instant fight or flight w severe anxiety. i ended up looking at her account and now it the same situation a before. it hard to stop thinking about her, my mind start reminding me of thing related to her and start connecting unrelated thing to her too.

im not sure whats wrong w me, ive been like this for a couple of month now. i feel like the first experience traumatized by brain into seeing anything that i feel guilty about a dangerous hence the fight or flight response. intrusive thought make me super anxious and make me feel guilty. i'm also dealing w obsessive thought such a my ex, those other girl (first girl not a much a before), and just thing that i've done that make me feel guilty.

ive been going to talk therapy for a couple of week now (ive seen some progress like not being too anxious relating to the first girl). but im not sure this is gonna completely heal whats going on w me.

i know this all sound so silly and childish. i wish i could just tell my brain to stop seeing all of this a bad and just let go and move one lol. anyone know what this could be? should i see a specialist of any kind? thoughts?",anxiety

2716,"i graduated recently. i got a really good job a a software developer and i've been working there for about 4 month now.

i had my first performance review and it wasn't great. they mentioned 2 issues.   
1. i wa writing code that wasn't always perfectly complete or had stuff left in there that i had used for debugging purpose  
2. that i asked poor quality question  


the first one didn't bother me a much a i know what incident they were referring to and simply double checking my work could yield better results. my issue is with the question thing. 

i know i don't always ask the best questions. i know sometimes they are basic or stupid. i don't try to ask thing that are very simple, but sometimes i get stuck on something or i need to be reminded of something or i figure it's just quicker to try asking if i have tried finding a solution with no luck.

idk, hearing that one really made me upset. i know what they are considering a poor quality question, but i have a hard enough time trying to figure out all their system and it just frustrating. i'll try to reduce the amount of question i ask because i don't want them to think i don't value their time. but i don't know what i'm supposed to do if i get stuck on something simple.

you know those time when you are trying to figure something out and the answer is staring you in the face, but you don't notice. and then when someone point it out, you feel feel stupid? i guess i won't feel stupid if there's nobody to point it out but i'd like to not be stuck figuring out something so simple for so long.

this kind of turned into a rant but i genuinely don't know what i am supposed to do if i get stuck like that. i am worried that me not asking might make my performance dip even lower. maybe i'm overthinking it but it not impossible. this is my first job and my first performance review and already it's going poorly :/",anxiety

2719,"this is kind of long story since there's a lot of history behind my experience, so thank to anyone who took the time to read. 

about 4 year ago when i wa 23, (i'm 27m right now) i wa having sharp headache in very specific part of my head and i read once that someone who had experienced that happened to be having an aneurysm. that caused me to have probably the worst anxiety attack in my life. i began having pain in other part of my body too around that time. i became a bit manic and wound up going to an urgent care doctor who had a ct scan machine. they checked my head out and said that i wa fine and they didn't find anything. at the time i wa following a ketogenic diet, with one meal a day fasting, and drinking a large cold brew coffee every morning. i didn't know that this wa bad for your stomach.  anyway the doctor asked me if i had taken advil for the headaches, i said yes i wa taking the recommended dosage every day, and he told me it would be fine to double that to alleviate the symptoms. so i did that. then not too long later after taking 1600 mg of advil (or something like that) on an empty stomach everyday with black coffee, i felt a painful swelling in my abdomen on my left side.

this wa the first time i had ever felt this so i wa pretty panicked.  wa also feeling major fatigue, peripheral pain in my arm and legs, and overall just feeling terrible. i went to a different urgent care doctor after that and he said i had gastritis. the diet he recommended didn't really help, and from searching online i found what i wa feeling could leaky gut syndrome. there wasn't a lot of study behind it online but the diet that i found in article for that actually helped a lot. at least temporarily. 

over time i had experienced a bunch of weird symptom despite the gastritis being better, like muscle twitching, mild sore pain around my mid back and neck, heavy fatigue, and mild nausea. i didn't have insurance at the time so i wa just carrying on praying it would just stop and that i didn't have cancer or something.   

fast forward to april 2020, at this point i'm 25, and have gained a bit of weight. the health issue i were experiencing made it difficult to follow a low carb diet that always kept my weight down, and to stay motivated to work out. however, april 2020 gave me a lot of free time a it did everyone, and i started focusing on my stress and got back on a good diet. keto again but this time no advil.  for the month from april 2020 to august 2020, i wa feeling great. i lost around 30 pounds, and hadn't had any health issue ir weird symptom anymore. i fell off the diet after agust though, and then by october i gained a few pound back and then one day i woke up and felt very dizzy, and my heart kept beating weird. i also wa shirt of breath, and it felt like there wa something inside my lung preventing me from filling my lung completely. i just couldn't quite get full breath which wa very uncomfortable.  

i went to the er, and they did bloodwork, and chest xrays, and found nothing. i just kept living with it and working with this for the following month until jan 2021.   

finally i had health insurance again. i got a primary care physician, they send me to a cardiologist, i had a full work up, stress tests, ekg, and ultrasound or whatever the test is to look at the structure of your heart. they said i wa experiencing pvc's but they went away while i wa active during the stress test. they told me they didn't know why i wa having the pvcs, but probably weight gain (at this point i've gained 30 pound back, around 230 lbs, for a 5'8"" male. for the following month i start doing thing that i enjoy and trying to eat at least a little better, and exercise more, and the pvc never cane back. but there were still some issues... 

my lung capacity improved over time, but not entirely. i still get out of breath sometimes and i don't know why. granted i could be out of shape, but at 5'8"" and 230, i know thats over weight but i have family thats way larger and seem to function without these issues. 

the g.i. problem would keep coming and going, and i woukd have bout where i would wake up and be dizzy, and weak, and always seemed to happened when my stomach wasn't right. and i would also feel sharp pain inside of my chest that i wa worried wa cancer (another thing to note, i worry about cancer a lot because i work with pesticides, and grew up around cigarette smoke indoors, and vaped a lot through my early 20s). 

i saw my doctor about  this stuff but i've fallen into this cycle of seeing my doctor, my doctor prescribing med without diagnosing cause if the pain inside me, and then switching insurance at the end of the year, switching doctors, and having them do the same. none have ordered ct scans, or sent me to a g.i. specialist. american healthcare, particularly in ca suck right now. 

last fast forward to last friday, i had been doing alright and feeling alright for the past year. some pain popping up hear and there, and still out of breath but i try not to let it get to me. i always did have this looming ""when is the other show going to drop"" if the pain and breathlessness wa undiagnosed cancer or something. i also have a friend whose mother suddenly passed away from undiagnosed lung cancer that exacerbated these thoughts.  last friday i developed some back pain on my middle left. then throughtout the day it wa spreading to my stomach area on the left, and just gnawing at me. by friday night i wa feeling really fatigued, and weak, and nauseous again. saturday morning i woke uo in even more pain and weakness, but my girlfriend and i had ticket to la comic con, and i kept telling myself it wa just anxiety. i kept wondering all day, did i have pancreatitis? wa it pancreatic cancer this whole time? did it spread from my lungs? is it my kidneys? i tried to keep those thought out of my head, and i kinda felt better throughout the day but not completely.  
sunday/monday a bit better, tried to do some stretching, and went to the gym, tried to eat stomach healthy stuff, high and fiber and what not, and i wa okay but still not feeling well. today, tuesday, i woke up much earlier than normal and could not go back to sleep due to the gnawing on my left side, inside of me. i felt really sick and nauseous, peripheral pain in my arm and legs, constantly using the bathroom with not much happening, and the pain radiating around my back and feeling hot. i had to call out of work and wound up going to that same urgent care doctor from 4 year ago with the ct scan machine. unfortunately the machine wasn't working today, but besides that, i had bloodwork done, ultrasound of my kidneys, liver, pancreas, spleen, and a urinalysis. everything came back fine. they gave me a ""g.i. cocktail"" which wa a mixture of milanta, some other sruff and numbing agents. the doctor said that it would go through my system and numb my gastrointestinal track, and if i stopped feeling pain, they could confirm that it wa g.i. related at least. unfortunately the pain didn't stop at all. the pain to begin with wa moderate, and maybe a 6 or 7 out of 10, but still too difficult to function normally with. they spoke to my pcp, and i'm going to see a gastroenterologist soon, and i'm going back for the ct scan of my chest and abdomen next week when their machine work again, but anyway what i'm really here to ask is this: 

besides the gastrointestinal stuff, could all of the other pain really be from anxiety? ha any one else here really experienced this to that level? sharp recurring chest pains, deep fatigue, constant nausea, random nerve pain throughout my body, pain radiating around my back to my chest and left side? now that i'm home from the doctor, half of me is glad that they found nothing, but on the other hand i can't even lay down and relax comfortably because i just feel so sick and like my body is failing on me. half of me keep telling myself ""you're fine, it's anxiety, you know this, you've been through it before"" and the other half of me keep thinking ""this is the worst you've felt so far, it's probably more than anxiety, am i going to feel better? how am i going to make it through work tomorrow, the doctor found nothing and i have no excuse to call out, they haven't looked at my lung or stomach yet, i probably have cancer"".

2748,since august ive felt like nothing wa real. it so scary to me. it feel like im not in my body but then it also feel like im trapped inside my body. lately ive been getting really bad. i feel like my emotion are numb. im never happy anymore. i genuinely cant tell if it anxiety or not. i cant leave my house or drive because i literally panic every time. i dont even understand why. ive noticed that when i talk sometimes i get like.. idk if youd call it lightheaded but the feeling i get make me want to panic is weird. a big trigger for me is feeling that feeling in my head. it almost like my head get heavy and it feel like im going to pas out. ive never actually passed out but that feeling make me feel anxious. ive just been feeling so out of it lately. im also having really bad death anxiety it all i think about. even my dream give me anxiety. i just want to feel like me again. i dont even know if this is anxiety or if i should be worried.,anxiety

2750,"i need to rant. i know this is going to take time. im seeing a therapist but i just feel really alone right now. 

about a year ago my wife and i went through a big transition in our lives. we moved to a new state and started new job together. 

life seemed good despite many financial challenges. our relationship had the same light and adventure it always had, however she started saying thing like i feel like i missed out on experiencing dating a an adult (we first got together in college, i wa her first everything). she started talking about taking a solo trip, which i am in support of but honestly it make me feel anxious. shes said she feel like shes lost herself in the relationship and isnt sure if shes in love anymore. 

our relationship is really great, we have so much fun and there so much love. she only ever said these thing if she wa feeling particularly low. ive always been supportive of her and kept myself available for her but i never understood how she could feel this way.  

i started to feel like i wasnt good enough, i began suffering from really bad sexual performance anxiety. no matter what i would try and do to make the relationship better the sexual frustration put a heavy weight on both of us. 

i had never had these problem before, the love would flow and we would vibe so well

this summer she expressed to me (during a particularly stressful couple of months) that she had developed feeling for one of our guy friends. i wa crushed. i became an anxious mess. cry at work, i felt like my life wa falling apart. i felt like i didnt know who i even was. 

since then she told me that she had misinterpreted her feeling and she wished she hadnt told me. we almost broke up, i looked forward to my life with this person. shes the best partner i could have ever hoped for. or so at least i thought. 

she wasnt the least bit supportive to me during a really anxious/ depressive time. telling me i had to figure this out on my own when i told her i felt really alone and i need some love and support. 

since this episode my mind is constantly worried that im not doing something right for her. ive become scared of sex, correlating my lack of performance with her feeling for other men. ive become paranoid who is she talking to? why is her phone buzzing so much? i bet shes texting our friend. she doesnt love me. she feel stuck with me i cant get image of her with other men out of my head somebody else could love her better she never cheated. 

this whole ordeal opened up a part of my mind that never showed itself in the history of our relationship. a scared child, fear of abandonment maybe. like i said im seeing a therapist but i just wanna fix this shit now so i can love her the way we used to love. there wa a point when we considered couple therapy but we bailed and decided to see our own therapist first. i might bring up the discussion for couple therapy again. 

idk what im looking for posting this. i just feel so alone and scared. im almost 30 and i feel so uncertain. everything feel so permanent and heavy. it used to be u against the world. i want that feeling back more than anything. 

this ended up being a lot longer than i intended, thank you for reading",anxiety

i inspected the stain, i believe it wa a blood smear, it wasnt a big stain or extremely eye catching, very faded but i saw it, i then wiped it off with tissue to see if it wa wet or dry, it came off easily but i couldnt tell if it wa fresh or not.

another friend mentioned the party and that my best friend may be there so i should come. thats great but then my brain go to oh, why didnt my best friend tell me? will they tell me? i live way closer to the party then they do are they gonna mention it day of? are they gonna mention it when they come over to hang out next week?

1. this wont matter in 5 years
2. a good friend wouldnt hold this over my best friend head, so dont.

2788," we are both student and during her studies, she developed severe panic attacks, social anxiety and anxiety disorder which caused her severe stomach cramps. so she struggled a lot with her study and often liked to be alone, but she had different interests, painting, activism, fitness, healthy eating, anime... every time she had an obligation or a stressful situation she would take a xanax and get it done and then go back to her hobby and thing that excite her. but after we returned after corona online year and a half lecture back live to the faculty i noticed that she behaves distant and disinterested. at first, i thought it wa just because we hadn't seen each other in person for so long, so she wa getting used to the stressful environment. but her roommate noticed the same. she no longer had panic attack and anxiety, it wa easier for her to socialize and it wa easier for her to fulfil her duty at the faculty, but most of the time she wa disinterested. and she repaired her relationship with her family who never understood her anxiety and always expected the best from her. but she stopped doing almost all her hobbies, started smoking, spends most of her free time watching tv and started to live quite unhealthily (she ha a serious health condition of muscle deterioration that requires her to regularly exercise which she doesn't do anymore). a if she ha built wall around herself or a if she life in her own bubble and if anyone challenge her she just retreat without any reaction. and she just stopped enjoying herself. it is difficult to explain her change.

and so this week the two of u sat down and talked. so she admitted to me that she is worried because this fall she got some new medicine instead of xanax which she ha to take regularly, it's the smallest possible dose, but it affect her a lot (sorry, i don't remember the name of that new medicine). and that she is worried that the way she behaves because of the medicine would drive her friend away because her roommate criticized her for her behaviour. but even then sometimes she doe not immediately understand or notice criticism towards herself in some situations. she also admitted to me that she ha lost interest in her former hobbies, that her libido is low and that she generally feel numb. that she often say something without thinking how that come across a cold and wrong, or in her word "" feeling whatever"". so she asked me to hold on with her and not to blame her if she say or do something like that to me. but she doesn't know what to do because she is aware of the problem when she look back on some situations, but that she can't go back to the old way where she often had severe anxiety and panic attacks. but still, when she think about stressful situation she get cramp and ha nightmare so it doesn't even help her completely.

i've done a lot of research (thanks to all the poster on this sub) and see we have a few options. we have been traveling for the past few month and still are, hence do not have the ability to see a family doctor/gp in person. have recognized unsettled-ness due to traveling is one of the cause of anxiety, a well a work, life stuff, etc. my so met with an online therapist this week, the first session seemed to help but they are still really struggling and almost out of ativans.

2845,"anxiety can cause thing to feel a way they are not. you just need to remember that thing are not that way. your anxiety doe not speak for you. you speak for you. if you feel out of control then remind yourself that you create your thought and experiences. anxiety is just another thought or experience, but think of these thought or experience are like an animal you can put into a cage. some animal are soft and fluffy, others are mean and bitey. but you have a leash and can put them in their cage when you want to. they don't roam around without your say so. so tell them to fuck off and get in the cage.

once you realize that you are the warden and not the prisoner then you can start to feel a sense of control. panic attack or anxiety attack are a lot like when the inmates, or in this case caged animals, get rowdy. you may think there's a danger because of the noise coming from the cell block, but these animals, prisoners, thoughts, are all locked behind their cage still. they can make noise, rattle the cell door, bark, reach their hand out the hole in the door, but they cannot free themselves. you hold the keys. you can choose to walk around the cage and listen a they bark, bite, yell, or you can walk away. each ha it strengths. walking away is removing yourself from the situation that's causing your anxiety. it may vastly improve once you do that. you may also feel like it is prolonging your healing or avoiding it - because in a sense, you are avoiding it. that's okay though. removing negative emotion is never a bad thing. however, the alternative is to stay in the cell block. watch a the animal act out, understand that they are doing this, that it may have been triggered by something or not, but regardless they cannot be freed without your help. would you willingly crash your car into a mailbox if given the choice between that or staying in your lane and carrying on down the street? i think the vast majority of u would stay on the road. the same thing applies here. you have these thought that are caged away. they cannot hurt you unless you let them out. remind them that you are the warden, you hold the keys, that they can drivel on for a long a they like but they won't be let out. soon you'll find that they start to bark less, they put their teeth away, the cage slowly stop rattling. eventually, it is these prisoner or animal that come to realize they don't have control over the situation, you do.",anxiety

so 6 year ago we had our first child, so naturally, good quality sleep wa off the menu. i then got a regular cold, nothing too crazy. sometime during this period, while at work i noticed this new feeling that i wa going to fall off my chair in the cafeteria. it wa worse on hightop chairs/barstools, but could really be any chair with leg (booths were fine). it felt like i couldnt trust the chair to hold me up and would suddenly flinch/jump a for a split second it would feel like i wa falling to the ground. 

my son is now 6 and 5 month ago we had our 3rd son (i know, i know, we need to buy a tv or something!). so again good, long period of solid sleep have been hard to find. this sensation ha come and gone over the years. sometimes i will forget all about it, other time it really bad and im practically clinging on to the edge of the table a i sit. im sure when i have this sudden falling sensation i must flinch to the point other people notice.

i'll try to make this short,
about 10 day ago i wa laying in bed at night with my girlfriend watching funny youtube vids and laughing pretty hard, when all of a sudden i wa hit with a huge wave of heartburn like ive never experienced before. of course, i wa truly concerned a this ha never happened to me before (never felt heartburn at all tbh) but tried to brush it off, only to be met with wave of heartburn throughout the entire night and the inevitable extremely sore throat the next day.

this cycle of nightime heartburn and daily sore throat continued for a few days, and slowly more symptom like tiredness, almost complete lack of appetite and more recently also stomach ache specifically in the upper left abdomen and nausea popped up..

i wa terrified, so i met with my gp a week ago, which didnt seem too concerned, basically shrugged it off and said it wa reflux or something, but gave me a prescription for nexium (esomeprazole) 20mg 2x a day for 30 days. he also ordered me to do a comprehensive blood test (i haven't done one since 2004 when i wa 4 for some reason).

i start taking the nexium, and the next day (last thursday) i do the blood test. result come back not good.

i have very low iron (58 micg/dl), pretty low transferrin saturation (15%). hemoglobin seems good though, and so are most of the other stuff. 

so a of the last, what, 4-5 days? ive been an absolute wreck. physically and mentally. i have latent iron deficiency, i'm tired constantly, zero appetite, upper left abdominal aches, nausea. been taking nexium and it only helped my heartburn and sore throat which are gone.

here is where my anxiety come in. these symptom fit stomach cancer to a t. i'm terrified. ive read all about it the past 10 days, and every symptom match mine... tiredness, stomach aches, low iron a a result of internal bleeding from tumor, lack of appetite, nausea... everything's down bad, im so scared of dying from this horrible disease. im way too young :( im literally cry at work right now...

but really, i don't wanna judge nobody, never. i do want to give you some tip i've learned from the most anxious person i've met in my life, which was.. myself, lol.

firstly, every day that you're still breathing is a new day for a new beginning. once you've learned something new today, it mean you've applied it somehow into your life. which mean you've changed. which means, you're not who you were yesterday. you're strong, better, smarter, more experienced.  
now when you've blown it into say a bad relationship, a job, you've dropped off college, your parent hated you, threw you off the house. your brother abused you, whatever it is - that doe not define who you are.

look here, if i make a mistake, doe it mean that's who i am? no it doesn't. there are variable which have made me do whatever it is i did. but i'm not the mistake i've made, i'm not a failure because i've dropped out of college. i'm not a failure because i've not been able to talk to that girl or guy. that's the mindset change i'd love all of you to receive.

a baby try to walk, their parent are encouraging them to walk. the baby fall and that's a disaster to them. so they burst in tears, and what do the parent do? they encourage them to make the same step, knowingly they'll fall. ego's smashed, feeling are hurt, you feel terrible ( i assume so, i personally don't remember the first time i walked lol) but your parent are there pushing you to fail. they literally want you to fail, but why?  
in order to.. learn! to learn how to walk properly, how to stand without falling. when a baby speaks, nobody's laughing at their pronunciation and say ""buhahaha. he/she hasn't said mom properly!!"" no, they've compassion, love, they adore the baby, respect it, help them learn.

""itay this isn't a course about parenthood"" no it isn't, but why not be supportive that way towards yourself?

when you go on a date and you meet that guy or girl, and they say something really, genuinely weird. you'd not go with ""pfff, what a weird guy this itay guy is"" you'd have compassion ""aww, that wa so sweet, hehe"".  
why can't we do that towards ourselves?  
why is it that life is over because you're 25 and failed college? 30 and got divorced? 40 and your girlfriend left you, you failed university, brother left you from your life, had a financial crash and you're at the literal street.   
isn't every day a new page to change? isn't it a new opportunity to make a difference in your life?  
what if we'd deal with the anxiety we currently do have?

i can testify from my own life, that sitting through discomfort is the way to rid anxiety off. the moment you want to escape the situation, no no no. you stay right there. i don't care how sweaty you get, and your heartbeat go madly fast. you feel dizzy, like you're about to collapse. you might even feel like you're dying, but that's right when you recognize where you're at:  
""alright. i'm anxious, this isn't pleasing me at all. i'm aware of it. what's causing me this anxiety?"" and if it's a group of people, if it's a person in front of you - remember we're all humans, we all make mistakes. and probably more often than not, the person in front of you fear the exact same thing you fear.

it's painful, it's not easy, but social anxiety, ""regular"" anxiety, other type of anxiety can be solved. i felt like people should've known how to be more compassionate towards themselves. i'll not write a bible scroll here over how to deal with each and every one of those (just life experience and knowledge about the whole thing, not a professional) but the moment you're more compassionate towards whatever it is that's ahead of you and you've not done properly, life will get better.

and rather than self-loathing, you'll even get excited towards the next situation you've ahead of you. whatever the case is, in term of the anxiety, see it a a workout to your brain. that eventually you'll have the experience, knowledge, what to do and what to say at each circumstance, which eventually you'll be able to control your anxiety.

i really hope this help anybody. my heart just break seeing how people are suffering from all of this, and the biggest point for me wa how harshly judgemental we are towards ourselves. at least many post i see on this sub, socialanxiety one and others.",anxiety

2875,"i haven't left my house much the past few day aside from going to work and the shop both of which were actually difficult to do. i know it seems like nothing but to me going on a walk sometimes it seems like the scariest thing in the world and it really terrifies me having people that i don't know really such a neighbour looking at me and judging me.
 i've been told so many time and i know that other people's opinion don't matter however it still terrifies me to have the thought of people  watching looking and laughing at me (not in a nice way) even though in reality that may not be true. and simply ignoring them doe not help it only make it worse.  i basically have social anxiety which keep coming back every few month to haunt me. actually just the other week i seemed and felt completely normal, wa absolutely fine because i wa around friend and family and i didn't really care what people thought of me. but then it just crept backup. the same thought and feeling that feel inevitable. i think it mainly come from doing anything alone where others are watching me, but i could also be with others and still feel.the same.  i think that i disrupt it when this happens because it is such a horrible feeling and it make me just want to run away so that is why i try my best to ignore it. this anxiety is so debilitating that i can't even leave my house because the moment that i do leave i will just come running back in. it's so difficult to explain but i've had this for so long and i have done a lot of self work and learnt that anxiety is usually trying to tell you something maybe there are hidden possibility and opportunity underneath the anxiety but the feeling that i am experiencing recently ha nothing to do with that and i think this is a much deeper rooted issue, maybe to do with my self worth. it's kind of like i can mentally make myself feel ok but then when i go to do what i mentally feel okay to do (such a going for a walk around my area), my body is not aligned and i start freaking the heck out and run away. i don't know how to address this type of anxiety and panicky feeling. it's also mixed in with shame around others seeing who i really am i think.  i do not want it here anymore though. how can i live my life normally like i did before? i just don't really know what to do anymore. i'm so sorry if this made no sense it so hard to explain.

2898,"hello all.

i wa wondering if one of you went through a similar situation / experience to mine.

a couple month ago i started experiencing really bad insomnia. usually i used to sleep until 3-4am and wake up the next day at like 9am no problem. then one day i noticed i had more difficulty than usual going to sleep but didn't think anything of it. the 2 following day i had chance to sleep more but didn't bother because i thought i wa fine. this wa the worst mistake i could have made. the following day i could not sleep at night at all. i tried to make up for it the next day, which i did but i ended up waking up at 3pm throwing my whole schedule off. the following 3 day i barely slept at all and felt like a zombie. i developed sleep anxiety around day 5/6 and then i started taking melatonin.

i am incredibly sensitive to drugs. i started with 1.5mg of melatonin (i know, nothing) and then jumped to 3mg before i could start sleeping properly. i kept taking it but slowly lowering the dosage the week after out of fear that i would not be able to sleep if i stopped taking it. (i later realized after lowering the melatonin dosage my anxiety began to drop. mybe placebo, idk.) 

then all of a sidden one day i looked at the time and started getting worried about how i am going to preoccupy myself until bedtime and whether i would be able to sleep at all. thing that used to never bother me started bothering me like relationships, friends, etc... i started getting worried that my weekend were going to be boring, the following day were going to feel boring, and that every day until next year wa going to be boring. i can't watch certain show because after i am done with these, what then? during the pandemic i literally did the same thing over and over again for almost 2.5 year without any issue and incredibly happy while doing so.

fast forward now, and i still get anxious over what i am going to do for the weekend and what i will be doing for the next day. i sleep just fine at night. i have no idea where this ocd like behavior came from or how to make it stop. that one thought i had during my bout of insomnia ha made me anxious about literal time. i find myself constantly looking at the clock for some reason which i think is related to my old sleep anxiety but it ha created new problems.

(i wa born here my parent werent so the culture and upbringing wa kind of mixed for me) my parent have made so many sacrifice for me and have put up with so much of my issue and are very understanding. i dont have the worst life in the world or anything. i feel like i dont have the right to be this dysfunctional and that my problems/trauma is nothing compared to some thing ive seen or heard. i know people deal with way worse. i feel like a piece of shit that ha no motivation and weak minded compared to other people. i dont know if youd consider this to be traumatic but i did have my face stomped on and slammed by a football player and his girlfriend. he kept punching me and stomping on me a i wa fading in and out of consciousness because i wa drunk i just kept getting knocked out and waking back up. he broke my orbital floor, my teeth, etc. i didnt go to a hospital for week after it happened. his friend pulled up on me threatening to kill me. and he assaulted me again 1 month later when i wa heavily intoxicated. this wa all over me accusing him of stealing my friend weed. the second time wa because i dissed him when i saw him on campus again saying something he didnt like i forgot what it wa but i did provoke him like a fucking idiot i wa on 6 mg of xanax for the first time. keep in mind though i never hit him. all of this is prescribed btw (but obviously i wasnt taking my med a prescribed. i just wanted to numb my worries). i didnt touch him though besides pulling on his dread a im getting pounded on the ground. i failed university the first time i took 5 class mostly because of this and my shitty decision making. i used to do 3 class and get straight as. then i got to university and severe severe social anxiety; just wanting to fit in ended my university career right then and there the moment i stepped foot on campus. i wa funneling vodka instead of beer mixed with xans (prescribed to me by my doctor because of how anxious i get) at parties. i would take 140 mg of adderall even 200 sometimes when i wanted to feel more confident and sociable. (i have a tolerance for a reason out of my control read later) smoked 2.5 g joint with xanax with no tolerance and then i would drive my friend right after. i wa slurring like crazy and driving recklessly and just completely out of my mind. id go to class on 30 mg of percocet having never tried it before. all of this heavy drug use wa because id get thought in my head like everyone think im awkward, everyone think im ugly, why do they look like they are disgusted of me, do they think im funny?, i want close friend but i dont think people like me sober, doe no one love me, etc. even walking into classroom would make me feel like everyones looking at me and judging me and id have a mini panic attack like my heart racing, stuttering, and muscle tightness stuff like that. it like repetitive and intrusive and the thought are racing at 100000 mile an hour. ive been diagnosed with ptsd, borderline, bipolar, ocd, social anxiety, major depressive disorder, adhd, generalized anxiety, and panic disorder. im not self diagnosed, i wa diagnosed by hospitals, doctors, and psychologists. the anxiety destroyed my life. i feel like my life ended when i wa 6 and started taking stimulants. i know you guy must be thinking im crazy for taking ritalin at such a young age but my dad a psychiatrist so he thought it wa a good idea. i would throw up from the ritalin/conceerta when i wa a kid id get headache everyday, anxiety constipation, etc. i wa a happy hyper kid before i started taking adderall apparently. and now it like im a sociopath with extreme anxiety and depresssion. straight dirtbag who never learns from his mistakes. college wasnt the first time i started using drugs. when i wa 13 i wa diagnosed with social anxiety.",anxiety

2930,"i am a 26f. i am extremely nervous about a decision i made. i left home a couple month ago and became a rommate with my best friend in her rental. another unit became avaliable next to her and i decided to rent it.

i am wondering if i made the right decision. there are pro and cons. help me add to the pro list.

pros:
1) $500 a month 
     * wa able to keep my saving 
     * landlord waved deposit fee
     * letting me break up ""last"" month's rent
     * so only paid $500 today 
     * cheap rent so can save and pay off debt easy
2) safe area 
3) my cat can be here
4) my best friend life next door
5) half hour from a major city and potential job
6) kinda cute inside, tub for me to soak and relax
7) light and water are really cheap too like $100 and $25 
8) quiet to study for my social work license exam
9) month to month i can leave whenever

cons:
1) a trailar in a trailar park, feel like a failure a little somehow because it's not a fancy apartment. i have a college degree but took off pursuing social work for a year due to my mental health. getting back into the process

2) 40 minute from my current job that i am burnt out on

3) in the country, middle of nowhere afraid the isolation will make me go crazy because i feel like my life is passing me by extremely quickly and i will be old soon

4) water ha high level of arsenic so not safe to drink 

mainly worried i am gonna be wasting my youth here. but i work in a major city. i can find a coffee shop to frequent. i can join the gym. i don't have to come straight home after work. and i can be looking for a job/apartment in the college town 1 hour away and really meet someone maybe in 6 month to a year move. go back for my master's. find a job i really love that pay more than my current one.

i'm sick of it, so i went to a different csm, and asked her if that wa true. the nice csm said she didn't know what i wa talking about and assured me that we don't have a problem and that she would look into it.

here's the problem. i'm not a very confrontational person. i didn't know what to do about the other csm except complain about it to the older cashier (plus they love the gossip), so i've spent like 2 month trash-talking the mean csm (they agree with me too). the day that she said i had an attitude problem, i had told another cashier that i wa so angry that i ""wanted to throw hands"".

this is where the im-dumb-and-bad-at saying-no part of me come in. i accepted it because i wa kind of just going along with the moment when she said she wa happy to start training me with a coworker on wednesday, but i knew long term that this wasnt going to work out. then several other worker started to come in the room to chat and take a break. they also wanted to see who the new employee wa and the manager wa giving me all this paperwork that had to be done to make it official. my anxiety boiled up and i wa frozen for a moment and i awkwardly said im going to have to decline the job and the room wa very silent. she thanked me for my time and said shell make sure shell pay me for my time and i thanked her. i said if thing change then i would probably try to apply again. i shouldve kept my mouth shut and left quietly or at least spoke more professionally but i wa stressed.

2960," hi all!

i wonder if anyone ha had similar experience in this aspect, and if so, i'd like to hear you share your version and how you've worked through it?

basically i've been focusing heavily on the anxiety part of my presenting symptom in the past year, through therapy/medication/self-help, and i do feel like i've got a better handle on them (either that or i've somehow stumbled into new coping mechanisms). but what i've noticed is that i think my anxiety wa a big motivator for a lot of thing in my life, and now that it's toned down, a lot of it seems to instead be replaced by new problems. 

for example - my anxiety wa often a way for me to stay present in social setting (as i wa so anxious about presenting myself properly and staying vigilant about their reactions), and now that i've sort of removed some of the worry about how i get perceived, i get a lot more quickly bored by people and conversations, and more quickly irritated a well. this ha made me feel really disconnected and fake/feeling guilty, because i don't want to act on these sudden new emotion in social settings.

or with another example, my anxiety wa a way to get work thing done. the fear of being judged or perceived a certain way, or the fear of failing to deliver, seemed to be what made me get thing done. with that toned down, i struggle to finish thing more and more, and seem to be at a loss for what my motivation is.

has any one experienced something similar? it's really frustrating, a it genuinely feel like my anxiety wa sort of load bearing and like by trying to fix a facet of a problem, i've somehow created new ones.

i know this may sound like a very small problem for some, but to me, i cannot stop worrying about it. i do want a child (or even two) with my husband, and i just know that i will regret not having kid when i am elderly. my husband feel the same way - he feel that he will regret it if we do not have kids. we both want to enjoy raising our child, going to their games, seeing them grow up, etc.

this issue started a cpl year ago when i came across smut featuring underage character while searching up a certain kink i like. i wa unaware anything like this even existed. i'll admit i masturbated and had an orgasm to these story before since then. but i never looked at it like ""ooh kid "" but instead i wa focusing on the kink part of the story and imagining myself in the submissive role (which wa the minor character). 

i never thought of this a an issue until i started feeling uncom around kids. at the time i wa living with a single mom and her 2 teenage boys. one i wa really close with cause out personality meshed really well. but i wa worried i liked him because i had read those story (and no i have never hurt a child)

when i realized this wa potentially damaging to me, i stopped. and i don't think i've had these worry before about child before this happened. i've done plenty of research and idk if i'm a pedo or not. i've also researched pocd. but idk if i have that either. 

i don't fantasize about being with child and i don't try to. but when i'm masturbating or even when i'm not, i get intrusive thought and they're hard to deal with. they've gotten so bad lately which u causing me to make this post. intrusive thought are common for me. when i wa in high school, i had a dream about having sex with my father and that's something that ha never happened nor do i want it to happen.

and there's time when i have intrusive thought about putting myself in danger or people that upset me getting injured badly. but those don't seem to compare to the one that are about kids. i can forgive myself about thought about my family or ppl i dislike getting hurt, but not kids. my worry is that i have fucked my brain up and i am a pedo. i'm worried this is not pocd. because i never had this issue until i read those stories. i never really looked at it a anything bad until i started having thought and realized it wa probably an issue. i wasn't looking at the kid part of the sexual story but at the kink part of it. which i know now probably doesn't matter to anyone who read this. 

idk what to do or even who i am. it's also important to add that i'm diagnosed with anxiety and depression. also ocd run in my family and my dad ha it but i've never been officially diagnosed. it's gotten to the point where i don't even wanna touch myself or allow myself to become aroused because i'm worried about these intrusive thoughts.

i'm worried i've trained my brain to somehow have these thought from reading those sexual store and even tho i hate the thoughts, they aren't intrusive and they're all my fault and doing.

2982,"i'm currently a junior in college and i have been feeling some serious anxiety from burnout and stress. i've had tiny moment of anxiety my whole life but i didn't realize what it wa at the time. one day in high school, i started feeling very off. it felt like my whole body wa swaying, my hand were sweaty, i couldn't sit still, i wa pretty certain i wa going to have a heart attack. 

after that class i went home and felt better, the next day i started getting that exact same feeling in the exact same class. that's when it started to click for me what wa going on. it wa pretty quiet for a few week until one day after school, i drove to dunkin to get a coffee. it wa very busy and i had to wait a while. i started feeling off, i would sit, then stand, then sit, then stand. i wa getting very uncomfortable and started getting that swaying feeling. this time though, i started to feel numbness, i didn't know how to control my breathing. my face, hands, and foot went completely numb and i ran out of dunkin and got in my car and drove home with no feeling in my body for several minutes. i remember i wa drinking like a 3 day old coke cause thats the only thing i had in my car and my mouth wa so dry

since then i've only had 1 other major panic attack where my finger got so numb that they became ice cold and froze in place like i wa making a claw. i've had ton and ton of anxiety attack since then but everything ha been managed. i wa diagnosed with a generalized anxiety disorder in 2019. still i went to college and started going to therapy. 

my first semester just wasn't good. i wasn't in the right place of mind to be in college and that point. i couldn't focus, i wa unmotivated, i wa anxious. i wa actually accepted to this college before my anxiety to play soccer but i quit knowing it would be way too much. my first therapist while in college gave me a quick 5 minute exam then prescribed my adderall after i said i had trouble focusing. i wa so upset that he just wanted to medicate me and not talk. i never went back to that guy. i ended up dropping out of college. i stopped living there a few week earlier and tried commuting but i just stopped going. i would go sit in a parking lot for hour so i could convince my parent i wa going. 

i realized how messed up this wa a my parent were paying for my college so i finally told them and they just knew i needed help and a break. luckily for me, my mom also struggled with gad bad a a teen and young adult. when she started realizing what wa going on with me and saw how fast i wa falling, she took me to her first husband grave who passed away young have a heart condition. i didn't understand it at the time, but she told me that no matter how bad life gets, it's better to be here on earth. she knew that with anxiety come depression and intrusive thoughts. this wa a nice thing because at the time i did have uncontrollable thoughts. i kept thinking ""i'm going crazy"" ""i'm going to kill myself one day"". i never actively wanted to die, but my thought were telling me that. 

that winter i ended up enrolling in a local college. for the first few weeks, i couldn't sit in a classroom for the full time. i started talking to people, engaging more in my work, and i found some comfort. i wa doing really well and then covid came. for most people, this wa really bad, but for me, i thought being online and the lockdown wa so helpful. i wa getting college credit without having to leave my room and it wa pretty easy for me. i also started doing therapy again online. over covid is where i realized the major of my anxiety stem from being a hypochondriac. the symptom that come with having gad where making me think i had health issues. 

my therapist specialized in deep breathing and mindfulness and it worked so well for me. after covid, i decided i wanted to get back out there, so i transferred to a school where my two best friend go and i wa going to live with them. it wa a big jump being a little over an hour from home but having my hometown friend wa huge. i had my expected bump and anxious moment my first semester. i ended up failing one class, but i held on and finished strong. my second semester i finished with a 3.5 which wa huge for me. my last semester of high school, my anxiety caused me to have a 1.9. in college if i didn't drop out it wa usually around a 2.5. 

now here we are today. it's hard to explain how i'm feeling. maybe the word is ""stuck""? from the start of this semester, i never really felt like i settled in and got in a groove. sleep, eat, school, repeat. i got complacent and stopped challenging myself. i wa about to give a presentation about a month ago and i started to panic for no reason. now i have 2 big presentation this week and the more i think about them the more i panic. i wake up and just feel dread and no motivation to do anything school. i definitely have a classic case of burnout but the stress and lack of motivation ha caused my anxiety to come back. i can't focus in classes, i have no motivation to try on my work, i've been skipping classes. i have come such a long way and don't want to go backwards.

after having been obsessing over my heart rate and compulsively checking/watching it  using a fitbit and pulse oximeter in mid through late september, i started having bout of sinus tachycardia at random that would take hour to calm down. 

the first time it happened i went to the er a i wa frightened by the fact it wa without any cause or symptom like those of my panic attacks. 

these tachycardia kept happening at random (mainly when i wa upright) since and were only really relieved by laying down for a while. i already know that pot syndrome could explain the correlation, but when this first started happening it wa a hit or miss kind of thing. i started laying down a lot more all day a now being upright would leave me frustrated and fatigued from the various rate my heart races. 

but a i mentioned, at this time it wasnt every single time i got up, until early october it started happening every single time. ive had 6 ekgs, 1 echocardiogram, a week-long heart rate monitor and blood work done. preliminary finding ha only been sinus tachycardia. 

i have tried every single day to stand up and walk around for a bit while practicing apparently needed exposure therapy and cbt, which i perfectly know how to do a ive needed both for various ocd obsession in the past but nothing ha made a dent in stopping my heart from immediately racing a i get up, for a long a im up. 

i have tried a beta blocker but had chest pain and severe dizziness and my cardiologist advised not to use them a my heart rate drop into the low 40 already when sleeping. my resting heart rate/laying ha also increased from the 50 to the 70 and 80 from constant stress and lack of physical activity, only further fucking up my heart. 

i have been so debilitated and stressed from my life literally being taken away from me all because my mind want to make my heart race when i just want to fucking exist and be upright like everyone else.

ive lived my 20 year in severe anxiety,fear,stress,worry,this brought bullying,school failure,solitude that i spent most of my life in my room infront of a computer,all this resulted in constant pain emotional and physical.

not until last year where i decided not to do anything be it more school or work, i wa planning on taking this year to study home on my own or to develop a skill that might give me a chance to do something productive and make a living for once, the first obsticale that wa on my mind wa the inability to concentrate, something ive suffred from my whole life, wa it adhd wa it something else it doesnt matter. at this point im already aware of something called meditation and ive tried it once before but being an anxious person i wa looking for instant or at least quick results, so i only did it for a day or two, anyways after finding some reddit post about how meditation improved thier concentration i decided to give it another shot but to be consistent this time, after a couple of day not even a week i began to notice subtle diffrences in my emotional state and physical especially concerning my appetite which wa none existant for the entirity of my life, i would only eat enough so not to feel hungry so food wa just a nuisance really, but now to the surprise and delight of my mom im asking for seconds(not sure if thats the correct use of this expression), secondly and this is one of the big changes, i seemed to be le sensetive both physically to the cold for example and also against emotional damage, not a easily intimidated a i used to be, i mean i used to avoid argument and confrentations like the plague, my biggest fear wa getting yelled at, now im the one doing the yelling. at this point im only talking about the first few day where these thing were still subtle, but after continuing to meditate, these change got bigger and bigger.

now after living my whole life in my room which served a a prison and my anxiety a the bar i can go out no problem, when people used to scare the hell out of me now they are nothing to me, thats another thing, self-esteem, i never knew what that was, i always saw myself a lower, i dont care if you live in a sower i would still see you a above me.

apparently meditation shrink the amygdala which is an area in the brain responsible for regualating emotion like stress, this is most likey the culprit for for most of you, but anyways, here is a solution that requires no money spending, no outside intervention, i mean i fixed a problem that wa ruining my life without even leaving my room, dont tell me this isnt worth a shot.

btw, just a little thought, something that ha been spinning in my head lately wa how i remember that before i found this solution, there wa a moment where some relative were in the house chatting, laughing, having fun, while im alone a usual just in the room next to them, my heart wa in pain and i remember thinking if only the loneliness didnt hurt like this i would be okay with it, a month later i got exactly what i wanted. (thats something else that meditation gave.)

there are a lot of way on the internet a to how to meditate, if you want to be spared the search here is what i did:

i sit in the lotus position(i just cross my legs, no need for that wierd knee wrecking way of doin it), try a best you can to keep youre back straight but dont force it to the point of pain this is just to make sure youre breathing is of good quality, close youre eyes, inhale, count to 6s, exhale and stay there for 8s, then inhale again and repeat.

now a to what to do in your mind:

concentrate a best a you can on counting those second in your head, youre mind will wander it inevitable thats just what the brain does, your job is to bring yourself back to concentrating on the counting, so everytime you wander bring your self back, dont get frustrated if you wander for too long it still happens to me.

i started doing this 10mins every morning(i dont mean wake up early, whenever you wake up, and i dont mean straight after waking up, whenever.) and night before sleeping, but i think it doesnt matter when this is just what i did.

some still care, and a such, i'll stick around for now. but recently, i have come to the realisation that i'm no longer sticking around for me but for others. i'm just afraid that the relationship i have will decay, and that anxiety will prevent me from forging new. people say that i'm supposed to be in the best year of my life and that now i am going to be getting lifelong friends. but if thing keep going like they are, then they will not last. maybe i'll be forgotten at some point. maybe i'll go then. but until then, it's just keep on going without having those i care for worry",anxiety

3042,"i've had anxiety (ocd a well a social anxiety and ptsd related)  my whole life. during a particularly difficult period where i wa going through a huge life change and wasn't taking other medication (and it wa 2020), a new psychiatrist prescribed me daily benzos. i'd heard of the negative consequence and wa apprehensive of this doctor suggesting this of his own accord, but i wa so desperate for relief i accepted. saw positive result immediately. soon after that doctor left his practice and i eventually ended up going to a doctor that made me stop cold turkey, which gave me terrible, incapacitating withdrawal despite only having been taking them daily for a few months. i wa desperate for relief and wa able to convince them to prescribe me them one last time until i could find a doctor who would work with me on gradually stopping. yet other doctor were extremely unhelpful and often just ditched my appointments, so anytime i got them on the phone i focused only on being able to continue my current regimen to keep me stable. the practice would circle me through their entire staff, so i never had one consistent doctor. found another doctor who appeared to be helpful until she turned out to be money hungry and extremely difficult to work with, which diminished my trust in her entirely. i'm still seeing her a it is nearly impossible to find a doctor who will prescribe me both a benzo and an adhd med, even if i express a desire to quit. but she is seemingly not interested in helping me taper, despite her saying she would. (she's more focused on trying to be my therapist &lt;i already have one&gt; and convincing me to stop drinking socially). 

so i decided to try to taper myself, a i realized the klonopin wa not even really helping my anxiety anymore a by this point, over 2 year later, i've developed a tolerance to my low dose. i attempted to half my dose. i tried for 2 months. i didn't experience any physical withdrawal but my anxiety wa slightly worse, which led to my depression symptom skyrocketing. i had awful brain fog and couldnt get anything done and had frequent cry fits. i informed both my therapist and psychiatrist and they seemed proud of me for trying  but didn't offer any further help. i didn't ask for it. admittedly it wa a little bit self harm... i figured i didn't deserve to feel good, especially with the help of benzos. 

after 2 month of feeling hopeless, i finally decided to try to go back to my regular dose. my mental health improved significantly.  after witnessing me in an awful state my previous session and hearing how much better i wa doing a few week later, my therapist asked what changed and i told her i wa back on my normal dose. she seemed disappointed (as much a is professional for a therapist to be) and encouraged me to speak to my therapist about continuing the process, a 2 month may not have been long enough to get used to the taper. i decided to try alternating day of my original dose and my half dose.

i am so frustrated. i just took my half dose and the difference is immediately apparent. i feel jittery and just want to get back in bed because being productive feel hopeless. i don't want to be dependent on benzos but i don't want to lose month of my life going through withdrawal that make my life a shell of what it should be. thank you for reading my rant.",anxiety

3075,"the source is how to rewire your anxious brain, which i recommend to everyone.

* telling yourself to stop feeling anxious because of some reason doesn't work because this is a cortex (certain part of you brain) based method. but the cortex can't directly influence the amygdula so logic based approach fail a lot. the cortex can activate the amygdula with fearful thought but can't calm it down in the same way. 
* the stress response come from the amygdula (another part of your brain). relaxation methods, meditation or breathing excercises can help to calm it down. but it also take practice for these method to become more effective.
* sleep and excercise influence the amygdula a lot. so getting decent sleep and excercising healthily is helpfull.
* listening to music or even singing engages your right brain hemisphere in positive emotion and make you not think about the thing that bother you. therefore music can lift the mood effectively and reduce anxiety.",anxiety

i'm on buspirone and clonidine because all other med that i've attempted have amplified my disorder and made it so much worse. 

now here's what happened/is currently happening:

today i started getting upset for a few different reason and these reason are ""stupid"" to me, i just can't validate them for the life of me. then i started getting anxious, which promptly reminded me that i haven't taken my med and i can only take my clonidine because of how i have to space out my buspirone (every 12 hours) but my clonidine is a needed.

my husband ha already fallen asleep at this point, i'm playing with a fidget spinner to stop myself from going into a hot disaster of a breakdown, i start doing this weird thing where my brain is trying to convince me that nothing is real (not dissociation, i do dissociate and this isn't even close to that). it's almost like my mental dialogue is ""nothing's real, you're just playing with a doll in an asylum or dead or something."" ""no that's impossible i can see, touch/feel, smell, hear, etc."" 

i eventually got out of that mess before it got too bad, and my 14 month old fell asleep so i took her bottle out of her crib and went to the kitchen to put it in the sink. we have a mirror that i walked by and only saw it out of the corner of my eye. the reflection wa of me, i know it wa of me, i saw it.... but then the inner dialogue that i'm trying so hard not to have happened again just... creepier? ""your eye are lying to you, there wa what resembled a creature from a horror movie a your reflection, smiling and waving at you"" *queue getting a mental image of that description* ""no there wasn't, can't be, weird horror creature don't have (insert my face here)."" 

so i decided to just cacoon myself in my bed because my brain is trying to make me scared of nothing. then realized it might be an anxiety thing but wasn't sure so now i'm here, and writing this ha given me enough time for the clonidine to kick in plus just ha helped me feel better overall.

so what do you think? is this my anxiety acting up or could it be something else? this ha happened before but on a larger scale and i wasn't able to calm myself down for a few hours. my next psyche appointment is on the 22nd but i can always make it sooner if this is potentially a more serious situation.",anxiety
3086,"i need help i just woke up from having chest tremor and rapid palpitation i wa and i am so afraid!!! please tell me someone had the same symptom because of this damn anxiety :(

i already had an ekg done and it came back normal. please help :(",anxiety
3087,"i believe i have anxiety. i went to therapy about two year ago, and suffered the symptom which brought me to that clinic for about a year and a half. i rejected medication; i did not want to deal with them because the country that i live in criminally overprescribes. my psychologist hardly met me twice before pushing pills. having turned that down, and stopped attending those half-assed sessions, i tried to solve my way out of this myself. i joined the rowing team and quit smoking. i began to sleep better; the persistent low-grade fever dissipated; i wasn't becoming flushed in my face to the point that my friend asked if i were drunk; and i found myself smiling and socializing again. within a month, i felt like a wholly different person. but fast forward to three month ago, some symptom began to creep back in. before i knew it wa even happening i wa bedridden, fever coming back with incessant diarrhea, and i wa cancelling meeting with my friend left and right, avoiding them and now i have turned off my phone and email out of shame. i am so high-strung that i am chronically masturbating to ease the tension. this is no solution, i am aware. i know what the cause are- i have senior thesis to finish which i barely made much progress in and i am graduating soon. 

here is the problem then; i cannot decide on anything right now. i cannot decide whether to leave the house, whether to eat, whether to check my phone or take a shit. i stamp out my cigarette on a small patch of grass outside of my building, and come back to the spot after a minute just to check that the small ember ha not grown to burn down the entire tree above it. each time, every time. i leave the house and rush back in after taking few step away from the apartment block because i think maybe i forgot to turn off the hairdryer or something. again, every time. when my friend doe not return my calls, i think that i may have been cut off due to my flaky ass. given this paranoia, i cannot contend with the fucking potentiality of each and every decision that i make. i am either absolutely paralyzed with indecision or i flip a coin to let chance make the decision for me. i don't think it is working particularly well. 

my life is not objectively difficult, and my parent have made sure to provide for everything. it is just me - that i place such high expectation on my life. but gosh, even if i did want to fix that i would think it near-impossible. i also do not expect or require that my life be a happy one. i don't want to sound dour, but i believe that my expertise in living a myself allows me to at least tentatively conclude that some of u simply are not possessed with talent for happiness. long before any of this anxiety creeped in, i always had the sense that any time i wa not spending reading or studying wa time being wasted, and the guilt always held me back from meeting friends. but when i put that vision of life into action, i almost entirely lost my socializing skills, and felt quite lonely. this is a bit of digression, because those are issue i can deal with. and i will find some suitable lifestyle for myself. i just havn't found it yet. 

but i do wish to live without having watery shit, ridiculously flatulent, being fucking tired for no reason, and wanting to sleep all the time or not wanting to sleep all the time. a soon a possible, too. during the absolute depth of my anxiety few year back, i thought that i had cancer, due to my lethargy, fever and absolutely ridiculous bowel movements. alas, i did not. so i am now apprehensive to see my abhorrent diarrhea return. if this fever and all that shit come back in full force during one of the most critical period of my life, i fear i may go into an irreversible negative spiral. 

i wish not to offend anyone by my rejection of medication. i don't wish to imply that i am above those who take pills. but to be honest i have never taken the anxiety seriously and have not committed to serious attempt at alleviating the symptoms. now this will all have to change. i am committed to working out at least a bit every day, even though looking at my own body in it currently emaciated state make me want to claw my eye out. i realized that drinking alcohol make my anxiety shoot through the roof the next day, so i will try to not drink at all (i've also never enjoyed drinking- but everyone else does). smoking doesn't help much either, but this i cannot quit right now unfortunately. i have never in recent year told anybody about what i am going through, and i made a breakthrough in telling my parent about some of it last week. i also recently got in a relationship with a girl who i hope to finally properly express myself to (i've had no long-term relationship for a while because i felt that i couldn't commit or that i just caused pain to others who found me emotionally aloof). so i am trying to get better, and i want you all to know it. 

but what i would like help with is that i currently simply cannot decide on anything at all. do i go to law school? do i apply to grad school? do i take my artistic interest seriously and explore those (these, to me feel absolutely delusional, but god damn how do i kick out those thoughts?)? i must make these decisions. but i cannot at the moment. not even the small ones. i cannot refuse anybody of any help they wish from me. any obligation i cannot meet i am too cowardly to refuse properly, so i just disappear. i don't know when to meet my girlfriend, so i always defer to her. i don't know when to eat lunch. i don't even know if i should. i am not asking for career advice here. i just really want to know what mechanism that every gut-trusting, intuitive, self-motivated, independent, and persisting people out there have that i don't. how do they know what to do? and what can i do to get to that place? if you cannot give me a tailored advice, please still do let me know what any of you did to get better. apology for lengthy post. any recommendation is welcome. i will try them all. much love.

one more thing, 

i know that reddit generally frown upon religion, but i hold little grudge against them if when a a set of private value for the individual. if anybody wa helped through religion or some form of spiritual practice, i would just like to hear their experience. personally i found reading st.augustine, dostoevsky, and nei ye somewhat helpful. bible too, helps. did it help any of you?",anxiety
3088,"well, just finished texting with pretty much the only person i talk to anymore, who i would probably call an acquaintance, and we basically just had a big conversation mourning the fact that we've both lost all of our friend over high school, and they they've all drifted apart from us

it kind of made me sad for them, because i've always just assumed that they had a nice life, they seemed to have good friends, and just a pretty nice and well figured out life, and to hear that they really aren't doing much better than i am wa hard to hear

but on the other hand, it wa also very reliving to hear that i'm not unique in my suffering, family, people here, and my therapist have all told me that it isn't unusual, but they all just felt too disconnected to trust, but now that i know someone who is actually living in the same world a me is experiencing the same problem kind of make it a little easier

but yeah, i don't really know what to do now, we both just talked for hour about how hard it is to make friend a introverts, and how we've drifted away from people we've cared about and stuff, so i'm not really sure where to go from here",anxiety
3089,"so, first off i am on the bc patch my long distance bf came on early november, i had sex with him with withdrawal method (heat of moment) i wa on my period at the time. it been about 3 ish week and im supposed to get my period this week but have been having weird symptom now im not sure if im just stressing out and my body is creating these symptom or i am actually in a very scary situation.

i have gone to see three different ophthalmologists. all have looked at my retina. all claim that they find nothing wrong. i have even had an mri done and gone to see a neurologist. but still no indication of anything being wrong.

anyway, i just wanted to post here because lately i feel very hopeless and that im losing my vision in my left eye. there seems to be no solution and the idea of ending my life keep crossing my mind. i feel like i have an incurable eye problem, and i feel very alone in it. no one else ha vision problem and i feel very isolated in this.",anxiety

anyways on to the problem at hand.  the other night a we were closing one of therapist introduced himself when we both realized we didnt know each others names. when he introduced himself he held out his hand for me to shake.  i shook his hand but he kept holding it and maintained steady eye contact while asking me follow up question about myself. i felt a t what i can only describe a a spark and butterfly while we talked. (turns out  have a lot un common) eventually he let go of my hand but ended up stayed 30 min past closing and chatted. 

heres where my dilemma come in. a u said everyone ha been super nice and friendly and i have ha many time in the pst of thinking guy are into me when really they are just being nice. how can i tell if he is  into me and how do i proceed at work. my social anxiety can make me act like a weirdo when i think someone is into me or even want to be friends.",anxiety

3140,"i've been preparing to take the exam i took today for a long time. the last 2-3 year though my anxiety ha gotten really bad to the point of having panic attack for no real reason. for example, i will start thinking about having a panic attack in a social situation, then i start to fear that thought i just had about having said panic attack. my mind spiral out of control until i am actually having a panic attack i totally induced myself for no fucking reason at all. 

but not today. this weekend i flew, fucking flew, by myself multiple state over to take a 3 hour fucking test in another goddamn motherfucking language. all week ha been a goddamn nightmare in term of anxiety. at work i wa doing nothing but thinking about this test. at home i did nothing but think about this test. in my bed, i did nothing but think about this test and occasionally have panic attack simply thinking about the fucking thing. 

but i didn't give up. here's what i did:

1) dropped alcohol for a week. i have not had a beer since last saturday because i know it affect my anxiety in bad way and i would need to be sober to have a clear mind and body today. in parallel with that i also dropped caffeine entirely three day before the exam.

2) meditation, meditation, meditation. holy fuck did i mention meditation? the amount of time i could not focus this week wa insane. meditation is probably the sole reason i could calm my as down today when my panicking started to go out of control a i entered the classroom. my heart rate skyrocketed and my body started to shake a i walked. deep breathing exercise helped me to calm down though.

3) in preparation for the exam i took three practice tests. i passed the third one. but it wa in the comfort of my own home so i knew the condition to set off my anxiety weren't there. but still, knowing that it wa le about the content of the exam at this point helped a lot. 

4) good night's rest. i made sure that every fucking day this week i got at least 8 hours. despite my 6 am flight yesterday morning i got my as in bed the night before at 7 and wa up at 3. last night, same thing, but i wa in bed at 7 and slept a long a i fucking wanted. woke up well rested at 7 this morning.

5) a good breakfast. this one i don't know i can say i followed to the letter. i wa originally going to eat at the hotel's restaurant, but seeing the waiter dressed in fancy clothes i noped the fuck out of there at the thought of buyer's remorse and probably not fitting in at my pay grade. i settled for a sandwich, a couple protein bars, and an oj from a 7-eleven near the test site instead.

8) got to the test site early. like... 4 hour early. luckily it took place at a university so i could walk around. the sun wa also out despite it being a rainy weekend which really helped my mood. i walked around for probably over an hour before finding a chair outside in the sun to sit at. 

so yeah, that's what i did. i honestly have not been this stressed out for a test since final exam in college and back then i didn't have performance anxiety to this degree. i told myself that the fact i feel this way mean i'm getting out of my comfort zone and not being complacent. i took it a a test of endurance and learning how to deal with this anxiety. 

there were moment where i legit though 'you know, i could just like, not take this test.' but i know that would've made me feel worse than attempting it even if i ended up having a panic attack in the end. 

i did not let my fear control me. and i think i'm slightly stronger because of it.",anxiety

i parked and instinctively whipped my head around to see what wa going on and because i wa tensed up from being startled that led to me having the worst back spasm of my life so i wa hunched over. i explained my situation but i also have a cold so my voice is shot. i kept coughing and couldn't sit straight for a long while. the cop asked me a lot of question about what substance i'm on and asked me if i wa \*absolutely sure\* my only issue were depression and anxiety. i told her about my autism a well and she said she figured there wa something going on. then she went back to her car and wa there for 20 minutes. i wa terrified i wa gonna be arrested and thrown in a mental hospital.

i would like to say that im not diagnosed with ocd or anything like paranoia, etc. i dont worry that something horrible will happen to me or my family if i dont count. the issue isnt constant either. i just want to do it when im bored and idling. which ha been problematic for intentional downtime, silently walking outside, for example.

sometimes, when i feel particularly anxious i feel such a strong want to do it. ive deterred myself from doing it repetitively when i feel bad by snapping myself slightly on the wrist with a rubber band four times.

i had an issue similar to this before, where i would rhyme word in my head when i wa idling, and it became so annoying. 

i suppose my question is, how normal is this? will it just sort of pas like my rhyming habit? should i mention it to my psychiatrist? it didnt happen in conjunction with a medication change. and, i suppose i worry ill be misdiagnosed with something like ocd, because i certainly dont exhibit other symptom of ocd.

i don't know how i've made it through almost 30 year in my life without knowing this, and maybe it's common knowledge that i just somehow missed, but i recently learned that the weeks-long period of not being able to catch my breath are caused by high stress and anxiety worsening the effect of mild asthma.




growing up, i always saw depiction of asthma a the kid who couldn't play sport without an inhaler or kid with a lot of allergy problems. i played some sport in high school and never had allergy so i never thought that applied to me. though i've always had period of difficulty breathing, i always chalked it up to being a panic attack prolonged by my obsessive anxious thought for day or even weeks. in other words, i thought it wa all in my head.





i recently went to the doctor after a week of an awful respiratory bug because i wa having trouble breathing for 2 day in a row so i thought it could be covid. well, not only did i test negative for covid, but my doctor asked if i'd ever used an inhaler before and explained that sometimes asthma is so mild that you might not notice it much in day to day life but that it can be triggered by stress a well a sickness! 





i wa prescribed steroid to help with the inflammation that the bug caused to my apparently already-constricted asthmatic airway and low and behold i can breath again! i used to think that the trick to being able to breath again wa to find a way to distract my anxious thought but now every breath i take, i'm actively thinking ""is this going to be a struggle?"" but it work every time because it wa apparently not all in my head.

i wanted to share this success with you. i just got a job a an office clerk. here is my story:

i used to be a teacher for four years. last year i had a huge panic attack in the classroom and went to the hospital to be referred to a psychiatrist. i had to go on a sick leave because of my anxiety. i think i wa dealing with postpartum anxiety and depression, since i had my baby two year ago. 

i wa on sick leave for 6 months. i started to feel better in april this year, so i decided i would get myself a job over the summer. it wa a low stress job and i did pretty well at it. a the summer got on i got excited about starting teaching again in the fall. 

when i got back to teaching i had a panic attack on the first day back. i got through it and decided to keep on trucking. i had several anxiety issue all throughout the semester until one day i decided, i am going to quit! so i did. i quit because standing in front of my student talking and managing the class wa stressing me out so much. i think i also have social anxiety.

my admins were super supportive and understood my reasoning of quitting. but all of the teacher were sad about my news about quitting. that is when i had second thoughts, am i doing the right thing? what if i made a major mistake? what if this wa my forever career?

you know what? fuck it! it wasn't working for me so i am changing it up! i am not a tree, i am a person and i am allowed to change. i started applying for all type of jobs, but mainly simple office job where i could be productive but not be so on the spot in front of people. i am proud of myself for making this decision a it it the best thing for my mental health right now. 

whatever you are going through, you will get through it! this will pass, it really is true. dont forget that you have the power over your own life. it is super hard to do changes, but so worth it!

a couple month ago i started seeing a therapist who screened me for gad. i scored a 10, which the tool said meant a probable diagnosis of gad with further evaluation. i wa partly surprised by this because i am able to go to work, exercise, and have productive day without shaking, panic attacks, or other traditional symptom of gad. but i wa also unsurprised because covid ha been stressful for me. i am worried about catching covid knowing that it can cause long term health issues. it did not help me when the government decided to abandon all protective effort earlier this year like masking and testing. 

i showed the gad result to my doctor who kinda brushed it off and recommended another medication for sleep, hydroxyzine, which ha helped me fall asleep faster but ha not helped my primary issue of waking up too early. a year ago when i came to her with my sleep issues, she recommended doing the usual activity of keeping the room dark, limiting screen time, etc. i think i do all of them pretty well, i even have blackout curtain in my room. 

so, i am wondering if i should go back to my doctor and ask her to take another look at anxiety, and if a medication for that should be considered. ha anyone had luck with sleeping better after taking anxiety medication? i'm kinda at a loss of what to do a i feel like i have done every lifestyle change possible to improve my sleep. i should also add that i started meditation a month ago with the waking up app, which i enjoy, but that ha helped my general mental health and not my sleep issues.",anxiety

so about 4 year ago, i got dumped while i wa very much in love. i had professed my love about 8 month before i got dumped. i felt like my lover at the time wa building towards a big exciting message, but instead i got dumped on the night we were going to a concert we had been looking forward to for months. he broke me.

2 year later, i had enough of being alone. i got on tinder, matched with an attractive man (let's call him b), chatted for 2 week before going on a date. everything wa going great for a couple of dates. but then i started having feeling for b. and that's when my anxiety took me over. i couldn't communicate my feelings, what if he think i'm insane or going too fast or something? i let my feeling build and build a bit more. until i broke.

we kept in touch but stopped dating. i went through therapy, which had helped me a lot. contact got more intense once more, anxiety came back but le intense. eventually i got feel again, and had the courage to ask about 'us'. we were just friends, right? oh. oh well. sadness.

summer came this year, i went and did my own thing all summer. i felt great without him. maybe i should just be alone for a while, see what that's like. no intention to hook up or date anyone, see what the world is like for lonely old me. i have not had any anxiety issue for the whole summer and autumn.

in march of this year i had placed a bet with b, i would give him a beer for 3 separate things: no lockdown in autumn, no mask requirement, no test requirement. we hadn't talked for about a month. i got a reminder on my phone that the end date wa coming up for this bet. i scrolled way down in my whatsapp message and saw his profile picture. with a woman by his side, big smile all around. my heart sank (not that i thought i still had a chance, but still... always a shock when a previous love interest ha found someone.). i sent him congrats on the gf and reminded him that we had a bet and he wa owed 3 beers. i got invited for new year eve to make the exchange.

now my mind is racing. i don't want to be alone, even though the party will be with plenty of people. everyone know each other there, except me. i only know the guy i dated. i don't know anyone else. i'll probably be awkward af... i'm not sure i want to go. my body is filled with butterfly trying to claw their way out of my chest. he's been insisting i come to his new year's party, 'it'd help your anxiety to know more people, right? i promise everyone is nice!' sure. everyone is nice. but not everyone like me for who i am. not everyone like to engage the awkward corner-hugging weirdo.

just typing this out ha calmed the flesh-eating butterfly down a bit. they're still there, but not a intensely.

i should work on myself a bit more. i should go back to therapy. but it's not bad enough. maybe i should try another session of shroom therapy, which ha helped me figure out that the root of my anxiety isn't in my youth. i'm pretty sure it's rooted in my experience with my ex from 4 year ago. it felt so good to reminisce all the memory i thought i had lost. i am sure that this time around my feeling during the trip will be way more intense. i might be terrified, i will feel the love once more, i will get angry, frustrated, all the feel will come back. a part of me doesn't want to feel these feelings, but i have to let them go. i will need a trip sitter. it will cost me plenty of money. but it will be worth it.

i've tried to be verry open, calm and nice to them from day 1. i'm showing intention that i'm willing to learn and grow the way it work there because i really enjoy the work itself. i try to ask relevant question out of interesst and take note whenever anyone tell me tip and tricks. yet i just sense alot of time that they're doing their thing like i'm not even there.  at the end of the day when the next couple people show up for the next shift, the co-worker of the current shift which i wa involved talk about the day to eachother and pas on the information of what happened etc.. to the next group of people without involving me. it's like i get completely ignored at that point and it feel like a nasty sting.
to the point it give me this scared and insecure feeling which lead me constantely thinking it's all slipping out of my hands. every time i sleep now i'm dreaming of work and i feel everything but rested.

i'm not sure how to deal with all this because i know i'm good at what i did for the past 8 years. it feel bad because when i had new worker at my old place i always tried my best to let them fit in and make them comfortable. now i ended up in a place where i feel i don't fit in and i'm being uncomfortable.
i don't want to screw this up because the work is just so much fun..

hello!

ive been struggling with severe anxiety/health anxiety for the last few year and it appears to come into a full collapse whenever im in public and im here looking for advice for anxiety stomach issues. 

im usually fine when im home alone and can distract my mind enough to get through a day when nothing is on my schedule.

however, whenever i do anything in public, such a going to a concert or the movie with my girlfriend, i feel nauseous and feel the need to constantly visit the bathroom out of worry.

i began therapy a few month and take .5mg of xanax a needed, usually in preparation for a public setting. but a we know, anxiety is a lengthy process of trying to find healing mechanisms.

my issue now is im currently traveling for work and am having a hard time eating due to how often im around others/in non-home settings. the xanax is obviously there when i need it, but im not solely relying it out of fear of it addicting capabilities. 

if any of you have advice for food/ideas to calm my anxiety stomach down, id greatly appreciate it. i have a little le than a week left for this work trip fyi. thank you all!",anxiety

3243,"i moved to a new apartment recently cause i needed space. my old house is filled with cats, so my parent live there now. but few day ago my dad surprised me with a puppy. and i hated it. 

he is very naughty. he kept chewing on everything including my toes. i even made a vent post about it. but i ended up deciding to just keep it.

i wa overwhelmed at first but i started to warm up to him and i think we get along better now. he mostly behaves a long a i have treats. but he's very clingy. he howl and whine whenever i leave him for too long and reverts back to his old habit of eating shoe and furnitures. so i spend most of my time with him. it's kinda ok, since i just work from home anyways. and unlike our cats, he can't reach me up while i'm busy doing work or cooking. so aside from morning walks, we both never left the house.

yesterday, my dad came to visit me again. and to my surprise he began preaching me of everything i'm doing wrong with my pup. he said i should feed him a lot more, a few kibble are not enough. i should replace his water with milk. he saw the bite mark on my couch and told me if it were him, he would discipline the puppy to be more behaved. yada yada yada. he made it sound like he's the dog expert.

so i dared him to babysit my puppy for a day. he wa taken aback for a bit but i guess he had no choice but to take it.

so finally i had a day off. i hit the gym. after the move, and the puppy, i missed a lot of day to workout. then i restock on groceries. then i went to a vet clinic and inquire about what should i do with my puppy and scheduled an appointment the next day for his first checkup and shots. i bought a carrier and some toys. 

it wasn't that long, maybe just 6hrs top. the sun hasn't even set yet when i got home. but i wa in for a surprise of how much destruction a tiny little puppy could bring.

first, the paint on my wall had been peeled off. i don't know how he managed to scrape them off. then the back of my couch is gone, it's torn to shreds. then one of my chair is missing a leg. 

there were piss and poop and puke everywhere. i deal with some piss and poop every now and then and i'm used to it for a while now since he's not yet potty trained. but my puppy never puked before. but i guess all those paint chip and piece of furniture ha to come out somewhere.

and a colony of ant had moved in. my dad filled the feeding bowl to the brim with kibble soaked in milk like cereals. it seems my puppy never attempted to even taste that abomination so now only the ant feast on it.

also i live somewhere with tropical climate. so imagine how foul the odor of spoiled milk, mixed with all the dog excrement filling up the room- it's suffocating. yet i found my dad sleeping in my room, blissfully unaware of his surrounding. 

so i woke him up and asked him what happened and he began blaming it on me. cause it took me forever to return. that he got so bored waiting and fell asleep. yada, yada, yada. 

i got no time to argue. so i just lured the pup with the new toys, and locked it up in my room while it's distracted. then i grabbed the mop and began cleaning up the excrements. i asked my dad to deal with the spoiled milk and the ants. 

i can hear my dad still explaining and defending himself. but at this point i just imagined there were laugh
tracks playing in the background and we're in some kind of sitcom. at least that way i could contain my rage.

after quickly wiping the floor, i went to the kitchen to get more cleaning supply and found my dad just standing there. apparently he just put the bowl on the sink. he didn't even bothered soaking it in water or even emptied it content. so now the ant were crawling everywhere.

he just continued to blame me for not disciplining my puppy. wth, it's not even a week since i got him!

i've had enough. so i just admitted to him that yes, it's my fault. and thanked him for babysitting and politely asked him to leave. but he didn't listen, and just kept on explaining himself. i had to push him out of the door just for him to get out of the way. bid him farewell and return to the battlefield.

i spent the night just cleaning up. it took a while to deal with the smell too. it's annoying a hell. this is what i get for depending on my dad. i never learn.

after cleaning i let my puppy out. good thing it wa so dumb it wa oblivious to all the drama. he's just so happy with his new chew toy that he already torn apart by now. i wa too exhausted, i fell asleep immediately.

today when i woke up, i smell like shit. i forgot to check my room, and didn't notice my puppy left me a little present under the blanket. also, the ant are back, and now they're in my room too. but i have no time to deal with them now. so i just took the sheet away and put them in a garbage bag for now. 

i washed up, and brought my pup to the vet. while waiting i had time to reconsider my decision of keeping the puppy. it had already disrupted my routine and he's bringing me so much anxiety. not just that, it's so expensive a fuck too. when i got the bill from the clerk, it make me regret ever keeping it.

i called my mom and asked her opinion about it, maybe even consider taking the puppy back to my parent so dad could take care of it himself. and then there i found out mom doesn't even want it too.

turns out, they even had a fight about it. the puppy wa from one of the neighbor that according to my mom she caught my dad trying to flirt with. so she got jealous when dad brought home a puppy that came from that whore (her words). 

she said she's just about same age a me and she walk her dog in the park everyday in her skimpiest outfit and my mom saw my dad trying to strike a conversation with her whenever they go out. mom said the only reason dad took the puppy wa so he would have an excuse to meet up with her to walk their dog together. 

we have a dog too, a little shih tzu, but she doesn't want to ever leave the house. she's very couragous and protective. no one can touch her except my mom and sometimes me if she's in the mood. she doesn't bark, she just immediately bite anyone who try to pet or anyone who seemed like a threat to her or my mom. and my dad can never even get close to her.

so i guess that's why my dad can't bring our dog to the park. so he found another way by taking one of the neighbor's puppy instead. anyway, mom's got really angry at my dad and told him to return the puppy. she didn't even know my dad brought it to me instead. and now she want me to get rid of this puppy.

what now?

i'm looking at my puppy, and he's giving me puppy eyes. i don't know if he can sense that i'm having doubt about keeping him or he's just too scared after getting shot and having a cone around his neck and want me to just stay with him so he's giving me the looks. but it's effective and i feel very sorry for him. and also i don't even know how to return him.

i have social anxiety, i can't usually function when dealing with social situation and i guess returning a puppy to a random woman my dad's trying to flirt with is one of those situation where i probably would malfunction completely. i might get panic attack and unable to speak a word if i meet with her.

so i imagine just putting it in a box and leaving it on her doorstep and ring the bell. maybe add a note explaining that my dad can't take care of it. but of course i can't do that. maybe i'll just talk to my dad later and plan our action. make him take responsibility for once.

2 year ago we lost our family dog due to malpractice. encourage my folk to take bella to the vet. they went to a random vet dropped her off for blood work and x-ray to check why she wa panting constantly and we picked her up dead. i took the blame and guilt consumed me. since then i developed a phobia about leaving my own fur baby alone to the vet. i no longer trust vet let alone vet tech. so i only go to vet clinic who will accept drawing blood in-front of me. i even prep for them and shaved the site so they can easily see her vein. i do a yearly exam and blood work for her. she's a chihuahua terrier mix, 9 yr old going 10 in couple months. few day while brushing her teeth i notice a black color half pea size bump close to her lip. i panicked almost passed out of worry. it wasn't there the other night cause i brush her teeth nightly. sometimes 2x a day. took her to the same vet last year and she didn't really give me any other option except surgery to biopsy. i asked for a fine needle aspiration she said since it's located close to the lip she doesn't think it's best. she wa pushing for surgery asap and telling me scary story about her other patient that ended up having cancer. i asked if i can monitor for now see if it doesn't grow and make any changes. she then told another story about another patient whose lump never grew cause of low grade risk but ended up being malignant. like she keep making me worry. money isn't an issue a i told her my concern she's older and i have worry leaving her out of my sight cause of what happen to our fam dog. i am going thru my own health issue and this is scaring me to death about her. if i go ahead with surgery and something bad happen to her or vet just try to grab $ from me and do unnecessary thing that will put her thru pain, i'd never forgive myself. if i leave it alone and just do 6mos to 1yr vet check up blood work and continue to give her the best care a long she's not in pain or showing symptom and suddenly she passed in her sleep at least she wa with people who love her and she didn't have to be alone and go thru all that hardship of surgery and risk dying due to malpractice. i wish the vet will allow me to be present in the surgery but i know that's silly. i don't know what to do. i keep thinking what did i do wrong? her meal is home cooked all organic. i buy her the best quality bed, shampoo, toys, stroller, massage her, and our home is cater to her needs. why did she ended up having this stupid black mole! i am begging to god it's not cancer nor will it grow, change shape or give her pain. husband and i don't have kid so we treat her a one. what should i do?",anxiety

why do i overthink so badly and just assume the worst in everyone a soon a i get a little anxious about the situation. like i'm talking to this woman (long distance) and i've done everything to secure them and we have even put label on each other and i'm pretty sure that she is loyal and not up to anything spooky but for some reason every time she go out or take a little long to respond my whole stomach turn and i can't shake all of the negative thought about what she might be doing because i can't be there to know and confirm she is not doing anything.... like i know this is an issue with me but i just don't know how to deal with it.... whenever she mention going out with her guy friend i just get filled with all this doubt and i have no reason to...... she mentioned that one of her guy friend didn't like me and for some reason that really hit me because i try so hard to get along with everyone in her life because i want to be in it for a while....... but she spends so much time with her male friend that i just am always anxious but whenever i ask her if she is mine and no one else's she say yes so i get all confused at myself about why i think like this....... like she ha told me that she only want me but i can't help doubting it.... especially when i'm so far away....... it's hurting me but i don't want to let her go.... 

&amp;#x200b;

i also have a huge fear of meeting her in person and disappointing her, like i've made it clear and we both know what each other look like but i'm just so nervous to see her in person because i don't know if she'll still want me. we talk about all these big plan and i'm committed to doing it for her but what if it doesn't work out........ i just can stop thinking negatively about everything around this whole situation...i really needed to get this off my chest.... 

&amp;#x200b;

more than anything i don't want to hurt her in the process of this stupid thinking...... i'm not sure how i can get through this without hurting her or making her think i'm crazy.......i'm head over heals for this girl and it would destroy me knowing i lost her because i'm overthinking..... it would ruin me but i don't know how to deal with this feeling....

3275,"this really ha been the leading part of my anxiety-misery the last 3 years. i constantly feel tense. i have barely taken a normal, deep breath in 3 years. having a conversation is nearly impossible because the tension cause me to have little to say. it kill all my creativity. it kill all my happy emotions. it kill my ability to be in and enjoy the present moment. it cause a near continual dissociation. it make sex nearly impossible because i can hardly get and keep my dick hard. feeling tense is hell.

i've recently used bilateral stimulation to lessen my emotional response. lessen the continuous sympathetic stimulation i wa feeling. i had a week where i could sit in silence again. did not need constant distraction from the immense discomfort i wa feeling physically. then me fearing my bilaterial stimulation work would become compulsive (it sort of became my go to stress coping mechanism) and i would constantly feel an urge to do those movement brought the tension back.

i am so afraid of being tense, that i feel tense. considering the pure hell it gave me over the last 3 years, no wonder. i don't know how to deel with this fear except to continue healthy bilaterial stimulation/emdr excersises whilst processing my feelings. talking about it and clearing my thought is the other.

feeling tense is hell and i'm scared of it. more than almost anything. i fear few thing more. it ha made me feel so immensely shitty for so long and i really hope the work i do will eventually bring me more life happiness. where i feel comfortable to start a relationship again or what not. all i want is to be able to relax and be calm again. i miss that feeling. i'm tired of being this way, but i will keep going. i am noticing a slow upward trend, so cheer to that development.",anxiety

so i'm in my late 20's, and had been a delivery driver for a local independent restaurant for the past two years. i've been a loyal employee and always friendly and customer-oriented.

it's a laid back place, and the manager is a younger girl in her mid 20's.

like all drivers, i'm just part-time. it's been the toughest year of my life, so sometimes i would ask for a few le day temporarily. even then, i worked full-time hour for a good five week or so, during a very difficult time in my life earlier this year.

anyways, in july i had told my manager that i'd be needing one week off in august, for a family trip.

when i got back, they hired a few new people and i wa being scheduled terrible hours! i politely asked my manager for better hours.

nothing changed.

i've texted the manager, and discussed it in person, to no avail.

now, last week, i asked to be on-call for a saturday morning shift, a day i've been asking to not work for weeks, since it's literally the slowest shift of the week... the previous week, i wa on-call and they never asked me to come in, so i figured the same would happen this week..

i slept in for an hour, and had text asking me to come in, that there's some deliveries.. it wa taken care of, but my manager wa pissed... it wa a first time issue, and this wouldn't happen if she changed the schedule... again, i've told her for week that i don't want these hour on saturday morning.

anyways, last night i wa working and usually soon before close, people can leave early... i noticed one driver already left, and asked the manager if i could... she said ""sure, if you sweep then you can go.""... so i begin sweeping..

then, some customer came in and she wanted me to stay until close... i told her i had a lot going on and would appreciate leaving early... she then said, ""fine, just go"" in an irritated manner, so i quickly clocked out and left.. it wa an urgent family situation,

today, i walk into work for my scheduled shift, and she told me i'm fired... it had gotten a bit busy after i left, and because of that she fired me. i pleaded with her, in tear which wa embarrassing, and she wouldn't budge. she told me that she ""didn't mean it"" when she said, ""fine, just go"" and that ""you should've known i didn't mean it""

i went home, and later began getting angry, because she told me to leave. this is on her, not me. she gave me the approval to leave, so i left. not my fault. if she would've asked me to stay, i would have.

i then spoke with the owner, and u and this manager had a conference call, and he defended her. i explained clearly how she said i could leave, so i did and that i shouldn't be fired. he said that i wa ""pressuring"" her to let me leave early, when i didn't at all. the call ended with him confirming that i'm still terminated.

fast forward to more recently, i've been constantly overthinking my health, to the point where i always think i'm going to die soon. i get so caught up in these motion that my face start to go numb, and i get this needle feeling in my face and all over. 

it get so much worse at night while i lay down. it feel like my chest is tight, arm hurt, like i've pulled something that just won't fix.

3298,"i (20m) have felt for many year that i will never get to find someone to spend the rest of my life with. i struggle to talk to people, a soon a someone talk to me my mind go blank. i don't know what to respond with, so i just let out a light laugh and smile, almost every time.

i can only really talk to people after knowing them for a long time. like my coworkers, i've had my current job for almost two month now and can only barely talk to a few people without completely getting lost in my head. naturally, that make romantic endeavor impossible.

i don't have a proper social life, i can't, not when i can hardly talk to people. how could i possibly find someone if i can't talk? well, i can't, so i feel terribly isolated. i wish i could just talk to people without feeling so much pressure in my head. invaded by so many thought that flood out the ability to form a proper response. it's frustrating, and i will spend hour after a simple interaction wishing i could have said this or that instead of just smiling.

i have a strong dislike of being touched regardless of it being from a friend or family member. yet, i long to just hug someone who could reciprocate my feelings. 

no matter how pleasant a thought it is, i can't just expect someone to come along and save me from this painful experience. the world just doesn't work that way, it ha to be me to make the action to get what i desire. but how can i even do that when i feel so trapped in my head?

it's all on me, it's no one else's fault. it's me who can't talk to people, not everyone around me. i'm the reason i'm alone, and it feel hopeless. i wish i could have rectified this issue during childhood. now i'm an adult and i have no one to help me. i have to do everything on my own. i don't have anyone i can open up to.

was i brought into this world just to suffer in isolation and then pas away? that sucks. couldn't i have been at least given a brain that let me communicate? i've tried so hard and each time it's resulted in a resounding nothingness. i simply can't say the thing i desperately want to tell people. 

i haven't been able to say the words, ""i love you"" since i wa a small child. when family tell me that it's followed by a response of, ""you too."" i don't know what make it so hard to say. it just doesn't feel real. i want nothing more than to find someone i can genuinely say that to. and yet, it will never come. 

for years, i've just forced myself to be ok with my crushing loneliness, that it's just how life goes. but the past month it's been harder and harder to contain. i haven't cried this much in over ten years. the past 24 hour alone could rival the amount of tear i've produced in the rest of my life combined. it feel good in a strange way. but it doesn't solve anything. it just hurts.

it feel nice to write this down, even though i can't fully put it all into words. but this also solves nothing. my life will continue this way. i guess i just have to get back to compacting away my feeling soon.",anxiety
3299,"i am not in the best of mental state so forgive my rambling.i wa recently in a sort of situationship with a guy. we were casually sexting and chatting intermittently for 2 months, where i would panic and leave because i caught stronger feeling , but informing him,that i wa not paying attention to my mental health and professional life(both are in shambles) and wasn't ready to try to woo him and to ask him out even if he reject me. i think partly the reason wa i felt i wa inadequate for him and rejected myself before he could reject me, so he won't be disappointed and leave when he get to know i'm not good enough. but i kept coming back to him because i missed him, but kept leaving because i felt so pained that i couldn't do complete justice to him and my feelings. eventually, he ha moved on and gotten a girlfriend after 1 week of nc. we both had blocked each other but i unblocked him after calming down from my panic after knowing that he wa committed. i feel so so low.i lost him forever. i wish i had not missed the chance. i feel so pained that i hurt him by being a coward. what is this attachement style.how do i avoid running away next time with anyone? i want to avoid hurting more people with this behavior.

my relationship with friend is the complete opposite. i never leave them alone  until they tell me they need space if we had arguments.i dont particularly like confrontation but prefer immediate over cold shoulder.i take up their problem and my self worth depends on how much i help them, thus ignoring and avoiding my own issues.

i take my parent a lot for granted and my relationship with them, though close, isn't the best in term of what i provide. i'm not good enough a a child and argue often with them, and hurt their feeling at times.

3302,"hey guys, i have been an avid follower of this sub for a long time and this place ha been a constant source of panic attack reliever over the last few months. in my last session with my therapist, he told me that gad is cured after 6 month of literal hell and dedication. i want to share what worked for me.

**background:** a with my fellow gad sufferers, i have been suffering from constant worry and usual panic attack over the last few year but i decided to take action about this (didn't know it wa gad back then) after a full-blown attack that lasted for hour and hour in early may this year. started my treatment late may. in one of the panic attack i wa contemplating committing suicide but thank god i had the courage to stick to my routine. 

**symptoms:** luckily never had any physical symptom but diarrohea and mouth ulcer were common because of cortisol developed by amygdala. 

**aftermath:** i am waking up everyday with a buoyant mode and my life including social life, dating life and academic performance, all have improved!

so, let's finally begin:

1) **therapy:** can't emphasize this more, cbt therapist will identify the problematic and impractical thought pattern associted with your anxiety( especially if it's cortex-based) and suggest you way to cope with them via abcde, rrr technique and so on. some of these will work for you will and some not but these people are medical expert and you need to spend 2-3 month with a therapist before deciding to discontinue/move to a different therapist. self-therapy book do help but it's always better to have someone in the form of close friend or a therapist to assist in your journey.

2) **reading books:** rewire your anxious brain, the mindfulness and acceptance workbook for anxiety, and my age of anxiety,  are the top 3 book i recommend. finally, i'd suggest reading post on this sub. **caution:** there are chance of feeling uneasiness or having panic attack by reading few content so make sure you tell your brain that this is medicine beforehand

3) **meditation:** atleast 2-3 time in a day for 12.5 min everyday. it's only one day in the last 6 month i missed doing this wonderful thing.buddhist style of meditation worked for me. mantra meditation, guided meditation are other alternatives. there are wide variety of resource available online. it could be possible that you don't see the effect in the initial few week but i'd suggest keep doing it blindly. 

**4) gym:**  6 day a week non-stop in the last 6 month except for the week when i wa travelling. it's scientifically proven that doing physical activity for more than 20 min almost everyday improves mental health. technically, doing exercise help the body release endorphin that rearrange the synapse between the neuron if done for 10 week to see a significant results. this is massive in improving thought patterns

**5) being open:** being open about your anxiety with your closed one will enable to learn new strategies, perspective and many more things. more importantly, you will have shoulder to fall upon during a full-blown panic attack

**others:** practicing gratitude daily, practicing my hobbies( soccer).

i am new to mental health, im still making sense of it so i never really understood what i wa feeling. i always just thought it wa normalim starting to learn it not and i need to make a change.

i tend to ob over my goals, ive always been like that. eventually that started working against me and i fell into a cycle where i would spend a lot of timing thinking about my next move, whether or not i could achieve my goals, whether or not what i try next would work, etc etc. eventually i would work up the courage to actually take some action, but when thing didnt go a planned i would stop everything and go back into my head and plan and think and analyze. 

i would go back and forth so much i would work myself into these weird emotionalepisodes where i would be almost be driven to tears, questioning everything i wa doing, considering giving up on my dream and overall it just feel like im going insane. 

after the most recent episode of this, i thought about it and i realized that the only thing causing this wa my own thoughts. it wasnt even a response to anything that happened, it wa just me and my head. it pretty much always been that way. anytime this ha happened it came from me thinking. 

i really just want to understand what this is, so i can get it sorted and move on with my life. it make it so hard to actually take any action because getting out of my head and into the real world feel like such tremendous work it insane. the weird thing to me is this only really happens in regard to one area of my life, only career. is this anxiety?

3324,"so i am an anxious wreck. have been for all my life. every morning i wake up with severe anxiety, dirrahea(due to anxiety) and when i wa in school i would throw up due to the anxiety. 

regardless of those statement let's get on to the point and i will try and make it short. so i recently got a new job 3 week ago. it's a job where i have to talk  people over the phone and make sales. my bos and other coworkers claimed in order for me to get better they tell me ""stop being so timid, you need to learn to relax."" after hearing that it made it worse, so i decided to statt using my benzo script daily last week. i have had a benzodiazepine script for 8 years, but found out the best way not to get withdrawl and become dependant is use once every 4 day and it ha worked.

 even though this regimen works, i am always an anxious wreck on the day i don't take them and kind of judt accepted it at that point; the anxiety days. been doing this regimen for 4 years.

but after everyone always claiming i'm so anxious, timid, and whatnot i am considering daily usage, so that's why i came to this subreddit. 

should i just accept my fate and use daily for the rest of my life  if my anxiety is this bad?  and just disregard the withdrawl stories? i won't ever have to worry about withdrawl if i dose daily right? 

physical therapist said the same thing. (tore my acl a while back) she said ""why are you so timid and tight let me do my thing and stretch you out."" 

i'm sick of the anxiety and after 4 year of having 1-2 day out of the week anxiety free with that regimen i told you about. 

after i dosed my benzo daily with this new job last week. i got compliment from my boss, made massive sale and i can talk to people normally. 

haven't had a relationship in 8 year due to the anxiety. i only would go out on the day i would dose with that regimen i told you about. 

also don't try to explain other medication because if you list a medication i 100% guaruntee you i have tried it. from ssri, snri, maoi, gabapentin, buspar, wellbutrin, lyrica...you get the point there's more i didn't list..

3330,"my dog died from cancer dec 1st. last week we were told she had a uti and then on thursday she wa put to sleep because of internal bleeding. my dog are my world and my greatest supporter. i had talked to my psychiatrist last week about  how my anxiety is getting so bad i thought i needed to drop out of my college program. she said she didnt want me on any more med and wasn't helpful. 

ive been having some of the worst panic attack i've ever experienced, and i have had other traumatic thing happen to me, but this is the worst event in my life. i had asked to try busar for my panic attack the day she died but instead she upped my dose of seroquel! i take seroquel for major depression and suffer horrible side effect like hand tremor and sleeping 14 hour a day. she thought that while i'm struggling in college and grief that more seroquel would help! seroquel is not approved for anxiety or panic attacks, and i am scared whether to try the extra dose and fail school from sedation, or don't and risk losing control of my anxiety.

has anyone else had their doctor prescribe them seroquel for anxiety? i take adderall, tamsulosin, hydroxyzine, and pregablin so i don't see why she wouldn't have me quit the hydroxyzine that i take for daily anxiety for buspar, which is fda approved for panic attacks.

i think it's ridiculous how seroquel is used for so many off-label condition when it is a dangerous and strong medication. i've asked her to stop the seroquel after going the an urgent care for severe tremor and low bp, but since i had approved mental health since she started prescribing it, she want me to continue. the reason i felt better is i wa finally being treated for my add, which cause extreme social, personal life, and academic and work issue to the point i couldn't function in my day to day life.

3345,"hi guys, i wanted to preface this by saying i have severe health anxiety and tend to dwell on any perceived symptom i have.

so, for the last month, i have been extremely focused on my speech because i feel like there is something wrong with it. 

i feel like i slur certain words, and when i talk, my speech is jumbled and all over the place. 

i notice that i will occasionally use the wrong words, too, or say thing that dont make a lot of sense. 

for example: i wa trying to tell my dad amazon wa going to be dropping off a package later, and instead of saying that, i said amazon is going to be coming here to give me a package. 

does anyone else feel this way? can this all be attributed by anxiety?",anxiety
3346,"
i 26m am going through a rough patch atm i lost the space that wa crucial to running my business a well a came to the realization after working very hard for the last year and a half that i couldnt make my
car detailing business work from a financial perspective. i probably made about 10 or 20k in the last year which unfortunately isnt enough to live off of especially given the city i live in is amoung the most expensive in north america. it with this that i have realized that i am only getting further from reaching my goal one of them being buying myself my dream car which is a 10 year old f150. 

im pretty well stumped a to what i should do for work now a huge part of the reason i went to work for myself wa that for year i had struggled in many different work place a i wa subject to what felt like endless work place harassment and bullying. so going into a new workplace is very intimidating for me for that reason and it doesnt help matter that most of the job i can do will basically leave me nothing to live off of 50k where im from is basically nothing and i probably would even get close to that. 

i also broke up with my girlfriend of 3.5 month about a week or two ago. although i think i made the right choice in breaking up with her it hasnt helped matter and i miss her dearly. 

i also feel a though i dont have the support of my family it wa only a few day ago that i wa able to have a serious conversation with my mom about the going ons in my life for year she ha been to pre occupied with her set group or what my brother who life thousand of mile away is doing and anytime i needed to talk it wa inconvenient for her or she didnt have the patience. i started seeing a therapist a year ago and while that ha helped he not super available and sometimes i need to talk to someone in the moment. 

i have some support from my dad but i feel a though he is distancing himself a my mom did a few year ago which ha been extremely difficult. 

i wa looking at becoming a trucker but my parent where pretty well against it and i dont feel that i can take the leap without more support. 

im not sure what to do honestly i dont think i will ever be able to make a reasonable living and im having a very hard time grasping that a all my hope and dream are being crushed because of this reality. i guess in many way i have lost hope. im sort of questioning if i should sell my car buy my dream truck and drive down to florida which i really enjoy and maybe go visit my new nephew and my two niece in california maybe that will help me re evaluate thing and clear my head some more.

hi, i'm an eighteen-year-old boy and i am crazy

i noticed that something started to go wrong with me about 7 month ago when i got worried that my brain began to bleed because i hit my head very lightly

and even though my doctor said there wa nothing wrong with me, i still thought i had it so couldn't sleep because of it. 

and so i started having delusion that i smelled like sweat and that everyone wa lying to me when people said i didn't. 
because the fear that i smelled like sweat wa so extreme that i didn't go to school. 

at the same time i wa still so hyperactive, i drank alcohol very often and felt like i wa the king of the world and hardly slept at all until everything went to hell and now i am in a period where i have no feeling and find no meaning to life. 

i don't remember much from when i wa so hyperactive either. the anxiety is still there but i don't feel it in the same way a i did when i wa extremely hyperactive. then my anxiety flew over my body. now it feel like the anxiety is heavy and i have started showering three time a day changing my shirt during the day to avoid having panic attack which i had a lot of before

at first it wa barely noticeable but since the end of last year the level of pain and the number of time they occur ha grown substantially.
for the past six month i have left the house only four time and this wa to seek treatment all of which wa of no help. doctor put me on medication to treat nerve damage since they thought it wa some form of neuropathy but it wasn't since test confirmed it. i wa also tested for other condition such a diabetes but the test came out clean leading the doctor to believe the cause is anxiety.
leaving the house during the day is extremely painful because the heat from the sun make thing worse. this is the same case when i'm around any heat source. even my own body heat or heat generated from activity such a eating or exercising elicit this pain.
another thing that cause these sensation is experiencing emotions. being happy,sad, embarrassed or any other feeling cause me physical pain. 
the pain never leaves. it start when i wake up and even when i sleep it is still lingering because on most night it disrupts my sleep.

ive dealt with severe anxiety since i wa 10 year old, and i am 33 year old now and these last few year ha magnified it.  all i have been able to do is just endure, with no results. i eat healthy and live a physically active lifestyle, and im told im a good looking guy. nobody would know what i deal with when they see me, but it feel like a constant state of suffering. anxiety ha gotten to the point where it ha effected every aspect of my life from a relationship to jobs. getting up is hard, going to the gym is hard, doing anything that should be fun to me feel like a chore. i get no enjoyment out of anything in life. what really suck is im a pretty goofy guy and love to joke, but anxiety seems to have changed my entire personality where i cant even do that because i am in a constant state of survival. i look serious all the time and i guess i am because i am seriously fighting just to survive.

i just got a new job and im in training but i woke up sick this morning, so im going to have to tell them i cant come in monday for a specific training course. because it not like i can be around people when im showing clear sign of the flu or covid w/e this is. thats very bad timing, and i have never had to miss work for something like this. especially for a job i just started. i just hope it doesnt fall through completely and im back to square one looking for work before i run out of money. my anxiety ha been so bad that there were few point where i had to go month on savings, and i wa finally able to summon the strength to get a job now. 

i also guess my immune system is pretty compromised right now with the new experience ive faced the last couple of weeks, physical and mental exertion, and being in an environment where there are around 400 people around me and interaction with them. 

ive listened to anxiety podcasts, self help books, but i havent seen much relief. just a sudden spark of motivation that it possible to feel any differently

i dont know what can even be done. every day feel like misery. i feel empty. i even feel paranoid like everyone hate even when they have first seen me. i form the worst thought i should be able to laugh and joke with people and live my true personality, but i cant. ive always thought nutrition and exercise could help, which ive lived consistently for 18 years, but i cant even go to the gym without feeling like an empty shell. every day i think about not being here. 

maybe im to the point where some sort of medication could benefit me. ive heard it mess with your sex drive, but i have an extremely high sex drive anyway and it doesnt matter because i dont get to use it because i feel i cant meet woman at the moment a im not whole, a well a it feeling impossible under my circumstances.

i initially started seeking therapy because i wa getting terrible paranoid thought and anxiety over having a roommate in college. it had started affecting the way i ate, slept, and even stuff like going to class.

i know there are many people out there to say to give your therapist a chance, and so i plan to meet up with them again. however, the first session seemed a bit off, to the point where i felt hopeless after and cried about it. i have been struggling with anxiety, and they highlighted trauma and what's causing the way thing are currently, but i felt like they were saying stuff that, i have already known about myself for a long time. 

they then offered solution i have already done. i told them i still get bad thought and it didn't help me. i am constantly aware of my thoughts, it's just my action still continue to be the same, regardless or not i am aware of how i am thinking. 

after the session, i wa left with no solution and they asked if i wanted to talk again. i said i needed time to think. 

i'm not sure what to do. is it normal to feel this way after a session? should i continue seeing this therapist? i'm not sure if this is relevant, but before this, i saw that they were a ladc and specialized in drug and substance abuse. i wa a little skeptical, but i wa convinced they could have still helped me. but now i feel hopeless. what should i do?",anxiety

3386,"i wanted to come on here and share my own story, hoping to help others who struggle with health anxiety or going through having panic attacks. i had a great start to this year which quickly started to turn into a downfall. i wa talking to this amazing woman who eventually started to become distant with me about 3 month of getting closer together. we talked about it and we promised we would end thing and not just ghost each other. turn out my gut feeling wa right and it happened. a day later, i had my first panic attack. i found out that i had a low platelet count and a enlarged spleen. month continue to pas and my anxiety continued to spiral downward. i started to develop serious acid reflux symptom such a belching, dizziness, brain fog after meal while still dealing with my other health issue going on. i wa referred to an oncologist in july to see if there wa anything serious going on with my health. after another ultrasound in late august and extensive blood work, everything came back normal. however, my acid reflux symptom were still present pretty significantly. i just took on a second job to help me get over the struggle of being ghosted to keep my mind off it. turn out i developed more anxiety from it and i would have panic attack almost every shift there. i had to stop working there. two week later, i had a lot of jaw discomfort and had to get all 4 wisdom teeth removed. i quickly lost so much weight and wa nervous it wa something serious and continued to have panic attack and trip to the er. er would always re assure me that i am young, healthy, and nothing is wrong with me but i am still feeling major symptom of anxiety. i started to quickly avoid leaving my house at all costs. i didnt hang with my friends, didnt exercise, and i just started to give up. it got so bad a lot of my friend had to come by and talk to me because this wasnt me. i finally had a courage to seek therapy. ever since i started therapy, thing have slowly been getting better. i started to go out again, i learned how to manage my symptom and continue with my day. i took on fear such a going to the grocery store, going to work, and going out with friend and having a good time. i still get symptom to this day and some day are good and some day are bad. but i have never felt a bad a i did since my lowest moment. i continue to deal with acid reflux and i have a gi endoscopy scheduled for january. till then, i try to manage my symptom with good diet, lot of walks, lot of self affirmation and self care. some day are better than others, but all we can do is keep pushing forward. i hope this can inspire some people that you arent alone. i went from the most active and happiest person to the lowest ive been in my life. when it rains, it pours. sometimes you just need to find the strength to keep going, or reach out to people who care. i still am on this journey and i still have my moment where i have a pulse ox with me whenever i go or ill check my blood pressure when i get dizzy. but not a much a before. reach out to me if you need someone to talk to. im here for all of you a we continue on this journey together",anxiety

it start with this weird pressure in my head that come in waves, then i start to get black spots/blurred vision. it feel like i'm teetering the line of consciousness and i start to get really dizzy. it just happened to me a few minute ago, and one of my eye is still blurry from it.

3398,"i have struggled with depression, anxiety and substance misuse most of my life (im 33). over the last 5 year ive made good progress in understanding myself and my past better and taken step to improve my life and carve out a path forward that hopefully will minimise my suffering. i no longer drink or do drugs. i have a solid meditation and yoga practice. home life is good, caring partner, secure housing and stable income. ive been making great progress in my career and found the spark for what i do for work again. on the surface everything appears to be going great. my depression and anxiety still fluctuates and i only recently clawed my way out of a severe encounter with depression.

however one constant over the last 5-10 year in particular despite whether or not im going through a rough patch or not are encounter with panic attack (or at least thats what i will refer to them as). im not sure if that is actually what it is because it doesnt really fit the picture in my mind of what a panic attack should look like. so i will just describe a few example of what i experience and id be happy to hear any comments, coping strategy or similar experience that may help me understand this hurdle i cant seem to overcome.

settings this typically occur in include social interactions, in particular work related situations. for example the most recent experience i wa having a performance review (everything wa great, so nothing to panic about right?). early on in the conversation a soon a i feel the focus and attention on me i freeze completely, it feel like my throat is about to close up, my heart is racing, i cant talk properly because my mouth is very dry and i have difficulty swallowing. i get serious brain fog and struggle formulating a sentence. i get very very hot and flushed, my ear and face turned red (its super embarrassing which make it worse). for the most part i can make it through the conversation okay  somehow but after it pass i always feel very flat, defeated, embarrassed and burnt out. the same symptom can occur at any time in other situation like during a presentation, meeting someone for the first time, or anytime i feel like i have a spotlight on me.

ive spoken to my gp about this a while ago and he suspected agoraphobia and referred me to a psychologist and i spent 12 month working on attachment theory. while that wa great for dealing with other things, these panic attack have still persisted. it really frustrating because i feel like im doing all the right thing and yet these occurrence are really debilitating. it prevents me from speaking up in situation and i avoid certain interaction completely. at the same time, i understand avoiding these thing hold me back in career progression etc and if only i could overcome it maybe id be more confident. but every time i try the experience of the panic attack just discourages me completely.

i am also autistic and have trouble with social cue and interpretation, which is potentially being made worse due to the fact the people i am talking to i havent seen irl for a bit (i know them outside the internet). the other people i am talking to are also autistic. while this mean they understand me more. i have been so used to being around people who are not autistic so i have the instinct to be hyper vigilant regardless. even though when i saw them in person i wa not anxious (i have le of this with one because we are dating, though at first i wa really worried about messing it up). 

but then again, this flare up is recent, even though i do have anxiety overall. 

over the past couple day all of a sudden, i have been panicked multiple time that i accidentally said something to make someone upset. and off of that, i keep making sure and asking whether or not i did. i have also been apologizing a lot. more than i need to. i dont think asking each time is very helpful, and especially with apologizing when i dont need to. because it turn out they werent upset, but im still worried that in trying to make sure they arent upset that i actually made them upset. especially just recently with a message i got. i wa told it wasnt my fault, but i still feel like i did do something very wrong.

3428,"ive always wanted to drive now it the scariest thing ive done and i feel a tho no one understands me unless theyre in the same exact situation. i feel like students, new driver or anxious driver are the bane of normal driver existence. like they hate u for not being great a soon a we step into a car for the first time. all the time i see on social medium people ripping on student driver for being bad and how they shouldnt be on the road along with more terrible things.  i get so freaked out about what other people think, i cant drive. when i can drive i think im an ok driver and could have my license but my fear is so strong it extremely hard for me to get in the car. it effecting my life at this point, i cant think about it without sweating and once a panic attack, i cant get a job to have money and i cant see my friend or get out of my house to do something other then lay in bed.

3429,"a month ago i experienced the first seizure i've ever had (a tonic clonic), and next to it being the most terrifying thing to ever happen in my life, i couldn't turn to anyone for any sort of comfort/support, because i'm alone. a couple day after that, i ended up catching covid for the first time, and despite how badly it ravaged my already weakened mind/body, i still couldn't turn to anyone for any sort of comfort/support, because i'm alone. and in the same week that both of these awful thing happened, my birthday also took place, but nobody noticed or cared, because i'm alone. for week afterwards i suffered terribly from long covid and additional seizure of the focal variety, and throughout it all, i could only lay there, arm wrapped around my own body, whispering whatever little comfort i could give to myself, like a man freezing in the dark clinging to a tattered blanket for warmth. 

in the past, i used to have a couple people i spoke with online, but depression and the assortment of other mental illness i suffer from made me isolate myself completely. i've never had any irl friends. 

now, after everything that's happened to me this past month, i feel like i'm scrambling all at once to try and reach out to other people, and i'm glad to say that i've met a couple nice individual this way, but they can only talk to me so much, and for most of the day i just sit completely alone in my room, lonely and scared like i've never been before. what's worse though, is how the more i need other people, the more that push them away. i don't want to be a buzzkill, or desperate, or clingy, or needy, but it's really hard not to be when you're in a crisis, yet regardless that doesn't make it any le repellent.   

if i were a normal person, unburdened by chronic depression, i could've at least had good friend and a loving partner to help me through this whole ordeal, but instead i've had to largely go through it alone. because i've always been so depressed and neurotic, i haven't had the ability to form any sort of connection to other people. this right here is the worst trap life can set for you, since once a crisis hit you, especially of the medical variety, you have no one else other than yourself to see you through it, and let me tell you, that just isn't enough.

3441,"i am a long time sufferer of anxiety. my earliest memory of anxiety go all the way back to first grade and continued all throughout school. i never got involved in activities, and dropped out of college twice because of it. 

i did ok for a while and then around 2008 or 2009, after some issue with a coworker of mine, it flared the worst that it had ever been. i decided that i wa time to seek professional help and started seeing a psychiatrist. over the past decade we've tried almost a dozen different med and two different therapists, and nothing ha helped. 

i joined the local volunteer fire department back in 2002. it wa something that i wa always interested in and an opportunity presented itself so i took it, and i eventually became an emt a well. after being on the department for about 10 years, my anxiety once again started flaring up. every time we got a call, i would almost have a panic attack, and it got to the point that i stopped running call and eventually resigned. i wa on medication for anxiety during the last several year of my time with the department. 

about ten year ago i had to quit the warehouse job i wa working due to back issues. i got a job at the local grocery store that i worked at in high school and have worked my way up to meat department manager. none of this wa through me actively trying. one of the meat cutter quit about seven year ago and they asked me if i'd like to take his place. then, about five year ago the meat department manager retired and they just kind of gave the job to me. i'm really more of a glorified meat cutter than anything else, a i don't have the ability to hire or fire anyone (not that i'd want to anyway). however, i am in charge of ordering everything that we need for the department and i have to keep on top of price change and thing like that. 

much like with the fire department, i thought exposing myself to people and situation would help with my anxiety and people skills. it also ha only made thing worse. i have constant anxiety worrying about what type of interaction i'm going to have with customer and coworkers throughout the day; how many rude and difficult people i'm going to deal with or people that can't or don't want to understand why i can't do certain thing (mostly due to cross contamination) or why i don't have a certain product. i wake up multiple time a night and can't get back to sleep because of worrying. 

i have gone over dozen of scenario in my head a to how something may play out. question that customer may ask, thing they want done, etc. every single time i'm put in that position, even if it happens exactly like i had planned, my mind go completely blank and i fumble through the entire conversation. i have never had a situation turn out like i wanted. every one of them end awkwardly with me not saying or doing anything resembling what i wanted. i have always been afraid of confrontation and dealing with people every day ha not helped at all.

3458,"tw: death, health problems

so i guess imma go on a vent/rant about the shit on my head. it is gonna be long, so don't sweat if you don't feel like reading it . 

but i can't be the only one who is just so anxious about anything happening to them. like i guess i have so much time on my hand to be going through other people's post about their health concern and how even young people have seriously life changing problem that sometimes they don't make it. but it can also be a learning experience for others to be aware of shit in their body. 

to give a little background, i've been living a sedentary lifestyle for about 3 month problably. male 22, so yes young, but doesn't mean something bad could still happen because of my life choice right now, and what i've done before. 

i'm glad and praise to god for being able to wake up every morning while others don't make it for their own reason (not trying to shame on anyone). but that doesn't mean that the end isn't around the corner for you, ya know?

but here's a list of shit that's on my head i'd like to share with yall, if you cared enough to read up to here, i appreciate it, and if you don't it's okay, everyone got problems. but this:

if your genetically fucked you can develop blood clot early on. you can get pe, ha, stroke, etc. 

your artery can slowly be getting blocked without you even knowing. 

and you can also get an aneurysm, different type actually. brain, abdomen, etc.

seizures are a thing a well. 

oh i almost forgot, sudden cardiac arrest. 

bro the amount of disease and infection out there, how some can even go unnoticed with no symptoms, and only show until it's too late. 
how someone treat covid like it's normal but then there are others who die from it . 

bruh and then if your anxiety is really bad you can develop physical symptom without even being anxious. so now your brain is tricking you into making something hurt when really nothing is wrong...so how are you supposed to know when something is actually wrong, and not anxiety? 

cancer...cancer is just underneath heart disease for most leading cause of death in the us. my boy...cancer is like the secret stage of a bos fight in life that you dont wanna unlock. ""oh shit look at you big dawg, survived another day of life huh...proud of you my man...ayo what if i just clump up your cell in a random part of your body and you won't notice it until it further advanced and could be too late "" it's like death is playing with dart and wherever he land on your body that's where it'll grow, like what. 

i mean given that a lot and i mean a lot of thing are carcinogen to the environment, i can see why cancer can happen so often. and yeah sure maybe some thing are low risk...but how many ""low risk"" object are by you on a day to day basis? probably enough where it'll stack up at some point if one is not careful. what's the range of people getting it? like between 1-2 people will develop cancer in their lifetime. and don't worry if you don't get it, heart disease is around the corner big dawg, good luck, like bruh how the fuc-

and if you ever do get it, let alone the pain you'd have to under go when treating cancer, that's due to the type and where it's at, so hope that you can get rid of it. i heard treatment for cancer can cause future problem relating to cardiac arrest and shit like that . so it's just a trail of problem from there. 

oh man, and then there's surgery. so yes you get surgery whenever there's and underlying problem that need fixing. so let's say it go well after being under the table for however long it takes. and then there's complication that could occur after surgery. and then you can have multiple for whatever is the occasion. 

and given, if you were gifted good genetics for one thing, it probably won't even matter because you'll be weak to other thing a well. hey i mean good for the people who live up to 70 and over and stayed smoking and drinking plenty without being worried too much. but bro i swear i'm sure there's someone out there who smoked one cigarette and it sped up the process of something forming in them, like bruhhhh.

oh man and let's just talk about the mistake human can make. i respect doctors, and everything they do for putting themselves in a position where they are in charge of other people's lives. but man i can't tell if some people's destiny's where meant to be killed by heart disease or what. cause yall can't tell me there hasn't been time where the doctor ha told someone ""yeah everything look good and running smoothly"" and then a week or so later whatever you got checked out for end up fucking you over and that's it. like is that faith at that point or a mistake on the doc part, or not every test you do is going to be accurate in given you the reason you are having pain? 

bro, you can die from having an orgasm? like..dead ass...why bro. you can burst a vessel when you ejaculate, like how bad doe life hate on you bro

dementia, yes this may happen later on life. but in general mental disorder ain't no game to play with. if your not stable you can not get anything done. if anything you'll probably drive yourself to insanity and maybe, just maybe you'll end up becoming something bad and take others out, or just pull the trigger on yourself. 

it's okay i'm almost done with this rant. i genuinely feel like life is just a test run of what you get done in this life that show wether your good or bad, and i'm hoping when we die that our soul get transported to a different body, like reincarnation. or maybe we'll stay the same we just travel to another version of us, like a different universe. or maybe we never die and stay in this same life, or maybe there's nothing at the end. and yes i'm sober while typing all this. 

again i'm not asking for death, nor i want to feel pain of my heart giving out or a pe or something excruciatingly painful if i were to go out. but man since i still am undergoing my own health problem with a tight chest that come and goes, tremor that happen throughout my body, i just don't feel comfortable anymore stepping outside to do anything. which is garbage because obviously you need to have a job and support yourself for everything. and you can't even stay still because that further lead to more bad shit happening, like developing a blood clot. 

moral of this, life really ain't fair. if anyone want to propose some day to day thing one should be doing to prevent certain thing from happening to them, please go ahead and leave a reply and i'll read them. shit be tough out here for real.",anxiety

3460,"vent/advice needed: over the course of the last five year my anxiety and overthinking ha gotten really bad. in the last two year (due to the death of my father) ive even suffered from the occasional panic attack. i went a year without having one and had two within the last couple of months. these recent panic attack and my overthinking have been triggered by my relationship. were engaged, weve been together for 1.5 year and he check off all the proverbial boxes. he wa even supportive during my last panic attack and is always willing to listen to my thought pattern during an anxiety attack. however, my mind keep on telling me that something with him is sketchy and i shouldnt trust him and he only with me out of an ulterior motive and he doesnt find me attractive. in my spiraling, all these thing make perfect sense to me. 
okay, here where i have the most trouble: i know he like to mast*rb*te in the shower and since living with each other, i am hyper aware of when he go into the shower. he can be in there for more than an hour and he even added a little sitting stool. he take his phone in there with him too. i overthink the f*ck out of it because i dont know what he watching or anything. my anxiety tell me that he talking to other woman during this time or watching something that he think i wouldnt like or something (sometimes, like tonight, he went to take a shower while im asleep and in the middle of the night). 
for example, tonight, i woke up around midnight to an empty bed and sure enough he wa in the restroom. i texted him to ask if he wa okay and he said he wa and that he wa going to take a shower. i wa immediately suspicious. when i heard the shower turn on, i walked in and used the restroom and asked him if i could join him. he said of course but i felt like he wa hiding the front side of the naked body from me. i felt extremely anxious and felt like i wa bothering him. i hopped into the shower with him but he didnt say a word. i kept on trying to read his face but nothing. he had sat down on the tile while i sat on the stool. he caught me staring and i felt so weird. i then said, i apologize. i feel like i cut into your me time he said it wa okay and i quickly washed myself and then left the bathroom. 
weve been living with each other for about half a year now and this ha continued to be a thing. ive talked to him about it and (due to another reason that i dont want to share) i asked him not to m*sterb*ate in the shower while im in the house. at this point, i dont think he ha respected that but i guess thats out of my control.

3464,"ok so 2 week ago i went to the er for the first time a an adult for a panic attack. had them before but this wa so physical. then i had all the physical symptom for a week until i ate some klonopin for a few days. like couldn't work, sleep or move i wa so sick. pain in extremities, numbness, zaps, brain fog, nausea, weakness - normally could do like 20 pushups, would get woozy and faint after 3. couldn't even stretch. super sweaty, like soak the sheet and pillow sweaty for like a week. thought i had ms.

now for context i used to drink anywhere up to 4 large coffee a day with 0 issue other than being jittery, but happy and secure jittery. maybe a little sweaty. even the day before the er, nothing bad.

to try and get well i stopped consuming anything that may cause or exacerbate anxiety or panic. i cold turkey quit weed after 18 year of almost daily smoking, had like 7 day of the last 14 off caffeine the day i had one coffee, moderate anxiety all day. looking to quit the vape a well.

anyway this morning i had to be somewhere and knew i wa a tiny bit backed up and decided to have a coffee so i could poo. had had 3 totally sober days, no anything other than water and healthy food with no anxiety and decided to roll the dice and have a coffee.

instant panic, not a bad a the er or any of that week but it wa still awful like i started my jiu jitsu class and wa sweating profusely and shaking within 5 min of warm ups. luckily i'd felt it and took a klonopin but even after getting home and chilling for a few hour it wa still there and i wa just exhausted. slept for 3 hour on the couch. woke up drained.

basically i think my body is allergic to caffeine    now, swith ha been flicked by this event, probably weed too, too scared to try. i think i have to ban myself from my 2 favourite treats.

has this happened to anyone? like a major anxiety event just permanently making caffeine or weed (or anything else) total no go after many year without issue?

long story...

three year ago, i lost my cat (she wa almost 13 year old and her kidney were failing). i lost my best friend and it hurt a lot when i had to let her go. she wa part of my life for 12 years. she always knew when i wa sad and she would always stay by my side to cheer me up. 

my boyfriend got a kitten not long after my cat's death and he helped me heal so much. i loved him like he wa my own. 

last year, my boyfriend and i saw his young cat (he wasn't even 3 year old) just randomly die in our arms. we asked for an autopsy and we learned that he had a rare heart disease and his heart just gave out. it wa horrible and traumatizing to hold his lifeless body. it's crazy because he wa so full of life that same morning. 

his death broke me and since then, i have an obsession with death. i just feel so scared to wake up one day and find my boyfriend dead. or sometimes i panic and feel like i'm gonna die. i felt like this everyday for a month or two after the horrible day. after a couple of months, i started to feel gradually better. my boyfriend and i moved in together at the beginning of this year. 

five month after my boyfriend's cat died, we decided to open our home to a new cat. she wa a young mama cat, 1 year 2 months. we had an instant connection, she wa so sweet and loving. i wa so happy with her in my life, but she developed the fip (feline infectious peritonitis). we tried the ""illegal"" treatment, but it didn't work. she died 4 month after we adopted her. she died in our home and it wa an horrible scene. now i'm just always reminded of her death when i'm at home. 

what is making me incredibly angry is that my cat's vet wa incompetent and negligent. she didn't help make my cat better, she made her worst. 

the same week i adopted her, i took an appointment to the vet to see if she wa healthy (it took about 6 week to get an appointment)

vet said everything wa perfect, except for a little infected wound on her paw. she cleaned it poorly, left lot of hair and blood in the way and told me to clean it twice daily for 2 weeks. well, since she did such a poor job, the wound wouldn't heal. i had to go back to the clinic so she could clean it again, since it wa still infected. but she never apologized, she never showed her face. it wa a technician who took my cat in the back. 

i'm pretty sure this is what triggered the fip.

a week after, my cat got sick, so we went back to the clinic. the vet diagnostic wa cancer and she sent u to see an oncologist in another town. she wa 100% sure of her diagnostic and didn't explore other things. she never mentioned the fip. so we were completely clueless. it took 3 week to get an appointment with the oncologist.

the oncologist knew right away that it wasn't cancer and wa almost wondering why we were sent there. he did some test and confirmed my cat developed the fip.

my cat's vet never owned up to her mistake and it's making me so angry. i tried to deal with the situation with the clinic's owner, but he wa an asshole and tried to make me look like the bad guy. i mentioned many time in my email the poor job done when the vet cleaned my cat's paw but he just ignored it. he did give me the vet's email address in the end. i wrote her what i needed to tell her and showed her proof of the bad job she did cleaning her paw. but she answered me with some bullshit, didn't say anything about my cat's wound on the paw and she didn't take any responsibility for her actions. she wa just deflecting what i wa saying. 

my cat died 6 month ago, but the anger i feel is still there because i didn't get any justice for her. some days, it still hurt me so much when i think about it. my boyfriend never really supported me in all of this. he didn't want me to write my complaint to the clinic. it made me feel quite lonely to not even be able to talk to him about it. 

i could make an official complaint to the vet association, but i'm not sure it's gonna go my way. i do have proof (photos) of the shit job the vet did when she ""treated"" her paw. 

i just don't know if i have the energy to go through all of this. i think i just need to let go and move on.

i love cat so much and i would like to adopt another one in the future, but i'm just so scared it will die young too. and i'm gonna have a hard time trusting any vet. 

it's just so exhausting to fear death all the time. i wish i could just be normal and wake up in the morning without thinking about it.

3504,"for the past few weeks, ive been struggling to sleep despite my exhaustion. it gotten so bad that a couple hour before going to sleep, ill usually end up experiencing a random panic attack that make me so jumpy that even when my arm drop or i move too suddenly, my body will feel a quick amount of panic and dizziness will usually ensue. it wa really bad last night to the point where even now i still feel that slight amount of anxiety and dizziness if im too frantic. though the dizziness end there, no general disorientation while living my life. i have a hard time sleeping alone now because of it. ill usually wake up anxious and feeling multiple different symptom like sleep apnea breathing issues, my body tensing up, my leg twitching and very rarely itll end up freezing or tighten up my face a a way to force me to wake up. everytime this happens ill usually check the mirror or check my function to see if i had a stroke or a seizure since those have been my biggest fear lately. no sign of genuine weakness in my body besides from my body part feeling tired or exhausted. i asked the doctor before to see if it something to worry about but he said that it could be me being worried at night and anxiety keeping my body riled up despite it being tired. but it got me really scared last night, where when i tried to make myself sleep, i felt the right side of my face tighten up completely and feel like it struggled to open.. but it still opened and relaxed once i forced myself awake. i tried to calm myself back down and go back to sleep and it swapped to the left side of my face.. and it ended up keeping me up for a while until my body could calm down enough to where i felt comfortable enough to sleep. i ended up making it through the night after that, but i felt like the right side of my face felt tired or tight, despite still being able to do everything just fine. no blurry vision, no struggle breathing, no struggle eating or drinking either. i ended up seeing my psychiatrist today and asked them if it wa anything to worry about since she used to help out patient with stroke and seizures.. and they said that it looked completely fine by the short exam she gave me. she also said that since i dont have a history of seizure and i had clean blood results, that i shouldnt be too scared about it and not worry unless it actually becomes debilitating. so they got me some new anxiety medication and sent me on my way along with a therapist appointment. im also getting an mri done within two weeks, but for now, i find sleep impossible to enjoy unless im with someone i know.. even then sometimes ill struggle staying asleep because my fear will travel into my dream and feel like my body is unbelievably weak and helpless until i wake up and realize it wa just my dream. so now it is 9 pm, i gotta work tomorrow, my anxiety is already starting to rise and just typing this and moving my arm sometimes to relax it cause my body to feel weird and i know in the next 3 hour when i try to sleep, im gonna fight for my life trying to stay calm and manage to get at least some hour of sleep tonight. im so tired of fighting with anxiety and feeling all alone in this battle.",anxiety

3514,"would really appreciate some advice a im at a bit of a loss and very desperate for help. it a long story so tia if you read it. 

back in mid october i (33f) got a nasty shock. i started experiencing some tenderness/burning downstairs one evening and decided to have a look. found some general redness and a small mark that looked like an abrasion. no other symptoms, except possibly pee-ing a bit more than usual.

i had (stupidly) had unprotected sex about six week prior to noticing this (with someone i would probably deem high risk, a i later found out he wa v promiscuous) which i wa already feeling uneasy about  so i immediately panicked and went down a rabbithole researching herpes, 100% convinced i had it. it wa my first sexual encounter in 2.5 year so this made it even more devastating to contemplate. i booked the first doctor appointment i could find.

however by the time i saw the doctor 36 hour later, the mark had totally disappeared and i just had residual soreness (though how much of that wa psychosomatic, i dont know). the doctor examined me and said everything looked totally perfect but performed a pcr swab test anyway, and prescribed me antiviral for a week just in case. the swab came back negative (though ive read that these are only really reliable if taken from an active lesion). all other std and yeast test came back negative.

i have seen four different doctor and been examined multiple time in the ensuing seven weeks. i have shown them photo of the abrasion and 3 out of 4 of them said it did not look at all like herpes, and that it wa probably just irritation, friction, or a scratch. one of them said it looked a little suspicious and *could* be herpes  but wa not typical and could have been caused by many things. all of them are saying my main problem here is health anxiety and my gp ha prescribed me prozac (which i havent started yet). 

i have felt ongoing sensations/discomfort downstairs since i noticed the sore and have been in a living hell, reading about how life ruining the diagnosis is for most people due to the stigma. i dont know how much of the discomfort is in my head and how much is real, a ive been hyper fixated on the area and extremely distressed and anxious. i got a prescription for a few month worth of antiviral from an online pharmacy and have been taking one a day in case i have it. 

i desperately want to be wrong but after spending too much time researching and reading on herpes forum ive convinced myself ive probably got it. im petrified my hope for love/marriage is on the brink of collapse and horrified that it would be all my fault  this permanent penalty for a fleeting mistake after a lifetime of being careful. ive been too scared to shave, too scared to wear my swimsuit (thats tight/causes a bit of friction), and scared to get my period because ive read all these thing can cause outbreaks. every itch or tingle spin me out. i am not exaggerating when i say it been horrific and the biggest personal/mental health crisis of my life.

the advice from the doctor ha basically been: youre fine, move on, get treatment for health anxiety. one of them told me to come off the valtrex (as i could be taking it for nothing) and that way if i did have it i might have another outbreak and then ill know for sure (though again she doesnt think it likely). the thought of waiting for another outbreak that may or may not come to confirm this is awful.

all of them have advised against getting the herpes serology (blood) test, a these are being phased out in my country due to the lack of accuracy/prevalence of false positive and they think it could do more harm than good. however if i really want it, i can get it.

pros of getting it would be: it might show i am negative, and i can then somewhat relax. or i find out i have it, and can take myself off the dating market so i dont pas it on. con of getting it are: i could get a low (potentially false) positive (driving me crazier than i already feel with the ambiguity), or a high/definite positive result  and have my self worth and future hope destroyed. 

what would you do in this situation? do i just stop the antiviral and hope for the best and try to live with the ambiguity? do i risk my sanity by going for the bloodwork? it feel my mental health is at major risk no matter which way i turn here. it unbearable and i wish every day i could turn back time.",anxiety
3515,"i believe i have panic attack occasionally. theyre usually triggered by something, and can come in one of two forms, oftentimes with both together. one style mostly involves stomach cramp and general nervousness. it seems to be triggered by situation in which i feel awkward or out of place. it might be more accurate to term this a an anxiety episode, but i dont really know a lot of the jargon for this sort of thing. 

the other style is more serious. it like having really bad chills. it triggered by all sort of thing (cold air, being in the water, the changing of the seasons) and is honestly borderline debilitating. my thought feel like theyre going haywire and ill sometimes find myself cry a part of it without a clear reason a to why (for context, im a 31 year old male manual laborer, not wildly tough or anything but i havent cried for a normal reason in probably over a decade). 

the first style isnt much of a problem for me. it obnoxious, but ive dealt with this my entire life. meditation and breathing exercise tend to keep them pretty well in check. 

the other though is a newer development. they first started around ten year ago, but in the past couple of year theyve ramped up dramatically, especially after the birth of my daughter four month ago. being a father now, i cant be falling into a shivering mess every time it get chilly  god forbid there any kind of an actual crisis. im at the point now that i think i need to do something more about this. 

im thinking some kind of mild medication is probably my best answer, though id like to rely a little on medication a possible. something i can take when these bad panic attack come on, but hopefully something non-narcotic. i dont want to be popping xanax and falling asleep or anything either.

it's these odd feeling like the entire world is closing in on me and this fear that my emotion are on the brink of spiraling out of control. even though they never do and i'm pretty high functioning and normal, the anticipation that they eventually will is almost debilitating. i also feel this intense fear that i'm just going to suddenly drop dead or that i'll enter some wierd psychosis or something even though i have zero symptom of either of those thing happening. also, there's this odd feeling of being afraid of everything for no reasons. i'm afraid of the chair i'm sitting on, the air i'm breathing, the causual word someone is saying to me, etc. when i try putting into word why im afraid of these thing i can't. there's literally no reason. i'm just afraid. 

what's most bizarre is they don't seem to be caused by anything. the thought just appear out of nowhere or i just feel this way for no reason and they just linger. i noticed these odd feeling pop up a little le than a day before i started getting sick with the flu (which wa 4 day ago) and so i'm hoping they just fade away a i start getting better.

finally this year i turned 35 and had started to feel more optimistic about things, my medication wa doing wonder and i wa ready to take on the world. i started small doing thing i liked such a going and playing a card game at local gaming stores. once i felt comfortable with that i decided it wa time: i needed to try to work again. so back in mid-october i applied a a janitor/housekeeping for a casino (not vegas) and a lot of people in my inner circle were skeptical of my decision of such a large jump.

3540,"i'm a 22 year old trans guy, who is not taking testosterone yet and is semi passing until i speak up. i dont feel comfortable walking at night, but it ha become part of my routine since ive found a warehouse job. i have to commute there with train, when i get there it already dark outside. the longer way to the warehouse take around 15 minutes, but there is a shortcut that allows me to be there in 5 minute - unfortunately, the shortcut ha no street lights, it completely pitch black with some bush surrounding me and i have to carry a flashlight to not stumble. 

dark alley thing take only about 2 minute and after some additional walking im near my work place, but i'm always extremely anxious while i have to go through there. my mind start racing and in that moment my panicking brain is certain that there is someone in the bush waiting to kill me or rob me, even though there's probably never anyone there. the anxiety start before i have to go into the alley and even when im still in the train - i'm thinking that maybe this time something will happen to me, and it scary and absurd every time. it like im convincing myself im going to die tonight.

 going the longer route doesnt help, because this or other way im still walking through industrial district with only windowless van driving around the street and other worker commuting from and to work, so id rather take the (subjectively) scary shortcut and be over with walking, also simply sometimes im just too tired to take the longer route. i live in germany, i dont think realistically i have anything to fear about, many people say that this is even one of the safest city in already safe germany. but there is always this quiet, paranoid voice in my head, asking: what if this time someone happens? what if you are going to become this very little statistic?

3543,"i started making the app, lungy (https://www.lungy.app), during the first wave of covid. it wa a very stressful time for everyone and i wanted an alternative to other breathing and meditation apps. the idea is that rather than closing your eye and zoning out, lungy is about focusing and tuning into your surroundings and noticing the beauty of the world around you, so all the visuals are nature inspired or have some reference to the physical world. i wanted the app to be empowering in some way too  even if you feel powerless, you can still have a positive influence on the world with just your breath. the visuals react in real-time to breath and touch, which give something peaceful and relaxing to focus on. it feature lot of different breathing exercises, with a combination of white and brown noise to help you sleep.

i woke up from the panic, and the first thing i thought about wa when i wa the exact same age a the the little girl in my dream i remember my dad picking me up from school and a white van full of undercover police coming to take him because he wa involved in some crime. and his personal driver coming to pick me up. i asked my dad did you do something bad again daddy a he wa being handcuffed and he just smiled and replied daddy got into a little trouble (me thinking this wa normal back then because thing like this happened so often)

3562," 

so i met this woman last year in her late 20's while i'm in my early 30's; she's someone who's been through lot of trauma, ha trauma from her childhood and lot of emotional damage throughout her life... ptsd a well..

and just being real w/ you, but i come along and i'm a gentle-hearted, compassionate, selfless man and just really poured emotional support into her, and helped her financially a well during a very tough time in her life.

a couple month later, we went on a trip out west to stay at my parent winter getaway, and we had a wonderful time hiking, going on adventure etc.

she had never been on any vacation before, so she wa having the time of her life staying in some fancy private gated neighborhood, living like a queen and relaxing by the pool, going on adventures.

she also began giving me compliment on the trip, repeatedly saying ""you're so cute"", ""you're funny"" etc, and saying ""i like you"", and giving me these look of attraction, and just appreciating how i treat her.

once we returned home from the trip, i drove her home and we hung out, and she told me, ""you're the best thing to happen to me since forever, so much emotional support"".

yet, a few day later she said that on the trip ""we were relationship-like and that make me uncomfortable, because i'm not ready for a relationship right now.""

a few week later, she told me that ""i don't feel like i deserve you. we come from entirely different backgrounds.""

nobody ha ever given her the emotional/financial support that i have, and cared for her the way i do. and i also, by my very nature, live a virtuous life; i strive for growth, humility, and challenging myself to be better.

she is someone who ha said that change and growth ""makes me uncomfortable"", and that she ha very low self esteem, feel worthless, and definitely doe not like being vulnerable. she's been through some extreme emotional abuse in recent year before i met her, so she ha said she's emotionally unavailable and doesn't want a relationship with anyone right now.

that wa many month ago earlier this year, and we still get along well.

to me, it feel like she's running from the very person who is someone she's always wanted. a man who can provide for her financially and make her life so easy, and who also provides full emotional support and care... where she can be fully vulnerable and i'll take care of her, validate her and encourage her. she's never met someone like me before.

get this: the first day we ever hung out, she told mer her favorite movie involves a girl coming from a broken home that's poor financially, and meeting a gentle, kind, wealthier man who love her and care for her... she reject him romantically, because she feel he deserves better than someone like her.. and it take some time, but she ultimately realizes she doe love him and go back to him :)

i'm worried sick that she's going to sue me for medical expense and i'm going to lose everything i have, all the saving i'd worked for. i came from poverty and put so much effort into building myself up, and i can't bear to think of losing it all over such a negligible act on my part. i can't relax, and i don't know how i'll relax until the statute of limitation is up (6 months).

i always wanted to do something good with my life, but being courageous and making decision have always been hard for me. but, i don't think i'm that bad in sense that i can cope with my anxiety, and i think i'd overcome myself, but, maybe it would be easier and not that scary to start living and making my life together with medication?

i've always been fearful person, i think that's something i inherited from my mom- and my mom from grandmother, who ha panic disorder, so fear ha been in my family very much and growing up with anxious mom can definitely influence you in a big way. 

there, even medication is considered a shameful - specially mom is against it. but i think that actual fear from everything is worse than taking medication and accept help, although i'm not sure about it either, that's why i'm writing here.

i'm searching and thinking about buspiron, i've heard that it's not that strong medication and it also safe. so maybe ideal for me. but, i don't want to think about it a some magical pill, but who knows? many people said that it could be game changer for some.

will it help me conquer my fears? i want to live so much, i can see like having anxiety disorder can isolate you from everything, i see it in my family and i want to live different, full life. altough i don't know if need it. i think im in ""passive state"" of living for too long, which people with anxiety can relate to, i don't know what's on the other side, that's why i want to help myself with it. i don't want to live in a fear..

these are anxiety symptom i experience: shortness of breath, tingling and numbness in my entire body, worrying and overthinking about future. mainly that. and i know it could everything improve if i'd overcome myself.. but, it's just too overwhelming sometimes.

lifelong anxiety sufferer since i wa about 7ish.. started when i got jumpscared on a maze game-like website. i still wa able to function with struggle until about 2018 (age 21)when it all became unbearable. in 2013 (age 15ish) i got assaulted for my phone which left me with permanent depersonalization/derealization. these last 5 year have been filled with overwhelming physical discomfort such a fatigue, headaches, chest pains, super high heart rate for no reason (up to 175bpm when just walking or showering), and health anxiety even if ive gotten checked more than necessary. 

everybody urge me to just give into taking anti anxiety med but i am afraid of giving up a i admire and highly believe in natural healing through meditation and trauma healing and supplement and ect. i have been trying for five year to do thing that way but i havent been able to stay consistent due to my inconsistency and lack of motivation (also may be depressed).

i took an ssri for two day once in 2018 and couldnt handle the side effect and since then have not wanted to be on med due to fear of trial and error, dependence and withdrawal. 

i cant even fix myself up a meal. i cant even clean my own room without having extreme physical exhaust. even showering ha become unpredictable because sometimes my heart shoot up go 170ish bpm and it make me extremely exhausted for the rest of the day. 

growing up i just dealt with minor bullying, minor parental emotional negligence and getting hit with a belt side from dad side and paranoid overparenting on mom side and witnessing them argue (but not physically abuse eachother) on both parent side. family wa never really emotionally intelligent and ive taught myself how to be that way now.

can i still do this without meds? after nearly 20 year of anxiety, is it possible to heal without ssri or beta blockers? i dont want to be on med but im nearing my limit.. i dont want to be out of my son life any longer, and i dont want to depend on mom for the simplest thing such a toasting my breakfast in the morning or washing my clothes due to my physical exhaust. ive had treadmill test and blood work done and nothing show anything. im sure it anxiety.",anxiety

3590,"yesterday i wa sitting at my unis library and waiting for my next class. i generally like uni and had no problem with anyone or anything there. the day ha been a bit stressful, but at the moment i wa just sitting there not thinking of anything in particular. i wa absentmindedly scrolling through twitter and eating a sandwich when all of a sudden i wa filled with strange terror. i looked at the remaining sandwich and couldnt bear to take another bite a it looked nauseating to me now. i packed it up and sat there, confused. my heart wa pounding, my chest/neck felt tight, i felt slightly nauseated, later lightheaded, and i felt so fearful and dreadful with no thought or trigger. i strongly wanted to go home. 

i tried using the bathroom twice, praying, doing the 5 thing i can see count, breathing, focusing on a spot, texting people i trusted, but nothing helped. i went to class and just sat there trying to calm myself down. i kept worrying i would throw up, even though i knew it wa impossible because i wa physically fine. i did feel the attack ebb when i talked to people or at a moment when everybody laughed, but it came back right after. 

i wa trying to take the underground to work after, which i have done on a regular basis for years. but this wa the first time i wa on there and felt so constrained and terrified of being so far underground. i had to exit the current train i wa on because my classmate wa on there a well and had to wait for the next one. i just tried to focus on the thought of being at work (another environment i generally enjoy). the attack finally ended once i left the train and wa going up to the surface. walking in the cold, fresh air definitely helped. 

on my dinner break, i felt anxiety rapping up again slightly, but a strong voice in my head saying youre fine, stop this, it happened already and nothing happened! youre being ridiculous! and it went away soon after. the attack ebbed and flowed from a 6-9 level for about two hours. i do have some external unrelated stressors, but have no idea what triggered it and now im terrified itll happen again.",anxiety

3601,"\*using a throwaway because it's quite a sensitive topic that i don't want on my main

last week i started feeling strain near my groin area so i went to the doctor. they ran visual tests, urine tests, and ultrasound and didn't find anything serious, said that it is most likely due to muscle strain. he gave me medication for pain and inflammation, and while my condition have improved and the test show that i have nothing to worry about **i am still fucking anxious**.

the condition improved, but i still notice a dull ache from time to time. and whenever i think about it, i feel it even more. now i'm too paranoid to do anything because while trying to figure out my problem, i learnt about testicular torsion and apparently it's quite severe. even though it can be treated if moved quickly, i'm now in perpetual fear because apparently it can happen whenever, wherever, it's like living with a knife constantly held in my back. and because i still feel dull ache sometimes, my body squint at the fear of it possibly being testicular torsion even though it's not. i'm also now obsessed and anxious with how my d\*\*\* look because now i have fear to keep checking it whenever i feel any ache down there to make sure it's fine and in the right position and then i get anxious even more because i'm afraid i'm gonna accidentally fuck it up and give myself a torsion.

honestly i'm even thinking about seeing a chiropractor to confirm that it's muscle strain because even if the urologist told me that my testicle are fine, i need to know it's muscle strain and how to avoid it so i will be able to sleep at night. it's been 1 fucking week and i haven't been able to properly sleep with a peace of mind. during the day i get anxious thinking about how my condition will worsen and when a minor dull ache is felt i immediately thought i wa about to be rush to the er.

i don't know what to do. i'm waiting in line trying to see a therapist because this is fucking torture, but it'll most likely be next week. but i can't wait anymore. my body ache and i'm collapsing under pressure. i start feeling faint whenever i think about sleeping. i'm too afraid to go to sleep and i can't wait 2 day for it anymore",anxiety
3602,"looking back i have traversed three major deaths/separations in my life, and each time i found myself craving a new job, new living space, etc. i have always considered it a way to give myself a chance to move on from the loss (by inviting new social relationship at work, learning a new job, getting to experience a new living space), but more and more looking back these change have always been impulsive and required a significant recovery period after they are made in term of either emotion or finances.

someone close to me said last night that i am always pushing for change after a big unexpected, uncontrollable change occurs in my life to have some sense of control and to keep the moment going so to speak, said something along the line of the fact that i'm not comfortable resting and really just coming to term with what's comfortable and what's not with what i already have/where i'm already at. i can't disagree, but i can't fend off the overhead sense of ""the grass will be greener once i get x/y/z done"" either. 

i wa recently informally diagnosed with adhd by my therapist and will be looking into whether or not pmdd is a thing i deal with after noticing some cyclical fluctuation this year. but i wa just wondering if anyone else ha noticed this about themselves and if so if they have been able to overcome impulsive urge to change major life factor and found an alternative solution for this feeling. nobody like to realize that they're the weird one but more and more when i talk about looking for a new place to move to again people are like ""again? already?"" and it make me feel like i'm being crazy. it just make sense to me. i'm almost a year and a half into my lease and where i live doesn't make sense for my job anymore, doesn't make sense socially, financially, etc. but i have always been able to reason myself into that thinking, and i fear it will never stop.

im at my wit end with the hmrc and wanted to check in about this, a im sure somethings gone tit up; is it ok to ask here? or if not doe anyone have any tip about getting ahold of them? a dealing with them via the phone is always unpleseant :(

i work a full time job and do contracting on the side; and  whats confused me is that this is the second year in a row where my tax bill ha had a pretty massive balance payment, leading to an effective \*90%\* tax rate on my contracting. which seems, a bit fucked.

\- 2019-2020 my earnings were way higher than my previous year (thanks to starting a new job in addition to contracting), so my tax bill had a big balance payment on top of it;  leading to paying 20k in tax on 30k contracting income, and 28k from my job.

\- 2020-2021 my job earnings went up a bit whilst my self employment went down, with 35k income from my job, but 25k self employment. however this year the hmrc is asking for 13k tax from the self employment and a 10k balance payment on top.

super confused a i thought balance payment were a you were paying the last year tax forward if you underpaid, however in total i made about the same between both years.

would really appreciate any help a yeah, even though i make an ok income vet and heating bill are piling up; and whilst im fine with my tax going to help the country; i would much rather not buy rishi his fourth yaucht.

i have a bad back that requires regular treatment from my chiropractor. i had a runny nose and jokingly said i'm glad fluid is coming out one end and not the other, to which she replied ""oh haha, i've run out of finger and toe for the number of time i've made a patient shit themselves"". i asked her if she wa for real and she wa dead set serious. 

since then i've been worried about being the next one to shit themselves. i couldn't return to the same clinic and i'll be placed on the poop list for sure. what if they share the poop list with other clinics? and clinic interstate or even internationally? i need regular chiropractic treatment and honestly what she said terrifies me. that's why i think butt plug are a good way to prevent shitting yourself but i'm not sure if that's what they're even used for. i thought they were training tool for people to widen their buttholes. i really don't want to stick anything up my butt however i'll have this irrational fear of shitting myself every time i go to the chiropractor now.

3639,"...and i'm so damn mad at myself. my moment of clarity are fleeting now. i just feel myself slipping away (mentally) into an abyss of nothingness. i'm trying to reach out but i'm so sick and tired of feeling needy all the time now. i want to call my boyfriend, but i know he's asleep...so are my parents. my stomach is just churning and i'm afraid my cry will wake my dad up even though he's on the other side of the house. i'm tired of cry all the time, i'm tired of fighting all the time, i'm tired of just existing.


i fell asleep earlier, but not even for an hour. i've tried meditation track for anxiety, they helped but only for a moment. i ate food, but i'm just regretting it now because i feel sick to my stomach. i don't start therapy for another 17 days. how the hell am i going to make it?


i promise i'm trying to take it one day at a time, but i'm afraid to be alone. i'm not going to hurt myself, but i'm scared to be inside my own head. the terrible, cruel thing it say to me...that i say out loud. they all make sense.


when my depression and anxiety get bad, it feel like i'm crawling across broken glass and hot coals. trying to find a way to get back up again. i did stand up...but it wasn't long before i landed on my face again. why do we have to suffer like this? i'm trying so hard to be okay, but my mind chuckles, saying, ""did you *really* think you were gonna be okay?""...i'm trying...


i know we all have bad days, but this is the worst stretch i've ever had in term of severity...if it last longer than six months, it'll be the longest, too. i just want to check out mentally for a while, is that possible? just for a couple of month or something. i'm exhausted. i forget to breathe sometimes. my mind is *everywhere*. i'm afraid to reach out to friend and family because i don't want to bother them. it's 4am...people need to sleep. i don't want to wake them. but that's when monster like to come out and play.


i'm so sick of the monsters. mine... yours... everyone's. why do we have to deal with thing like this? why are people just chosen at random like this? perfectly happy, healthy people are ripped apart mentally for no reason...just because our brain decided to take a different path? why? there's a reason for it, right? if there's no rhyme or reason to it, then doesn't that just make life meaningless? what's the point in over 264 million people (that's more than 3.5% of the world's population) suffering from this hell? why are we stuck inside our own personal hell?


my mind used to be a wonderful place. i used to be so creative. it wa like a beautiful forest full of flora and fawna just teeming with life...but there wa a terrible fire inside my mind...and now it's akin to badlands. dirt. rocks. crap. death. jagged edges. burning coals. no sign of life. just...


...silence...


i'm over this horrible feeling. i'd give anything to just make myself...and others...feel better again. i want so much for anxiety to never exist. for depression not to exist. bpd, anxiety, depression, ptsd, bipolar...all of the mental disorders, too many to name....to just disappear from all of us. i'd give anything for that. because we *all* deserve happiness. life's hard a it is...why do our brain just make it worse?


i'm sorry for posting...i just...i needed to. please believe me when i say, that even though i don't know you, i'm sorry. i'm so sorry for everything you're going through. i'm sorry for what you've been through, what you will go through. if you've been through something traumatic that's made you this way, i'm sorry. i'm sorry if someone hurt you and you'll never get the apology you need. i'm sorry if your brain decided to wake up one day and tell you, ""no, we're going to head down this path now. fuck the nice one. i'm going to make your life hell now."" i'm sorry if you need medication and can't get it or can't afford it. i'm sorry for any little thing that trigger you. i'm sorry for everything i'm not even able to mention. there's *far* too many thing to name....and i'm sorry for that a well.

i am a 31 year old female, married, i have beautiful  friend and family. i am just a regular girl, but i did something a a teenager that ha been crushing me with shame and guilt ever since i realised the gravity of what i did (which wa a couple of year after-in my late teens.) this event in my past ha consumed me for so long, i have spent year and year trying to understand why it happened, if there wa anything i need to do to fix it, and how i could possibly carry on with my life after doing such a thing. i have told my parent and my husband everything- they have been understanding and supportive of me but i still feel so much shame for my actions. growing up and in my teen i wa subject to emotional abuse and trauma, and i wa exposed to pornography around age 10. my parent never spoke about sex or consent, not that these thing in any way excuse what i did but it may a contributing factor. i wa a very immature teen and not sexually experienced, i always felt really uncomfortable about it. i remember my dad friend flashing me when i wa about 13/14 year old but i dont remember being sexually abused a a child. im just mentioning thing that i think may have contributed to the dumb choice i made but honestly nothing excuse it. 

when i wa 15 year old, i wa asked to babysit a family friend toddler who wa 2.5 at the time. i remember being curious (not sexually motivated- if that make sense) and briefly touching him inappropriately. i also remember sitting on the couch and exposing myself to him. the last thing i remember is thinking i could try touching his thing with my tongue to see what it felt like- i stopped and didnt actually do this. after that, we carried on with our day normally. i remember thinking back then that it wa a weird thing to do but i guess i just thought i wa just experimenting and i didnt hurt him and he wouldnt remember. i didnt truly realise the gravity of it, the harm i risked causing him, the impact it could have on him. i literally just thought it wa weird but of no consequence. when i wa about 18, i remembered what i had done while i wa studying and learning about abuse. i realised what i had done wa actually abuse and not just experimenting and i wa mortified. suddenly the gravity of what i had done that day hit me and honestly ive been feeling sick to my stomach every day about it since. i have been suicidal, i have done so much research trying to understand why i did what i did, why i didnt realise wtf i wa doing, etc. i am in no way attracted to child and never have been. i have never done anything like that since that day. i know i wa a teen then and im an adult now, but i cannot move past the disgust and shame i feel for myself and my past actions. i feel like all my friend and the rest of my family would hate me and think im disgusting if they knew what i did. i feel like i dont deserve anything good in the world. i want to have a baby but i feel like i dont deserve to bring a precious baby into the world. i have so many friend with gorgeous kid and i see them and feel so much pain in my heart that i could have harmed a child in that sick way when i wa 15. i know i didnt have sexual intent and it wa out of but it wa still feel so sick and disgusting. 
i dont know what im asking for, i guess opinion or perspectives. i am open to anything. i have no idea what else to do and feel so alone. it so hard to even write this and seek help because i dont feel like i deserve it. but i cant end my life either because that would just pas the pain onto my loved one and i cant do that to them. thank you for reading this, i really appreciate you.",anxiety

i also recently met someone (17) who life a few block away from me, we get along pretty well and we smoke together sometimes. we text a lot, too, and she help me with thing going on in my mind and i help with thing she ha issue with, etc. id say she is one of the only people im excited about lately other than my girlfriend. we have made it clear we purely friend with no sexual stuff or anything like that and she really genuinely appreciated that she had a friend who she just hang out with and isnt just there to fuck (she ha an issue with self esteem and she ha sex a lot and let guy use her because it make her feel pretty, it one of the thing im helping her with). anyway she doesnt respond for long period of time throughout the day and i always think she is annoyed with me or ignoring me or something. and she say she really is thankful for having me a a friend and us :) a lot but i cant help feeling like she doesnt really care and is playing me in some kind of way.

3667,"i visited a psychiatrist today for the first time (i live in tokyo) and specifically asked him to prescribe me something to quickly and effectively get rid of panic attack (i wa diagnosed with gad and panic disorder before i moved here). 

he prescribed me alprazolam .4mg 3 x day. i told him i didnt want to take it regularly every day because i know that dependency and addiction can creep up quickly. i only really needed it for panic inducing event like meetings, etc. 

his response wa addiction only occurs if you let it.  not sure how i feel about that.

all result were normal. the last time i went, it wa the 21st of november.

well, now i am dealing with constant neck and back pain. i have somehow convinced myself it is meningitis. the neck pain only seems to happen when i tilt my head to the right. i can also feel tension at the top of my spine on either side. i have no other symptom of anything. i do have regular panic attacks. the neck pain and back pain have lasted about 4 days.

3677,"i don't know where else to post this. so if there's a better subreddit, please let me know. i just want to know if this happens to anyone else, if there's a name for it or why it happens.

this is something that's been happening to me for a really long time. i tend to develop a very strong aversion to certain things, usually shows, to a ridiculous extent.

generally this happens when i think a show is made for the male gaze, ha unnecessary violence, portrays woman in a weird or gross way and sexualizes them to cater to men... stuff like that, you can probably imagine. it also happens with unnecessary sex scenes. just for the record, i don't necessarily think a show is inherently bad just for having any of these, and i don't think it grant the type of reaction that i get.

it can happen with anything, but it tends to be stronger when my bf like the thing. for example, my brain will decide i don't like a show before i have even watched it because i judge it in my head and create prejudice against it. then, everytime i see it around i feel a bit sick. if my bf try talking to me about it i get anxious. i'll try to avoid it but i also want to stop feeling this way, so i will try watching it to judge it properly (and because i think it'll work a some sort of ""exposure therapy"") and it make me feel so anxious that i get sick in my stomach and i can't keep watching. if the show prof to be what i expected it to be even just a little bit, i just can't accept it or change my mind or try to be open minded about it. i feel like until i find out why this happens i'm never gonna get over it.

i want it to stop because it make me feel immature and stupid plus it's really tiring to get anxious/sick everytime i see certain piece of medium around, it ruin my mood randomly and my reaction is too extreme and irrational. plus i'm aware that the piece of medium i feel this way about aren't even a bad a i think they are, and i know the trait that make me feel an aversion are just part of these show and not their entire defining trait. i know i'm missing out on good and entertaining medium because i can't bring myself to get over this issue. and it make me feel like an asshole whenever my boyfriend talk about something he like and my brain decides to hate it with such passion because it's hard to pretend it doesn't make me feel sick and i don't have a good reason to feel this way. i don't want to tell him i feel this way because when i do i feel so guilty. 

also a i've said this can happen with anything, not just with stuff my bf likes, so i know the issue isn't with what he like specifically. i have the theory that it's worse when he like it because i interpret him liking something i dislike a some sort of betrayal (i know it's irrational and dumb).",anxiety
3678,"hi, around two week ago, i had a pretty bad experience with a high dosage of thc. ive never really smoked anything in my life other than that. starting on the 27th ive been having extremely bad anxiety, dp/dr and something similar to panic attack but not quite. i feel like im constantly going insane and losing control and i think i kind of just messed up my life and overall future (im 17) and im going to be stuck with this forever. im planning on seeking a therapist + psychiatrist but im scared of med and potentially going into drug-induced psychosis from them (potentially ocd.)

3716,"like i don't know, for the longest time i just told myself that i wa the one causing all my problems, and that if i just thought hard enough they would all go away

luckily i don't believe that a much anymore, and have started going to therapy, but i think i'm starting to realize that my anxiety, a well a the almost complete isolation i put myself under ha probably been caused by a lot of the people and interaction i've had

so yeah, currently my philosophy on my own life is basically ""stay a far away from people a possible, it's better for you to be alone than risk possibly making someone uncomfortable by being around them"" and that ha basically been the way i've lived my life for like a year now, just almost completely alone

and by going to therapy and talking a little bit to people again, i've kind of started to realize that i've probably spent way too much time around people who just made my problem worse

i'm just kind of making this to write down what i think might have led to me feeling the way i do now, so it'll probably be pretty heavy and personal, so you've been warned

so, to start with what is probably the most major, a well a the most ""formative"" event that might have led to this, are two thing i did to my mom that have really affected me, both when they happened, but they might still now

so when i wa like 9 or so, my mom wa an alcoholic, and i can remember specifically one time that i'd found a place that she hid alcohol from our stepdad, so i found it and told him, and that led to a massive fight between them

and awhile after that, i did something worse, when i literally told a police officer that she didn't feed us, when the only thing she did wa fall asleep, and make dinner a little later than usual, and i think that led to her getting into actual trouble, so that still make me feel awful, even if it also led to her getting help it wa a horrible thing to do, especially since i barely see my mom anymore after she started to get help

beyond that, throughout middle school, my grandma regularly blew up at me and my brother about school performance, calling u stupid and occasionally locking u in our rooms, that went on for awhile until my dad put his foot down on it, and basically told me and my brother to just walk back home if that ever happened again at her house, but since then it hasn't happened again

so that's the most egregious thing that have happened, but also there have been thing with friend that might have had an affect 

so, most of my friend have had some kind of anger issues, and while it's almost never been directed at me, and i've almost always actually been the person they turned to to vent about it, hearing them talk about people they hated or just them blowing up about something made me afraid that that is just the way most people are, and the judgement they had for everyone is what they would have had for me if they hadn't known me

also the group of friend i'd had wa also always pretty dramatic, they'd regularly break apart over argument and then come back together, and that also just kind of increased the hostility of it all, especially when a lot of the people who were also calmer, and also who were my closer friend in the group either moved away or just joined other people 

another thing is that since i wa someone who a lot of people went to, i've also just let a lot of them down, the other day i cried when clearing out old contacts, because i just saw how many of them were message from people asking me to hang our or asking for help, that i just never responded to, and the fact that there were almost a dozen of them, a well a the final message of my old best friend being a birthday message that i never responded to, all that really just kind of got to me

there have also been a few people who i felt pretty close to that i realized afterwards were just very nice, and overly polite without actually liking me at all, so that also gave me a healthy dose of paranoia and skepticism going forward 

and finally, either because of all of this, or just because it is truly all in my head, i started to get distant from my group of friends, i wasn't really supportive of anyone anymore, and i became so afraid of offending anyone or doing anything wrong, i became very distant from the rest of them, and eventually, when i just stopped talking to them entirely nobody even tried to contact me, so that kind of seemed to validate all of my assumption on it

and recently, against my better judgment, i decided to start talking to somebody i barely knew, because the thought of being alone forever just became too much to handle, and once i started talking to them more, i realized that they seemed to have a much better life than i did, so that is what kind of led me to try seeking out therapy and actually change my life, since i realized that i wasn't actually normal like i thought i was, and my experience were probably not a normal either, and so, that's why i'm making this, to see if it actually hasn't been normal, or if it has, and the people i've been talking to have just been having idyllic life",anxiety

3754,"i recently started therapy and when i made the appointment the intake person also set up a psych appointment for me too. i waited around 2 month for this appointment which wa today. 

during the appointment, there were two psychiatrist and a resident in the room since this wa a practice associated with a medical school. 

once the appointment started i wa only with the resident at first, and i began to explain all the thing i have been dealing with and explained my background and family history. i told him about my past experience with ssri (one over ten year ago and more recently 2 year ago) and the side effect i had experienced. i explained that since both different medication gave me bad side effect within a day of taking them that i wa feeling pretty hesitant about trying another medication. 

during this initial conversation i felt a though he wa really listening to me and respecting my feelings. however once he left to get the doctor (one wa the new psychiatrist in training and the actual psychiatrist i wa there to see) and came back it felt very different. 

once the doctor came in, it wa clear she wa under the impression that i wanted to change medication even though i am not currently taking anything. i once again made it very clear that i wasnt sure if medication wa right for me. then she immediately suggested one of the two medication that i had a reaction to.

i felt really pressured at this point and kind of relented and said i wa willing to try medication, but once again i wasnt sure this wa the right one. then, they began to process a prescription to my pharmacy on the computer. 

i asked how long people normally take this medication and she indicated that it would be a year long thing. i said i wa concerned about that, a i dont think it is a long term solution and also because i wasnt sure i would still have insurance in the foreseeable future, and she completely disregarded me. i know insurance issue have nothing to do with her, but it wa an actual real concern to me. 

i wa very uncomfortable and nearly in tear at this point and kind of shut down. it felt extremely humiliating and a though they were not listening to me at all. i really dont know if i am overreacting or not but i just do not feel comfortable taking this medication. i am willing (though unsure) to take a daily medication for my anxiety, but her prescribing one that i already said i had issue wa just felt a though they were not respecting my choices.",anxiety

having an understanding of the thing that might be contributing to our tiredness can help u to be a little kinder to ourselves. our tiredness isnt a sign of weakness  it our body natural response to long-standing anxiety.

3811,"a few year ago, i had a pretty bad stomach virus. after that, for about a year and a half, i would have constant anxiety about eating in front of others with fear of suddenly vomiting or losing control of my bowel for no reason. it led me to stay away from any gathering where there may be food, even though it wa just close friend and extended family. however, for some reason, it went away and i've been enjoying a period with little to no anxiety around eating (or any social event) for about 2 years. the other day, while out with some friends, with no warning or apparent cause i went into a small anxiety attack. i felt like vomiting or losing control of my bowel - the same feeling i dealt with a couple year ago. however, this time, it involved everything; not just eating. quick ride with some friend to basketball? feeling like i'm gonna vomit in the car. hanging out for a couple hour to watch a movie? gonna vomit. and so on. this feeling came out of literally nowhere and now impact every social event, not just eating. i really don't wanna go back to this and i've been trying to do a much socially a a i can so it can just go away. the feeling can be described a if i'm not in reality, stomach is up in the air and ready to come out, or i'm gonna lose control of my bowel suddenly. the weird thing is, it's broken up by small period (which can last from second to a few minutes) where i am completely fine and conscious of how i am feeling.  then it'll go straight back to that panic. what can i do to stop this? why would this even come out of nowhere in the first place? thanks for listening.",anxiety

i am autistic (sometimes i wonder adhd too) and i am very bad at conversations. i am expected to teach the class tomorrow about my topic. they get to ask me question and i'm supposed to make it flow. maybe if it wa a topic i wa passionate about but we had to choose boring stuff. i have a tendency to freeze up and go non-verbal (autism related, not anxiety). my brain ha to pause for a minute to process thing and sometimes i literally cannot speak. even if i'm very well prepared for something, sometimes i still need a minute to process.

this is where the anxiety kick in. it's absolutely terrifying to know there's a 95% chance your brain is going to pause for *at least* 30 second while you're trying to figure out how to respond. imagine doing that, in front of a class, and you're getting graded on it. the awkward silence. and then i would freeze from anxiety and overwhelming myself so i don't cry.

also this is worth like 45% of my grade, and probably technically more than that. if i fuck up and the teacher think i'm unprepared and didn't try hard enough this could literally make or break me... i could fail because of this. because this is the only assignment we've had all semester, save for a few others. but because he hasn't assigned/graded much work this is worth *a lot* of my grade.

i'm trying to prepare myself a best a possible but every time i try to practice i freak out and breakdown into tears. i watched everyone else present and they made their conversation flow so well. they're all so charismatic. i wish i wasn't autistic.

and that's neverminding all the other stuff that's making thing even worse. i'm so tempted to not even show up tomorrow. i feel like i'd rather fail. i've given myself anxiety so bad it sent me into a month-long issue of throwing up after meals, even when i wasn't feeling anxious in that exact moment.",anxiety
3816,"i'm in my late 30 and i feel like i've developed a real issue in the last 2-3 years.

seemingly out of nowhere, i have travel anxiety. i used to have flight anxiety that wa more traditional: the plane hit turbulence, i panic a little with ""is this plane going to go down??"" but on a smooth flight i would often fall asleep, and never ever had any problem at my destination. in fact, i enjoyed travel other than the mixed feeling about bumpier flights. hotels, expense accounts, rental cars... it wa fun!

somewhere along the line, that changed. and i think i know when.

**background 1**

a silly, stupid thing happened in spring 2021. i invented a party game. i wa under no delusion that it wa the next apple to apples, it wa just a fun hobby to take up during covid. i rolled it out to my wife's family during a vacation trip and they loved it. sure there were some area to tweak - question could be harder, scoring could be le complicated - but they really liked the game and we had a blast playing.

a couple month later it wa my side of the family's turn to go on vacation and my mom insisted i bring the game. the experience could not have gone differently. my oldest brother started ""jokingly"" mocking the rule a i wa explaining them. my middle brother wa a zombie the entire time, going with the flow not really wanting to be there. and my mom hated it because it's trivia based and she got her 2 question wrong before she quit. they didn't even play through one full round before calling it quits and i found myself standing there getting peppered with question and unsolicited way to improve it without anyone saying anything slightly positive. eventually my dad and sister-in-law, who must have higher emotional iq, started hedging some comment ""i really think it's a good foundation! there's a lot to go on here!"" my wife had already left the room. she told me in our bedroom later that she left because she could not believe how they were all dumping on me and if she didn't leave she would have said something she'd regret. in the moment, i brushed it all off. ""oh well, they didn't like it, it's no big deal.""

that night, around 1:30am i jolted awake. suddenly i felt very aware of the fact we had crammed 8 adult and 6 kid into a small 1500 sqft 5 bedroom house. i started pacing our small bedroom feeling like i couldn't get air, feeling like i wa trapped here, hour from the airport and 5 day from my return flight. i think this wa my first ever panic attack.

thankfully, i had my wife there and some xanex the doctor gave me for flight anxiety. my wife and i went into the more open living room and talked for an hour until i felt better, debriefing the entire game situation and her being totally supportive even if i wanted to spend several hundred dollar to change our flight to leave the next day. in the end i decided not to cause any wave doing that, and we decided to just ""escape"" the house during the day, heading out all day to do our own thing, and returning for dinner.

**background 2**

approx. 11 month later, this past april, covid travel restriction lifted for my company and i flew to canada for work for 3 nights. i had never traveled internationally before and wa initially excited. however on my last night, i got ""food poisoning"" eating some street food. i jolted awake two hour after eating getting sick in multiple ways. i put food poisoning in quote because looking back, i now think it wasn't food poisoning, but anxiety. after getting sick a couple of times, i finally got to sleep, and wa totally fine the next day in the office. my flight out wa at midnight and at the airport i found myself feeling sick again, to the point i wa forcing myself to throw up in an airport bathroom, and physically shaking a i waited to board the plane, wondering if i'd get sick on the plane. a soon a i boarded, like a curtain lifting, i wa totally fine for the rest of the flight. even slept a little. it took my primary doctor raising an eyebrow for me to realize i probably didn't have any food poisoning, but rather most likely had anxiety. 

i had to go back to the same place in canada 5 month later and that trip went much better, although i did feel a ""pang"" of anxiety at night again. my wife had me download the calm app and i wa surprised that a quick 5-minute breathing exercise actually helped ease my symptoms.

**today**

i have accepted a new job that is a big step for my career: large raise, big promotion. the ""downside,"" which almost led me to decline the officer, is that they are headquartered in europe and my team will travel to hq a couple times/year. i have no idea what i'll do on a 10 hour flight when anxiety won't let me sleep. i have no idea what i'll do if i start to panic in cold, dark, overcast northern europe so much father from home than canada when i could barely make it through that trip. i woke up at 6am today already feeling like my stomach wa upset and anxious about it, when the trip is 7 week away.

meanwhile, my wife ha been asking me when we will be able to go to europe on our own vacation, and i have simply said i'm not sure. she is making plan to go by herself if necessary, she ha set a deadline of this spring. if she doe go by herself, i'll fear for her safety and she'll be extremely disappointed that i'm not with her. i would have been excited about this trip 3 year ago, now i view it a ""would i be able to make it?"" certainly, her being with me is better for me than my traveling solo.

and the longer this travel-related anxiety go on, the more it feel like this is settling in a a permanent part of me rather than a phase i had hoped to overcome. i wasn't like this 2-3 year ago, after all. i've tried several session of talk therapy but feel like it hasn't made a distinguishable impact, the main takeaway wa that i need to keep forcing myself to travel for exposure. my wife's suggestion is that i need to find a therapist not on one of those talkspace websites... but no idea where else to turn. i'm also very reluctant to start medication given all of the possible side effects.

i think the theme of my issue is ""control."" for example, i'm no longer afraid of flying because of crashing, i dislike it because i know i'm trapped on the plane and more or le stuck in my seat for 10 hours. i don't like travel because if something go wrong, i can't magically go home to my safe/comfortable environment. slightly easier if i've driven to my destination and know i can leave whenever if need be.

edit: my medical student friend told me it wasn't my responsibility to check her bp and all. and he said that maybe when she ha headache or dizziness i can check cu that is sign of hypertensive crisis which can also be life threatening. however, i didn't bother telling her that if she had a headache or something to tell me to check. i just didn't give a shit for like the entire weekend and then on monday when i wa leaving for uni, i saw her in the morning and i got this thought, ""if i don't tell her and if we miss the sign she can die"". but it felt very weird to tell her right in the morning when she had just gotten up to pee and go back to bed. but i felt really guilty so i told my mom that if she complains about it, it could mean that her bp is very high. now i gave my mom this information but i kept it away from my grandmother for like an entire weekend despite knowing it could kill her if she didn't know. and with all my biased against her, i feel like this is attempted murder. what do you think? help me.",anxiety

i'm 24 (25 next month), i go to college during the day and work overnight, and i've always had pretty bad anxiety. i've been on a few different medication (lexapro, paxil, and effexor), but this month will make a year since being on effexor. i wa able to come off said medication primarily because at the time i'd saved up enough money to take nearly a year break from working to focus on myself and school. however, since returning to work in may (fast food), i've slowly felt my anxiety creeping back in. some of these anxious belief were founded in reality; mainly, i faced some discrimination and harassment at my first job location, so i transferred to a new location across town, had a similar issue, decided to quite the job completely, and start something outside of fast food. i now work a an overnight stocker at a retail store, and while the pressure of dealing with customer is now nonexistent, the employee still feel like an obstacle. 

to be specific, this past week, i wa assigned to work an area alone i'd never worked before (today will make a month there, so i'm still pretty new). in this type of situation, i generally am not anxious because i trust my work ethic enough to know that while i'm still new and unfamiliar, i can work quickly and accurately enough to be up for the challenge. however, around 3am when i return from lunch, i'm starting my second to last pallet when another regular employee (she's close with both the overnight coach and a team lead) come to deliver a message. she start by asking me how much i have left, and i respond by telling her that i have one more pallet after this one. she then says, ""okay,' wait a beat, and then says, ""he need you need to be done."" i assume by ""he"" that she's referring to the coach but am confused by how vague she's being and why she's telling me this. i wanted to press further, but i don't like to show my anxiousness, so i remain casual and say, ""done? like right now?"" she says, ""by 7, when your shift ends, you need to be cleaned up and finished with these pallets."" i'm confused again because there would be no reason to tell me this unless i normally am not finished by 7, but there's only been one night in the past month that i've not been finished by 7. at this point, i couldn't hide how confused and anxious i wa by this ambiguity of this situation. so i hesitantly respond by saying, ""okay. . . "" she then says, ""he's testing you,"" again referring to the overnight coach. i say, ""a test? what doe that mean?"" she responds, ""it's a good test,"" and then seemingly in attempt to reassure me go on to explain that the employee normally in my area generally take all night to stock the area even with another employee helping, and the overnight coach want to prove a point that one employee can do it alone. based on the tone of the conversation and what she'd said before, i have a hard time believing this but accept her explanation and move on with finishing the pallets. this wouldn't be the first time i've felt such ambiguity at this workplace regarding me, but this wa definitely the most explicit manifestation of it. 

i finished the pallet by 6, had enough time to clean up, and while i'm in the backroom dropping off a few things, i pas the employee who'd spoken to me earlier who says, ""great job today, you did so well. make sure they tell you that you did well,"" and despite her tone of voice being rather neutral, her facial expression look oddly happy or elated. i thank her and for a moment continue what i wa doing, but i couldn't help but politely confront her about the situation earlier. i approach her and say, ""was that really about the other associate being slow or wa it about me?"" she says, ""no, you did great, i've only heard good thing about you."" i say, ""are you sure?"" she repeats, ""yes, only good things."" i end the conversation, finish what i wa doing, and return to zone my area. 

there were plenty of other thing that occurred in that night, but i can't be sure if they were just me being anxious or if they were real. however, i can't help but be incredibly nervous and apprehensive about this environment now and how these employee feel about me. i'm also confused because i know a few other new employee who objectively have worse work ethic (showing up to work late, clocking out early, putting thing on overstock when they could go on the shelves, not working efficiently) but from what i'm aware of, these employee aren't spoken to in this vague manner and aren't given the same workload. i've even asked the team lead here and there about my performance, and they always say that i'm doing fine. am i just in my head? i have an appointment january 3rd with my general practitioner, and i certainly don't want to get back on my medicine if i'm not just being anxious, but if i am, this is reason enough to do so. please let me know your thoughts, i really would like many outside, honest opinions.

 if for some reason this isn't the right community, i'd appreciate referral to other places.",anxiety

3844,"i'm no stranger to anxiety, and in particular, hypochondria ha been a recurring theme in my life. my last bad flare wa around 8 year ago after the sudden death of my father. i wa visiting several walk-in clinic per day, convinced that i wa dying of cancer and needed all kind of tests.   


now after getting a pretty bad cold that took a couple week to recover from, i'm experiencing a very strange symptom of body buzzing/vibrating/zapping when i move my neck and lower back in a certain way. i also had a few day of a pretty bad headache that won't go away. of course m come up when i search, in big scary letters. all the press about selma blair and christina applegate recently doesn't help (i love both of them, though). and i am exactly in the right age/risk group for ms. i'm afraid to visit the doctor because i don't want to get a bunch of painful test for no reason, and of course i'm scared that there will actually be a diagnosis this time. i also don't want to do anything that will trigger/feed the anxiety monster even more. i think i lost my health card and have purposely not gotten a replacement because i don't want to tempt myself. i'm already on a wait list for therapy, but this will likely take a few months.   


i also know how much anxiety can manifest physically, and i am questioning if what i am feeling is even real or just the anxiety.. i am really worried i am going towards the really bad place again, and i'm not sure what is the right way to go to pull myself out. i know that nothing can replace a visit to a doctor or therapist, but some helpful word and advice would be really appericiated here.",anxiety

so am i a ""normal"" person now ? no i am not, i still do get anxiety, sadness and fear but atleast i am able to not he paralysed by it. infact i am extremely scared of sharing this story a i feel down inside my demon still tempt me by saying that i could ruin all my progress if i open up of what are achivements regardless of if i think if it's an achievement or not. maybe this along with a constant attempt of trying not to unintentionally outshine sucess story ha made me scared of accepting what all i have done right. i am a different person because no one who go through hell and come back should be expected to be a past version of himself. normal is overrated, be yourself.

there is this beautiful concept in hinduism of the idea of the shiva, the god of destruction and a god that ha gone through a lot of personal struggle and strife, also being the god of the sage and suprising the master of art and in a way a master of creativity. a per my understanding i interpret this that almost paradoxical the destruction of the ego or the person you think you should be is the creation of the person you should be. that's enough philosophy tbh at the current moment.

i am a procrastinator and i am sure many of anxious people are. i procrastinate on everything, postponing the tasks, waiting for deadline and etc.

yes, it's a bad habit, just like having an anxiety, let's say. so why don't we let them cancel each other out.

everytime i start overthinking about a certain topic, thinking of hundrends of different scenarios, what will i say if this happens, and what do i do in that case, and what will that cause after and bla bla bla, i just say to myself:

""i'll worry about this tomorrow."" and move my attention to something else, something more relevant in that situation. 

mentally, while saying that, i imagine a separate bookshelf, frame in my mind, where i put this subject i wa overthinking about, put it away and procrastinate on it.

i started sertraline a long time ago (dont remember exactly when), but im now 21 year old and am supposed to be taking 200mg a day. recently ive been bad about being consistent- i havent taken 200 in a while. i wa slowly getting myself back on track taking 100mg a day, and i wa fine, but i fell ill recently (no idea what it is but it knocked me out) and because of that, i havent had an appetite. i have always sworn up and down that this med need to be taken with food. since i havent really been eating- i subconsciously stopped taking my medication again - and im feeling the effects. it been a week, and im finally at a point where i can eat enough to feel comfortable taking it. however, im afraid that restarting it, like taking 100mg tomorrow, will make me face insane side effect (nausea is the one im worried about). 

this medication ha never given me bad nausea before, some lbm and sweat for sure, but it never made me throw up. i know this logically. however. i am terrified of restarting it after a week because what if this time it doe make you sick and you throw up? 

im not looking for anyone to say throwing up isnt that bad, get over it - my health anxiety and emetaphobia will argue with you all day long and i dont have the energy. im just looking for an answer to my worries, and if theyre valid or not (i hope theyre not and everyone is like nooo if you dont get side effect before youll be fine! but i want people to be honest too. )

3921,"so ive suffered with anxiety for year now. but ive always managed to just kinda move on and live a semi-normal life. i actually came off sertraline about a year ago because i started to feel much better and felt i no longer needed them.

then rewind a month and i wa racing down to the hospital at 5am to be with my mum who wa in the resuscitation unit of the a&amp;e. she wa unconscious and we were told she needed to head for emergency surgery within hour or she would die. but also that there wa a risk the surgery itself could kill her. so we were left with no choice but to tell them they need to do their best to try and save her life. family came down and we all sat in the hospital cafe for hour waiting to hear how it went. finally that phone call came and she had survived. she wa placed into icu and on a ventilator. she wa in for 11 day and she did amazing. her wound were healing well and she wa coherent. everything went a well a it could. we were absolutely blessed. i wa not ready to lose my mum being only 27. im not sure what i could possibly do without her. shes home now and recovering well.

this is where i move onto my own issues. since this all happened ive developed my own issue that i believe are related to the trauma of what happened. so the first thing that happened wa i started having ectopic heart beat (pvcs). id never experienced this before. i didnt know what they were so i kinda just ignored it. then one night i wa lay in bed and got a series of them. this caused my body to go into a massive panic attack. heart rate over 160, shaking, more ectopic beats. i woke my sister up and got her to rush me to a&amp;e because i thought i wa experiencing something deadly serious. i lost control of my hand and face on the car. walked into a&amp;e, told them everything. sat down and managed to calm myself down. come to have an ecg and it come back fine. wait in a&amp;e overnight a it wa a 7 hour wait to see a doctor. have another ecg thats once again fine. doctor say to get a holter monitor and a thyroid blood test. still waiting on the holter results. thyroid came back fine.

fast forward to now, my health anxiety ha completely taken over my life. whenever my heart rate get high i start getting the ectopic beats. so ive been avoiding any and all exertion where possible. i still do what i have to like cooking or cleaning. that wa until a few day ago. i wa stood in the kitchen cooking myself some food, when all of a sudden i felt incredibly dizzy and sick. heart beating out of my chest. i tried to sit down and do some breathing exercises. they didnt really help at all. i ended up calling 111 and they once again suggested i go to a&amp;e. so i did. i wa there 14 hours. checked over and everything fine once again. sent home with the all clear.

im starting to think all these symptom are being caused by the stress and anxiety of almost losing my mum and how traumatic it wa to experience. but until i get answer or see improvement my brain just go into a doomsday loop of worrying about death constantly. i also have another health issue where i have migraine and swollen lymph node and pain when swallowing. this is being looked into by ent but it taking a long time. so not having any answer in regard to that is causing me a lot of anxiety a well. then there the awful chest pain and chest and throat tightness that i also know can be caused by anxiety a well.

i suppose the purpose of this post wa to vent and get this off my chest, but also to ask if anyone else ha found that their anxiety cause them extreme physical symptom thats make you think the worst case scenario is what will happen and you get trapped into a doomsday loop of worrying.

3935,"hello all,

im pretty new to reddit so sorry if im using this incorrectly done but i have been reading and responding to this thread for a couple month now.

i think writing my feeling right now on here will help me some how, so ignore if you are uninterested in a bit of a spill. 

i have had ocd my whole life, which for the most part ha been under control (i go through bad spell here and there). i also have anxiety disorder and panic disorder. i unfortunately have been having daily panic/anxiety attack and depersonalization since august, which i havent had since i wa 16 (24 now) and they werent this bad. i am always dealing with something mental health wise, but i can definitely say that this is the worst it ever been. it ha been extremely crippling. sometimes i feel like im dying, sometimes i feel out of body and that i am going to go insane and it hard to see the light at the end of the tunnel.

i have been very successful in my career so far. my passion is helping the planet, and i landed myself in a career raising private equity fund and investing in clean energy projects. i can work towards a sustainable future while making a good career for myself. next year i will make over 6 figures. i grew up poor, so this is an absolute dream come true to me. no one in my extended family ha ever made this much at my age. and i get to do what i love. everything in my life is going well, my job, my family, etc. 

my one problem is my mental health. i have been working to get a psychologist/psychiatrist for a couple week now, but thing move slow so it hasnt happened yet. mental health problem run in my family (ocd, panic disorder, etc), so at least i have that comfort, but it doesnt make it that much easier. i had a doctor check me to prove to myself that im physically healthy with an ekg and a blood test. he said my blood work and heart test show that i am very healthy.

tomorrow i have an in-person business meeting at a breakfast spot. i am so afraid that i will get a panic attack while it happens. 

wish me luck please. i know i can make it. 

maybe my friend on this sub can give me some encouraging word to make it that much easier though. love you all.",anxiety

3953,"hi everyone, i hope you're having a chill day.

i'm currently awake at 3 am, and i thought to ask whether anyone else is being kept at night by this somewhat bizarre fear/thought loop.

sometimes when i'm about to go to bed, i get overwhelmed by this idea of losing continuity a a person. if i lose conciousness for a period and then ""restart"" in the morning, is that person waking up the same a the one that went to sleep? or is it someone new, just carrying that baggage of memory through the day and dying in the evening to make room for the next one. this may sound too philosophical to induce anxiety, but there's a sense of impending doom to it that scream ""don't fall asleep, sleep is death"". to be honest, i find it hard to convey the terror of this scenario to the people i talk to, which is why i decided to ask here. maybe someone ha thought of this, or maybe this kind of fear ha a name. or maybe y'all have different, but similarily abstract sleep related fears? feel free to share",anxiety
3954,"i guess i'm just looking to vent over my past couple of week of my struggle with anxiety.  maybe i'm looking to confirm i'm not alone or some reassurance that it will get better.

back story: i've always had some generalized anxiety throughout my life but i've always been able to keep it under control. save two times. once in my early 20 and the other started about two week ago.  i got covid about a month and a half ago, got through it okay and wa feeling great for a couple of week afterwards.  flash forward to 2 week ago, it started with insomnia for a couple of day over the weekend and from there it's spiralled out of control.  it came out of nowhere and the only explanation i've been able to come up with wa it wa a symptom of long covid since apparently insomnia and anxiety can surface up to a couple of month after.

i reached out to my doctor because of my anxiety and insomnia and he prescribed me 75 mg of trazodone.  after two day at the 75mg my anxiety wa extremely high and i decided to drop it down to 50mg.  that seemed to be doing the trick and last weekend i felt the most like myself than i had been for weeks.  sunday night i spiralled (possibly the thought of work the next day), and decided to try 75mg again.  i've taken the 75 mg 3 night in a row now and my anxiety is breaking me, i'm at a loss and so exhausted/frustrated of this one-two punch of being extremely anxious and not sleeping well, i feel like i'm losing my mind. note, i don't have a lot of experience in medication so i'm having a hard time telling what's normal and what's not.

i've also got a small prescription for lorazepam, the prescription is to take 1mg a needed but only once every 3 days.  i've broken them into .5mg tablet so that i might be able to use them on consecutive days.

one of the thing i'm concerned about is the increase a it almost seems like it made it worse.  how much legitimacy do you all think is behind the worse before it get better statement. because it's really bad.  i'm almost thinking i should go back down to the 50 but i'm scared of that fucking thing up again.  i'm just not sure how much longer i can handle this.  i'm thinking of trying 50mg of trazodone and 10 mg melatonin to help me sleep tonight.

i'm so frustrated at my situation and i'm nearly at my wit end.  any advice or encouragement would be much appreciated.",anxiety
3955,"im super annoyed and nervous at the same time because i had been stressing out for two weeks! i finally calmed down because the doctor said that everything looked and sounded fine, but since i wa such a nervous wreck, hell set up an mri for me! i finally calm down after being in a constant state of panic and anxiety and the second i do, my right arm feel weak and tingly.. heavy and brain feel tired and dizzy when turning and looking around fast. i panicked again because i thought i wa having a stroke or a seizure but i look in the mirror, and im fine! i feel my arm and neck because i think maybe im having twitch or convulsions.. nope! so i started calming down and my brain gave me the middle finger and told me to panic again! and since im in a panicked and anxious state again, my vertigo is lasting! im starting to believe that maybe my brain just doesnt like want to relax or calm down anymore.",anxiety

3960,"hey everyone for background my gf ha had always had bad anxiety and recently her therapist ha prescribed her med for it and after looking up the side effect most of the medication apparently can make you lose your emotion and love for your partner? im not gonna bring up any of my worry and insecurity with my gf a i dont want her to second guess anything and i support her 100%. i know shes tried all the natural remedy in the book at this point so if being able to finally relive some of her anxiety requires her to fall out of love with me so be it. her health is very important to me and i hope these med help but i wa hoping to get some insight from people who have had experience with anxiety med and how it affected their relationship and outlook on love?
we have a very healthy relationship and consider each other our first true loves. we both have issue opening up to people and never really did in previous relationship due to our rougher childhood but instantly felt safe with each other. we are very close and i would hate for that to change. ive never been able to show emotion to anyone else cause of how my father wa growing up:/",anxiety
3961,[removed],anxiety
3962,"hello,

i'm struggled with mental health issue for a long a i can remember, recently a co-worker said i remind her of her son who ha adhd and i should look into it (not in an impolite way).

i started googling around and found a thread about people's symptoms. i thought i'd create a list of similar attribute to see what people thought? if possible let me know what you think, i know it's a bit long, so thank you for reading if you do!

something is going on with me, i'm not sure if it's depression, anxiety. i'm getting older now. i'd like to try to get some of this resolved if at all possible.

the good:

i've held a good steady job for a long time

i've held a fitness routine for a long time

i'm clean and tidy

i'm not impulsive, if anything i'm incredibly risk averse.

i'm patient and understanding

i've been in a relationship for a long time.

the bad

the number one thing is i've never had a purpose, never wanted anything. i've always felt lost and directionless. i don't chase anything. i just am. i can agree or disagree, but i cannot really fill a vision board if i tried. i could do things, or i could not, i wouldn't care either way.

ironically i don't know if i am indecisive, but i tell myself that i don't care either way

organization | terrible i think. i am not organized, but i'm tidy if that make sense? i don't really understand this. like if you open my drawers, it's spaghetti, but the top of the desk is clean?

rejection sensitivity, i interpret unspoken body language a rejection. this ha been a huge hurdle in my relationship a i'm constantly monitoring my partner body language for rejection. i voluntarily walk on egg shell so i don't ""do the wrong thing"".

i struggle with hearing people properly.

if i'm having a conversation and there's a loud noise, even though i can ""hear"" the conversation, the noise is all my brain interprets and the other person may a well be speaking a different language.

i struggle with difficult manual that are ""too hard""

i struggle with easy manual a they are ""too easy"" so i skim and miss important things. i often have to take apart thing i've built because i missed a key detail early on.

i make careless mistake in email and creative writing even when re-reading them.

only motivation for what i enjoy, and the pool is getting smaller a i get older.

i wa a smart child, but never applied. i took easy course so i would get good grades.

when i went to college i simply couldn't keep up/understand the workload. i wa easily frustrated and quick to give up. i wa bored in lectures. if i didn't just attempt to write what the professor spoke word for word, i wouldn't retain any information at all.

leaving college made me feel like a failure and i've felt like a failure ever since.

i will work out every day, but i won't build a meaningful progressive routine.

i thrive on routine and discipline and deviation cause me huge amount of stress.

i will clean up, but only set task that i know how to do. i won't branch out and start cleaning the shower, since i never do.

if cleaning the shower becomes a part of my routine or i am asked, i will then do it.

mentally my life is a big checksheet. i forget some things, but i cannot relax or even allow myself to rest until ""my checklists"" are done. no matter how tired.

i do thing according to checklist to keep me safe. to make sure i'm doing life ""right""

i make huge excel checklists, then procrastinate at anything that can't be completed instantly. i try breaking thing down into smaller chunks, then again, if there's anything that take a long time, i just push it further down until i have to do it.

i need exact instruction for thing at work. vague thing frustrate me.

i never hear people at first, then i say ""pardon"" then it turn out i did hear them. my brain needed to catch up

i will finish everyone's sentences. people tell me i talk very fast. i get incredibly frustrated with slow talkers.

when people talk to me, i don't always listen instead, i'm planning my response.

anxiety if plan change. i can't cope. unless someone is cancelling plans, in which case i'm relieved

i'm tired all the time. all the time. i wake up tired.

anxiety about hanging out with people i like.

if i wake up and i'm anxious in the night, i'll keep myself awake by imagining sliding door scenarios. i can do this for hours. in the morning it's all meaningless.

sometimes i dream about real life. like going to work etc... then i have trouble differentiating between thing i did in the dream and what's real. for example, i dream that sue need me to fix a document, so i'll walk over to sue and a i'm walking i'll realize she doesn't need help, it wa a dream. my dream are hyper realistic. if i have a bad dream, it affect my mood all day even though it wasn't real, i have a hard time emotionally separating.

huge focus on sex and sexuality and if i'm not getting it, i don't feel loved. i feel like a loser. when we do have it, i don't actually enjoy it. i'm constantly thinking ""am i touching this right, doing this right"". like a game i'm trying to get the most point at. it's hugely stressful for me.

constantly comparing my life to others, people i don't know and story i read. i often attempt to squeeze and compare online story to my life.

i don't feel like i have a personality, i just take bit and piece from what i see other people do that i like or that other people respond positively to. when i wa younger i attempted to be like my brother who wa just effortlessly cool. when i did the thing he did, they were awkward and cringey. other people can see this. i feel like i do the same thing he does, but they don't... work for me? like i could go to open the door for someone, but i push and it's a pull door, so i can't open it and i'm getting flustered and it wa clearly labelled, and then i think of that interaction constantly for the rest of my life.

i don't feel like an adult. i feel like a child pretending to be an adult and i'm just waiting for ""gotcha"" when everyone else figure it out. i feel like a fake at my job and i'm just waiting to be fired. ironically this doesn't motivate me to learn more, study or work harder.

i procrastinate so much on thing that i promise i'll do. i made a new year resolution that wa very quick and easy. i haven't done it all year.

i have trouble staying awake in face-to-face meetings. this is one of the hardest thing i have to do in my life. i can't emphasize this enough.

i can't focus on virtual meetings, i need to be doing something in the background. i'll turn off the camera and play on my phone then realize i needed to be paying attention, close the phone then repeat.

when i'm waiting for something on a pc, i'll swap to doing something else

i play multiple pc game at the same time to avoid game downtime load screen etc.

i have huge problem focusing in meetings. i often get caught out and have to ask people to repeat what we're talking about.

i have trouble staying awake driving home

i arrive at work not knowing how i got there, daydreaming

i daydream a lot a an escape. i retreat into fantasy where i have lot of money and don't have to work.

i'm very creative, i can make games, book and story in my head by just listening to music.

i find myself disassociating a lot. i will force myself back into my body with breathing and touch. i'm getting better at this, but it doesn't seem to change anything. i often feel like i'm floating with my body, like everything is cloudy. i get moment of clarity where i feel ""normal"" and they're wonderful, but rare.

i cannot study. i read, then rearead. it can take me many attempt to read and learn something. i will forget it very quickly regardless. i've read the same starter book over and over and each time the information feel new.

if i attend a training course for work, i will not remember a single thing within a few weeks.

i have in the past been able to read fiction books, when i remember them, it wa like i wa watching a movie. not for a very very long time now.

i have waiting anxiety. if there is something coming up that i have to do, i won't be able to do anything until that thing happens.

i don't call my loved one outside of my immediate family. i never call my brothers. i only call my dad out of guilt and i had to make a habit/time

i will miss meeting even though i set them in my calendar. i will dismiss, telling myself i'll remember it, it's only in 15 minute then start working on something and forget about the meeting.

someone will ask me to do something, i say i'll do it right away, then not do it and forget about it.

what do i do about it?

i take a mindfulness walk every day

i meditate ever second or third day

i workout, both strength training and cardio

i attempt to keep good sleep hygeine. same bed time every night, no screen directly before bed.

i limit/avoid caffeine where possible (decaf drinks)

i eat a very rigid healthy diet.

i try to keep a mood journal

i practice gratitude constantly.

i practice diaphragmatic breathing.

i've been to a few doctors, i've asked for a mental health plan, i go and talk to a psychologist and they just seem so.. unhelpful, they always start with the same thing like mindfulness and breathing.. i just can't get past the barrier where i feel they understand what i'm talking about

one gp prescribed me with anti-anxiety medication. i'm reluctant to take medication a i am functioning, i'm just a mess internally.

so, i'm not sure where to go, i don't think my area is a good resource for mental health. doe this sound like adhd? anxiety? depression? halp!",anxiety
3963,"a month ago at the pharmacy one pharmacist 'complimented' my hairs, saying it wa ""nice that you cut them a we can see your face now"". it might sound like nothing but this wa literally the first time a stranger spoke nicely to me like that in years, and it left me speechless on the moment, almost blushing i think, and terribly scared afterward. now i just feel even more judged outside and i'm scared to go back to my usual pharmacy. they know what i'm prescribed and i'm not even sure if they haven't said that out of pity or something else. i've grown so distant toward human interaction i am put at serious unease when one is """"""forced"""""" upon me like that.

3973,"so i've struggled with anxiety on and off for most of my adult life (i'm 34 now), but for some reason when there are issue with my computer, or in some case thing i perceive to be ""issues"" with my computer, i really have a hard time focusing on anything else, especially when something i've found is not really ""fixable"", if that make sense. there will be certain irregularity regarding thing on my laptop that, while not causing my computer to break or malfunction, are still enough to not allow me to just ignore the issue.  it's like they are in this real annoying grey area, and part of me would prefer that my laptop would just blue-screen or my hard drive would fail (i back everything up on an external hd regularly) so i can go from being anxious and worried to irritated that i have to buy a new pc but at least relieved.

the latest computer issue had to do with my antivirus showing an issue with my computer on a network inspector scan, saying it wa ""accessible"" from the internet, but only doing so intermittently, going back and forth between good scan result and bad scan result with no consistency. after doing a ton of test and talking to an irl friend of mind who is good with computers, i narrowed it down to basically the ipv6 setting on my router, and wa told that there isn't anything to worry about on various reddit tech thread so long a my window firewall is still on and i haven't messed around with any settings.

well, then i got way too paranoid and started looking at my window firewall rules, analyzing everything several time a day, sometimes even an hour. i accidentally reset my firewall rule one time, but since then i have purposely reset my window firewall rule back to their defaults, doing so three time yesterday, including once at 2 am. why? because i'll look at the setting and the rule to see what they are, and even though i'm not changing anything - only looking at stuff, the most i'll do is look at the properties, but not making any change and hitting *cancel* instead of *ok* to not even accidentally change anything. even with this, there will be something i notice that i think ""wait, wa that always like that or did i inadvertently do something"", and so i'll reset the firewall setting again to see, in both instance that it indeed wa meant to be like that. but i still kept resetting them, which ha required uninstalling and re-installing several apps and program a a result so that i can use them again and a necessary firewall exception is created. all because i'm afraid that simply scrolling through the feature and looking at the ""allowed apps through window firewall"" and the advance setting lead to the possibility that i might accidentally change something, even though i know that i haven't.

so yeah, that's where i'm at with my anxiety right now. i know it's a really, really dumb thing to worry about, and like i've said when i have a potential computer issue i tend to get really anxious to begin with. this feel worse and more worrisome i think because the nature of the issue is a *potential* security vulnerability issue. (heavy emphasis on ""potential"" there). so far i haven't reset my firewall default today and i'm hoping that last night is the last time at least for a long time, and if i do it again or ob over anything related to it it's for an actual functional reason, not because i'm super paranoid.",anxiety

3981,"so ive suffered with anxiety for year now. but ive always managed to just kinda move on and live a semi-normal life. i actually came off sertraline about a year ago because i started to feel much better and felt i no longer needed them. 

then rewind a month and i wa racing down to the hospital at 5am to be with my mum who wa in the resuscitation unit of the a&amp;e. she wa unconscious and we were told she needed to head for emergency surgery within hour or she would die. but also that there wa a risk the surgery itself could kill her. so we were left with no choice but to tell them they need to do their best to try and save her life. family came down and we all sat in the hospital cafe for hour waiting to hear how it went. finally that phone call came and she had survived. she wa placed into icu and on a ventilator. she wa in for 11 day and she did amazing. her wound were healing well and she wa coherent. everything went a well a it could. we were absolutely blessed. i wa not ready to lose my mum being only 27. im not sure what i could possibly do without her. shes home now and recovering well. 

this is where i move onto my own issues. since this all happened ive developed my own issue that i believe are related to the trauma of what happened. so the first thing that happened wa i started having ectopic heart beat (pvcs). id never experienced this before. i didnt know what they were so i kinda just ignored it. then one night i wa lay in bed and got a series of them. this caused my body to go into a massive panic attack. heart rate over 160, shaking, more ectopic beats. i woke my sister up and got her to rush me to a&amp;e because i thought i wa experiencing something deadly serious. i lost control of my hand and face on the car. walked into a&amp;e, told them everything. sat down and managed to calm myself down. come to have an ecg and it come back fine. wait in a&amp;e overnight a it wa a 7 hour wait to see a doctor. have another ecg thats once again fine. doctor say to get a holter monitor and a thyroid blood test. still waiting on the holter results. thyroid came back fine. 

fast forward to now, my health anxiety ha completely taken over my life. whenever my heart rate get high i start getting the ectopic beats. so ive been avoiding any and all exertion where possible. i still do what i have to like cooking or cleaning. that wa until a few day ago. i wa stood in the kitchen cooking myself some food, when all of a sudden i felt incredibly dizzy and sick. heart beating out of my chest. i tried to sit down and do some breathing exercises. they didnt really help at all. i ended up calling 111 and they once again suggested i go to a&amp;e. so i did. i wa there 14 hours. checked over and everything fine once again. sent home with the all clear. 

im starting to think all these symptom are being caused by the stress and anxiety of almost losing my mum and how traumatic it wa to experience. but until i get answer or see improvement my brain just go into a doomsday loop of worrying about death constantly. i also have another health issue where i have migraine and swollen lymph node and pain when swallowing. this is being looked into by ent but it taking a long time. so not having any answer in regard to that is causing me a lot of anxiety a well. then there the awful chest pain and chest and throat tightness that i also know can be caused by anxiety a well. 

i suppose the purpose of this post wa to vent and get this off my chest, but also to ask if anyone else ha found that their anxiety cause them extreme physical symptom thats make you think the worst case scenario is what will happen and you get trapped into a doomsday loop of worrying.

i (m28) started my current job about 6 month ago. from the beginning, i have been thrown into the deep end with ton of assignment and right deadlines, meeting with coworkers and clients, and the usual staying late/working through my lunch (if i even get one) 

its a lot, and stressful but i kinda take solace in the fact that it fully remote so i can avoid the added stress of being in person and having to deal with commuting.

anyway, there this huge event happening this month and being that im local to where it will be taking place, my bos asked me if i could go. i wont lie, i knee jerk reaction said yes thinking it wa remote only to find out it wa actually in person.

after some thought i figured i should go since professionally it might be best. but, my bos ha the tendency to throw people into thing and put them on the spot during client call (which i havent been on many so far) nothing bad like calling you out on anything.  

she tends to want your input and want you to converse with the client and bring idea into the meeting. ive done my best in the past but this will be in front of multiple client and i (as an anxious person) am dreading it. it been wearing on me for a couple week now and i feel like im on the verge of an anxiety attack. i know i wont sleep the night before which make my mental health worse in situation like this. so, i dont really know what to do other than to tell her i dont want to speak. 

its tough because ive kinda hinted at that in meeting with my other bos and project manager but they seem to just say oh it would be fine though.

3994,"several year ago at a previous residence, the tenant who live below me practically stalked me. one thing that made me uncomfortable wa she would watch when i would bring my trash out and how much, then complain to the landlord if it wa too much garbage or not enough. if even one week passed and i didn't bring out a bag, she would tell them i wa hoarding garbage in my apartment.

over time, this came to be the case. the bag would pile up and my apartment (and a a result, the building stunk) because i felt so uncomfortable going out to the dumpster. i knew i'd have to walk past her apartment, and i knew she'd be watching.

years later, i am experiencing something similar in my new residence. i've lived here for several months, and about 2 month ago, my landlord contacted me saying a neighbor reported that i wa bringing out ""too many"" garbage bags.

first off, i pay for my own trash removal. there is no shared dumpster or anything like that, so it's not like there's a concern about limited dumpster space.

second, i am still moving in. i am still unpacking. i am still getting rid of stuff, and yes, some week i may have more bag than others. that really should not be anybody else's business. and there's no limit to how many bag i put out, i just pay by the bag. so whether it's 1 bag or 100, it doesn't matter. i am the one paying for it.

so yes, my garbage ha started to pile up again, my apartment smells. neighbor are complaining, and my landlord is texting me a well about it. but i am terrified to bring out the trash. they want it cleaned up, but i know somebody is going to tell the landlord i'm bringing out too many bags.

it's causing me stress and anxiety because i'm like... well, do you want me to take care of this or not? you want me to get rid of the garbage, get rid of the smell, but i can't put out too many garbage bag or you'll complain about it.

i, like many others, have no idea why i suffer from chronic anxiety and today i think i found out my problem for me. in my ""normal"" feel good, nothing wrong, life i experience what's likely ""normal"" level of anxiety. i get sweaty for date and my stomach turn for an interview. other than that i'm pretty stable and even for the worst of anxious scenario i'm not close to a panic or even anxiety attack. i feel like i can handle whatever come my way. to give context, in my ""bad"" state during period of chronic anxiety that can last a year or more, i can hardly feed my dog or lay in bed without being on the verge of breaking. 

i've now had two of these ""bad"" state in my life. the first in college that lasted about a year from onset to full recovery and the second that started in august 2021 and i'm still working towards full recovery. both of these time i had no idea what caused it. i went from functioning normally one day to feeling kinda gross the next to being catatonic a few week later. 

so today i stumbled across an article that i'll link below that explained the connection not only from anxiety to muscle tension but also, most importantly to me, from muscle tension to anxiety. i now know that chronic stress can slowly increase your tolerance for muscle tension so you may not even notice it growing and compounding. out of control muscle tension can buildup stress hormone and regular, totally normal, acid that when beyond your body tolerance can cause anxiety. 

for me the first time i had chronic anxiety enter my life i wa entering my junior year of college. the summer before i wa working a factory job about 45 minute from home and rotating first, second, and third shift a a temp. i wa also doing a set schedule internship. i would work 60+ hour a week for 4 month which in itself isn't terrible but working day twice a week for the internship and then days, evenings, or night every other available day for the factory wa a lot and destroyed my sleep schedule. i had no day off and no time at home that wasn't spent sleeping. i also had other stressor in the back of my head like the upcoming junior year capstone and my first real apartment. anyways, this second time wa comparable too because i had a relationship end and another start and end along with leaving one secure job for another startup on top of a loved one dying and working out 6 day a week for 2 hours. on top of that i took an lsat exam and wa passed by for a promotion that wa mine. both time i had a slow buildup of stressor and never really gave myself relief because i didn't feel like i needed to. i felt completely fine. then very quickly i wasn't. 

what happened to me and what i suspect happens to many people who don't know why they suffer from anxiety is this slow buildup and tolerance of muscle tension that, a explained in the article, lead to a chemical buildup that eventually your body can't keep up with. you then start having regular psychological anxiety that in turn feed more muscle tension which feed more psychological anxiety which feed more..... and what's fucked up is i'll feel completely fine, unstressed and good, until my body can't keep up. personally, and this may happen to others, i then slip into health anxiety because i have no apparent reason for feeling this way. it's a dark spiral that i can't explain to a therapist because i don't know what's going on or how the hell i got here. 

i do now though. for me it's the chicken that came before the egg, the muscle tension that lead to anxiety. i fancy myself a one of those hard working lay it on me i can handle it type and for a while i can be but i need to learn my breaking point. 

hope this help someone a lost a i was.

4016,"so this is a post that i made in a chronic illness subreddit, i don't know where to turn and i'm just trying to reach out and see if anybody know what this feeling might be or if this sound familiar. i have these horrible feeling that i can't put into word and i just need to talk to somebody or reach out to someone even if it's on internet, i feel like i might lose my mind. i think there's something seriously wrong with me. maybe there's someone on the subreddit who ha been in a similar situation somehow. i'm just going to copy and paste it i guess. 


i'm freaking out and i just don't know where to turn, i could use some sort of advice. i feel like i'm the only one in the world who know what this is like - maybe not in a literal sense the only person on this earth who ha ever felt like this, but i'm in a very strange mental state and i don't know how to describe what i'm going through and this feel very unbearable. i guess what i'm trying to say is my situation feel unique, and that make it feel even worse, like nobody know what i'm going through and i just need to talk to someone. 

so quick background, i'm dealing with a lot of physical issue that i don't know the cause of. i have a lot of bizarre symptoms, i don't know what's going on in my body or how to explain my symptom fully. i have dozen upon dozen of symptoms, pretty much entire body is affected. i'm so uncomfortable, i can't stand this. there's too much suffering, like i just can't bear existing in my body. what's happening is i feel like i'm losing it.. like i can't bear this anymore. there's this feeling that i don't know how to explain  this feeling of extreme overwhelm and these horrible emotions. it feel traumatic. i feel like i can't handle the discomfort and the pain in my body, i can't escape it, and it's causing me anguish. honestly i doubt the doctor will ever figure it out, they haven't been able to so far (aside from a few things) and i'm reaching a dead end. i don't know how to keep living like this, i can't get away, i don't know how to keep doing this and i'm overwhelmed and i feel like i'm suffocating (metaphorically). i can't cope with the thought of living like this for the rest of my life. i also feel like something is wrong with me mentally with how i'm feeling right now, considering the intensity of feeling that i'm experiencing. it just doesn't seem right, this is very bizarre. i don't know what this feeling is or how to explain this. just this extreme overwhelm, everything i look at or hear make me feel worse somehow, and i can't stand my life or the emotion i'm feeling. that's the best way i can explain it. i don't know how to deal with this feeling or how to get rid of it. i've been dealing with this for a few some time now, sometimes i get a break but then it just come back again, and it's becoming more and more frequent and prolonged for the past few days. now the physical symptom themselves are not mental - i know that without too much context someone might ask about that, but i'm certain about that much. there are a few bit and piece to the puzzle of what's going on and they are undeniably physical which have been proven with tests, but in the grand scheme of all i'm dealing with this is a mystery. 

does anyone know what i'm talking about? this feeling of overwhelm that i am referring to? i feel like i need mental help or something right now. but i can't tell my parent (i'm 21 and live with them), they will assume that my physical symptom are partly mental, they have done this before when i've showed any hint of emotion and they are really not the type to offer emotional support. and the specific of my circumstance make me feel like not even a therapist could help me. i've been to a few before, for help with how to cope with my situation - and they didn't help at all, although i didn't feel a bad a i do now. i'm to the point that i want to end it to get rid of this intensely horrible feeling - i'm not actually going to do anything, i would be too scared to and i have no way to actually do so, i only get relief when i sleep so that i no longer feel any of this. when i don't physically feel a bad, i get relief from the mental feelings, but i don't get relief from many thing physically very much anymore. 

there's one therapist (only one in the area) who specializes with working with chronic pain patient that might be able to see if she ha opening in january, but that's only medicaid approves it, and i don't know how to stand this for another second, let alone another month. i don't know what's happening to me, and being alone with it in the feeling that it's so strange and unusual make it even worse. not only do i have these strange problem with my body but my brain is fucked up too. i know it's probably an effect of what's going on with me physically, i wouldn't feel like this if i weren't sick, but still. please, if there's anyone out there who know what this feel like, or ha any advice or something, please tell me. this feel like torture and i am losing my mind.",anxiety

how y'all doing?

i've just meet this girl, actually i know her for a couple of month but she wa dating and recently become single, i've decided to make my move and it worked out, we had some pretty good time in the last few weeks, but this cloud called ""anxiety"" started to kick-in, and this is how it kick in:

- my anxiety impair me of working 100% my capacity, a i'm constantly beeing ""sufocated"" by this cloud, the term cloud is used here because this how anxiety make me feel, like i'm surrounded by this shapeless cloud, that's constantly dragging me down. 

- at home i just want to laydown and think on my life, trying to relive past memory to make me feel slighlty better.

- i'm constantly thinking in messaging this girl (maybe this help create this ""cloud"" that i'm mentioning), just to chat  and to know how she's. i know that chating with someone is not harmfull, but the problem is that i'm constantly thinking on it.

- i'm wondering if she's fond of me in the same way, and i start to think that i'm not good enough.

i know that right now the trigger to my anxiety is this new person. and this happens everytime i meet someone new, my anxiety kick-in like a wild turbo diesel truck and during my experience with the person it decay till i do not notice it anymore. the problem is that in this ""heavy phase"" i do suffer too much.

i have been ""nocturnal"" for my whole life. by this i mean, i simply prefer night. i function better when it's dark out. daytime is very difficult for me. i think the origin of this are because i wa a high level athlete in hs, took a nap on the couch between school and practice for \~1 hour, got home from a 4-6 hour practice \~10:00pm and did my homework late at night (into the early hour of the morning if i had an essay or project due). i generally don't sleep much. this is not the problem, though. i function just fine during the day and sleeping more than 5 hour a night make me incredibly anxious and depressed. it's best for me if i get le sleep. yes, i have talked to my doctor and my therapist about this and they agree that i just naturally need le sleep for some reason.

however, i am now an adult in a long-term relationship, i work remotely on my own schedule, and i have lived with my partner for the last 3-4 year now. for the first few years, everything wa totally fine. we weren't even on opposite schedule or anything because i needed le sleep. they would go to bed around 1am typically and i would have time to do my work between 1-4ish. it worked very well.

the last year and a half or so, i have become incredibly anxious the moment they fall asleep. some wild crap happened to me while i wa finishing my senior thesis in college a couple of year ago, i had some suicidal tendency for a minute (finally recovered from that, at the current moment), and developed some strange abandonment issue and a general inability to be alone for fear of where my mind would go. i think this is the origin of this problem. since this problem developed, i have asked my partner to stay up a while longer each night but i can't keep doing that because it is bad for my mental health and their physical health. i have also tried using substance (alcohol, cannabis) to try to make myself sleepy earlier than i naturally would be, since they help me get to sleep, but the physical effect (not to mention the effect on my daytime anxiety) are too great for those to be a long term solution. i don't want to develop any sort of dependency on either my partner or on substances. i guess it's just the prospect of being alone at night that is scary. i'd like to return to what is normal for me, instead of trying to go to sleep at 1 or 2 when my partner is sleepy.

i do not need sleep hygiene suggestion or suggestion to help me get to sleep. i need suggestion for how to deal with being alone at night while the rest of the world is sleeping. it is my favorite part of every day and i currently cannot enjoy it because the anxiety that my partner and dog will be asleep and i will be alone is too much.

thank you in advance to anyone who read this or offer any suggestion :)",anxiety
4050,"since a week, i've had chest pain that come and goes. when i woke up yesterday though, my pulse wa too high. i had between 90-120 resting bpm and tachycardia that felt like my chest wa exploding from inside. thought i wa dying so i went to the emergency. had ekg and blood test and turn out my heart is healthy and there is no sign of any heart problem seen on the ekg chart and blood test. turn out it's a full blown anxiety attack. got an iv fluid and my heart rate returned to normal after 5 minutes.

a day full of attack left me tired and today i woke up like a truck hit me. even now that i know my heart is healthy, i still get some little anxiety attack here and then. like right now my body is in fear of literally nothing. but knowing that i'm healthy, i just don't care about my high pulse and it subsides some time later.

if you have or had similar heart experience like me, just know that anxiety is really a good imitator. it can mimic sign of disease and you should not worry about it. chance are you're good, but get a check in hospital just in case. hearing that there's nothing wrong with your health help tremendously controlling the anxiety.

my friend know that i have a lung problem, but i've never explained to them what it is and how is affecting my physical and psychological health.

now i'm 20 year old and i recently had a surgery, that seems to have solved my problem permanently. the surgery wa in september and i'm still recovering, slowly.

the thing is.. i want to explain to my friend what is (hopefully was) my lung problem and how affected my life (which explains also why i don't talk much and why i'm scared of doing certain things: run, jump, long walk etc...).

every time i start speaking about this, i start shaking, i feel cold and i start seeing flashbacks. i also start iperventilating and sometimes i get panic attacks.

4056,"**im making this post for my boyfriend, because i feel at a loss, and dont know what to do anymore.**

tldr :

my bf ha a stress compass that go from 0 to 100. i dont know how to successfully help him correctly see the true importance (or unimportance) of things. he used to take med that fixed this, but had to stop for medical reasons. now he been taking xanax almost everyday for the last few weeks, just to manage his panic attacks, and im scared hell become addicted. maybe some of you have gone through the same type of anxiety, and might have some helpful advice to manage it.

.................

he suffers from general anxiety disorders, and had to stop taking his med a year ago, for fertility reasons. were trying to have a baby, but ive had 2 miscarriages. so we are now going through ivf. were 34 and 35(me), weve been together for 12 years.

the whole ivf journey is extremely tough on it own, but were now also having to deal with his crippling anxiety. he often ha panic attack where i have to talk him down, and almost behave like a life coach or therapist 24/7.

all of his anxiety ha to do with his job.

its an important job, at a french institution, with a lot of work.

but it also a good job with really understanding and empathetic bosses.

the problem i think is my bfs **stress compass**, **which only go from 0 to 100**. thing that should be mildly annoying become extremely stressful to him, because in his mind they are extremely important. and i have to spend hour trying to make him realise that they are not.

i think the trouble is that he wa raised to be the perfect student, and being anything le that perfect is wrong in his mind, and he feel like he always ha to perform perfectly. when he doesnt (which is often) he feel like an imposter, always having to make it up, to hide his flaws. even-though his boss have continually told him that he doe a great job. he wa even given a small promotion and a raise, when he never asked for it.

his job is very demanding though, a they havent hired enough people to do the job needed (it used to be a team of 3 phd and he been on his own with another person who under-qualified and who he ha to help do the job properly.)

this anxiety ha been going on since he wa a kid, (maybe triggered by his father death ?) and focused mainly on responsibility (he had panic attack about his little sister getting kidnapped ??), hypochondria (which he managed to completely kick) and studies/job (hes only been working for two years, but it wa the same during his phd.) i personally think this all come from the way he wa raised, with his mother putting a lot of pressure on his sister and him regarding what is **right/correct/acceptable and what is not.**

i used to have agoraphobia for years, but managed to kick it, thanks to cognitive therapy and hypnosis : so he ha now started the same type of therapy.

however, this situation coupled with our struggle to conceive and the miscarriage ha been very hard to deal with.it feel like an imaginary burden we have to carry in addition to everythinga burden his mind his putting on our backs, and we would like to find a way for this to stop.

i know it possible, because i got rid of my agoraphobia and he doesnt have any hypochondria anymorebut we still havent found how.

hes at a point when he now ha to take xanax almost everyday for the last few weeks, and **im scared hell become addicted.**

maybe some of you have gone through the same type of anxiety, and might have some helpful advice to manage it.

my boyfriend (24m) and i (24m) have been dating for about 6 months. we were best friend for many year before we stated dating, even lived together for a while (all ha been and still is well). we have a deep connection and understand each other in way others do not. we have a very open dialogue with each other and are not afraid to sit down and have difficult conversations. an area i feel i have a short-coming with is understanding his anxiety and how i can help or what i can do during the time he's feeling anxious, overwhelmed, etc. there are time when he just wake up anxious (this specifically confuses me). but also, he ha a bit of a darker mind and can/does go down a dark rabbit hole/thought loop which will cause him to feel quite anxious this make sense. i can understand how it would make a person anxious. however, i don't really know what i can or should do in time like these. 

 \--- he say me just being around him help for a couple reasons:

1) i'm a talkative guy. i can talk about a wall to a wall for hour and he say me talking allows him to focus on my thought and idea instead of his. 

2) my thought and idea are usually all butterfly and rainbow (joyful and optimistic). 

3) just being there, with him, in the same room, make him feel comfortable. 

\--- is that all i can do for him? should we talk about what's making him anxious or no? he usually doesn't like to because it will ""kill a vibe.""

can somebody explain anxiety to somebody who doe not fully grasp what anxiety is. i guess i'm looking for the who, what, where, when, why, how on anxiety. please send a link if you think the response required is too lengthy or you know someone somewhere with good information and is easier to digest than a psychology course.

4076,"     .
that includes people who seem to be popular. why? because often it is not thequantity of friendsbut thequality of friendshipsthat determines whether a person feel lonely. someone who seems popular could constantly be surrounded by people but have no real friend and therefore feel lonely.

      .researchers who analyzed the result of 148 study concluded that low social interaction is a predictor of early death and that a a risk factor, it is twice a harmful a obesity and equivalent to smoking 15 cigarette a day.

    . in fact, it could cause you to settle for anyone who would accept you a a friend. when youre lonely, you may be desperate for attention, say a young man named alan. you could begin to think that any attention is better than no attention. and that can lead to trouble.

     . i could text or e-mail a hundred people a day and still be incredibly lonely, say a young woman named natalie. a teenager named tyler feel similarly. texting is like a snack, whereas face-to-face contact is like a meal, he says. snack are great, but you need a full meal to feel satisfied.

i have a weird anxiety cycle. i've never met anyone irl who ha expressed that they have anxiety like mine. everyone i've met ha a situational anxiety, like they get anxious when there is actively a stressful event happening in their lives. which doesn't take away any validity, but it's hard to relate. they always tell me i'll make it through whatever is stressing me and it's like... nothing is happening. i'm living normally. i just start losing it every so often.

every couple months, my anxiety spike and i don't sleep. it trigger chronic pain a well. it just activates for no reason. i'll just be sitting, scrolling on my phone or reading, just generally relaxing when suddenly i get a rush that feel like a tidal wave of cold sweat. it start at my head and run down to my feet. i think it's an adrenaline rush? maybe? then my heart start pounding. i can feel it thumping right out my chest, feel it throbbing in my temples. i start trembling and get nauseous almost immediately after the pounding heart. and it go on like this for hours. i once had this happen for about 7 hour a few year back.

i got a new job a few month ago. i like it quite a lot actually. i'm performing really well and am congratulated often for my achievement thus far. i'm very proud of myself because i finally found a job i don't viscerally hate and that i feel like i can excel in... but now my anxiety cycle is starting again. 

this week, i've been burning through my sick leave. i haven't been sleeping well, if at all. that heart pounding, adrenaline rush thing ha been happening at least once a day.

i don't know what to do. i've been taking some hydroxyzine to help, but it doesn't touch the anxiety. i've taken like 8 tablet in one day and it didn't put a dent in anything. i feel like it's a hopeless endeavor. i've been dealing with this my whole life. i'm approaching 30 and have had spotty employment due to this anxiety cycle. i even took a couple year off working a few year ago (partner and i were thriving just off one income at this time) and i still had this cycle happen without having a job... so i know it's not employment that is stressing me.

on a more frightening note, besides the physical symptom i feel a if my mental health is seriously at risk. imagine someone who constantly fear death and feel a if they will die at any moment. i don't want to do anything crazy or lose my mind but i feel like that's what's happening here. i'm panicking and i don't know what to do.",anxiety
4091,"i got my first office job back in march 2021 but it wa temporarily remote due to the virus. 

in november 2021, there wa a sort of meet and greet that my manager wanted newer employee to go to. i pretended i wa sick and skipped it. 

early this year, my manager mentioned to  u that people are heading back to the office 2-3 time a week and that we should try for at least 1-2 times. he never explicitly said it wa mandatory so i just continued to work from home. i know a few other people did so a well. 

so up till now, i never went to the office. ive never even met my coworkers. i thought that id go to the office only if it wa explicitly made mandatory. plus due to the nature of my company, all the people i directly deal with live out of state or even out of the country. my interaction with them are team meeting with camera off. so even if i went to the office, id still be doing the same thing. 

this evening i got an email from my manager telling u about a town hall style meeting and he want all employee in the state to show up in person at either of the two office locations. and im quietly freaking out. i cant do it. 

ive always known id have to go to the office eventually but now that it seems more imminent, it terrifying. i cant bring myself to go, especially because the meeting will also be accessible on teams. but i cant think of any excuse not to go. plus if he asks me about not being there, itll open another can of worm about how ive never been to the office. i dont even have access to the building. i wa supposed to get access month ago but i wasnt planning on going to the office at that point so i didnt bother. 

ive thought about find a permanently remote job but job hunting ha always been a nightmare for me. i feel completely unprepared and whether or not it imposter syndrome, it feel real to me. i just know deep down i would crash and burn in a real interview and the only reason i got this job is because the recruiter wa desperate and the interviewer didnt really give a shit. 

i know i have a problem. i know i fucked up. i feel like an idiot because i cant adjust to adult life even though im almost 30. i know i need therapy or medication or both but i cant even bring myself to do that because i feel like it wont help me fast enough and i need to fix myself asap. 

i wa doing okay for a while. i wa deep in my comfort zone but i wa content. but i know im not truly okay if one small thing like this can just absolutely wreck me.",anxiety
4092,"i have been having some issue with my health since september (mainly on the line of my gut health but since a month some internal vibration have started mainly in legs). initially i wa able to control my anxiety because i wa sure it wa coming from my gut and i wa already being treated for it. however, when my leg started vibrating internally, that's when i went into a bad spiral. it felt like my leg were not at rest even when they were and that just freaked me and i kept looking for answer online which obviously didn't help and made me feel so nervous. the thing is, i am able to control my breathing at most time and even when i am anxious, my heart rate is still very much around 60-65 bpm. that confuses me because i thought anxiety should at least increase heart rate. i also am not sure how my body could be vibrating internally for no reason whatsoever. is anxiety to blame for this? how doe one deal with illness anxiety and stop making thing worse for themselves?",anxiety
4093,"tw for vomit and tmi for poop talk! 

im emetephobic (fear of vomit) and my dad started being sick sunday night. obviously this struck the fear of god in me so ive been staying in my room, using my own bathroom, washing my hand and not touching my mouth. ive been mega stressed about catching whatever he has. tonight i wa particularly bad. my hand and foot were cold and i wa shivering even with pjs, socks, a cardigan and 2 blankets. i get diarrhea a a normal anxiety symptom but man. i wa straight up pissing out my ass. like 10 times. then i nearly fainted on the toilet. didnt end up doing it, i lay down on my bed because i wa not about to be found like elvis. then the dreaded vom happened. the last time i vommed it wa out of stress but i didnt have the other symptoms. could this have all been from a panic attack? or is it more likely i caught what he has? it seems almost impossible because i haven't been around him at all or touching any surface downstairs. sorry this is nasty and thanks for reading ",anxiety
4094,"to sum it up, when i see my friend doing stupid shit all i want to do is scream in their face that theyre screwing up and being stupid, even though i know they will learn themselves. i know this come from me being raised to hold my ground and have my guard up, so naturally when i see people not doing so i try to tell them not to but i know they will do whatever they want at the end of the day. i will literally get into fake argument with my self about it and let theyre bullshit eat me alive.  i have anxiety and know im overthinking but man people are so fucking stupid sometimes. why do i feel like i need to fix everyone?",anxiety
4095,"itll just be wave of an anxious feeling for a few minute randomly throughout the day. it feel like the feeling you get right before giving a speech or if youre really stressed, except i have no cause. i know i should obviously trust my doctor but i took 80mg 2 hour ago and it still happening. im on 100mg ssri aswell",anxiety
4096,"ive (f25) dealt with anxiety for most of my life. ive been diagnosed for a few year now. but the past couple week ive had a strange feeling ive never experienced before. it started with a bad constant chest pain for a few week and then i started getting this mini episode you could say. it is only for a split second and then go away. the best way i can describe it is like when you go on a drop on a rollercoaster and your stomach drop and your whole body is tingly. it happens all throughout the day. i went to the er and they said it wa just anxiety, but ive never felt this sensation before.",anxiety

4098,"i'm not sure if what i ask make sense but sometimes i feel that ever since start on medication i no longer bite my tongue a much and find it far far easier to speak my mind or tell others off.

i'm not sure if this is due to recent life experience changing my outlook on life or due to the medication they both sort have occured at the same time.

it's almost like there are time i'm not afraid of the consequence of my action which... is not like me.

4101,doe anyone else feel huge irrational anxiety when handling any kind of sharp object?  any time im handling a knife in the kitchen or a box cutter opening amazon box i get incredibly nervous.  i think it the sheer fact that a knife can cause harm so for some reason i get very tense and overly careful when handling it.  my mind go ten step ahead to every possible accident that could happen with this thing.  i want no harm to come to anything or anyone while it in my hands.  this is the same reason ive only ever been to a gun range once and never again.  holding a gun is wayyyy too scary for me.,anxiety

4103,"at first my psychiatrist put me on prozac for 2 day or 1, which i went to the hospital because i experienced bad side effects. then she put me on zoloft 25 mg, they gave me 1 in the hospital, and i took one at home the next day, and iv experienced pretty much every bad side effect. i quit cold turkey after the 2nd day. after day im still experiencing withdrawal symptoms. brain zaps, extreme anxiety, confusion, detachment, dissociation, shaking, jittering, numbness in my head, dry mouth, increased intrusive thoughts, headaches, diarrhea, cry spells, panic attack. you name it, iv been experiencing that for the last couple of day and only now getting better slowly. but now i feel like im having sensory issues, i feel like my hearing ha decreased a little bit, and my vision is more blurry than normal. i used to have palpitation which i got used to from anxiety, but i dont really feel the palpitation anymore which cause me anxiety because im used to them now theyre gone? all i know is that im never getting on prozac or zoloft again. it wa the most worst experience of my life. can you recover from the withdrawal and how long if you took 25 mg for 2 days?",anxiety
4104,"can i get someone outside opinion on this??

so i've been playing with these two teammate for six going on 7 years, and i really think they started to dislike me. over the past year we've all been becoming more and more skilled at our sport- and i've recently committed to play in college. one of the girl ha always been standoff-ish and a little le than friendly, the other girl is pretty nice and we've recently made good conversations. i'm someone who's always kept to myself about my opinion and arguments. not to be egotistical, but the three of u are the most experienced player on our team- and since our coach isn't able to coach because of our school rule at the moment, he left the three of u in charge of drills. yesterday wa the first practice this way and the two of them only talked to one another about what our team can do. during passing, stretching, and up till the point where i had to make myself feel like an as by coming in and adding my opinion. they didn't even turn to face me all the way. fast forward a little bit and we have practice tomorrow and i wanted to assert myself and kind of remind them that i'm a part of this too. so i made a group chat with the three of u and asked, ""so what're we thinking for tomorrow's practice??"". the fact that i even used ""we"" instead of ""you two"" seems wrong for no reason? i'm worried they're messaging back and forth right now telling each other not to answer me. it's been an hour since i messaged and nothing yet but maybe they're busy?",anxiety

4106,"i've had anxiety for a long a i can remember and because of past trauma that stem from my girlfriend, who i'll call a, i've been very paranoid and anxious in the past, which sometimes led to destructive behaviors.

but that wa month ago, and now a and i are very happy and i'm much more chill than i used to be. however, i still have bad feeling about a's best friend, d. she hasn't done anything directly to me, and she's been a great support to a so i don't try and convince a to cut her off. i hope this is enough context because like every situation it go back so far so this is really only the bare bone of the issue.

i've gotten really good at controlling my word and my action and not hurting other people with my anxiety, so that's not what i need advice about.

last night i knew that a wa going to be gone for \~30 minute for a club with all of her friends, including d, and i wa very distressed. i wa scared of d manipulating her, her leaving and i wouldn't be able to find her, her being gone, and other fear relating to the theme of her being gone and me not being able to find her. general separation anxiety-i wa able to handle that well with the assurance of a.

however after school i have practice and a wa going to hang out there because she ha bass lesson that start around when practice ends. everyday she hang out with d before she ha to get on the bus,but because both her and d were staying after school they walked around for \~20 minutes. and i went crazy.

completely internal, despite the fact that i wanted to go physically crazy and try and find out where they were going or what they were talking about, i stayed calm and went to the bathroom and dealt with my feelings.

but the feeling i had were so intense and also physical. 2 hour before practice, i had a pit in my stomach and had a hard time focusing on my work. and, when i first saw them walking (because i wa walking my friend down to the bus where d and a happened to first meet before they started to walk around) i felt sweaty, pale, and lightheaded. i had to go to a bathroom where i splashed water in my face. then, while they were walking around and i wa at practice waiting for her to show up, i wa crying, breathing quickly, and muttering to myself while pacing in the bathroom and practically breaking my stress ball in two.

because i feel convinced that d is a dangerous person who will manipulate a into leaving me, and she'll hurt a and i won't be able to protect her. i'm convinced that she's scheming against me because she love and is obsessed with a. and, just today, i got the small thought that maybe a ha already been manipulated and is somehow a part of it (this thought is much smaller than the others however it is still there).

i don't know why i feel like this or why i feel it so strongly, and it's driving me crazy. it hasn't been this intense ever and for some reason, it feel like i just broke today and i really don't know what to do about it.

a know about all this, and i've communicated it very calmly and i'm trying to believe it when she tell me she's not being manipulated, but how would she know that? i get so scared and upset at the thought of them being alone where i can help her or hear what d is saying to her.

i make it very clear to a that i don't want her to stop being friend with d and i want her to have a very vibrant social life, even though the idea of her being gone terrifies me. a very small part of me know what i'm feeling is irrational but 90% of me belief it's true and it's terrifying to think about.

i keep trying to distract myself, and i will keep trying. and, i keep trying to give myself grace for how i'm feeling but, despite the fact a doesn't say it's true, i'm worried i might be isolating a. i constantly check in with her and empathize that her not seeing her friend would make me more sad, which is true and she belief me. with d, i tell her that i'm glad she ha a best friend who she can trust even though every part of me want to remove d from her life because i think she's going to manipulate and hurt her.

it's very conflicting and my level of belief varies but usually stay over 50%, and i'm not sure what would help me.

&amp;#x200b;

tl:dr - i'm having very intense belief that i worry are boarding on delusion regarding a friend of my girlfriend, who i think is manipulating her. these feeling ebb and flow but remain fairly strong. i have issue with separation anxiety and i've had anxiety most of my life.",anxiety
4107,"hello, im starting birth control tonight but im really scared of the side effect i might get. i have severe anxiety about starting new medication (it took me 3 week to start taking the antidepressants/anxiety med i wa prescribed) and im scared to start it. idk what im thinking will happen, maybe throwing up or something, but i cant stop worrying. i have taken multiple type of birth control in the past and i dont remember having any bad side effect from it, but that wa also before my anxiety problem developed. no matter how hard i try to reassure myself it isnt working. my boyfriend is trying to reassure me too, but i think it will help to get reassurance from people who have taken bc.

4108,"can anxiety be the cause of my sore throat, forehead pain and upset stomach? all of these thing came on at the exact same time and the only correlation i can find is the frequent anxiety episode i've been having the past 3 weeks. i don't really see anyone and all my meeting are online so i don't think i've caught something from someone else. 
i can barely talk without my voice sounding like i'm going through puberty, i'm either hot or cold and my forehead feel like it's being stretched from my temples.
my symptom seem to get worse when i think about certain things, i tried not thinking about those thing but that's easier said than done. 

could this be anxiety induced or another health complication? can't see a doctor a they are all booked til next year.",anxiety
