,text,label0,i f struggle with self confidence i had a hard semester this past fall my dad had a stroke and i had a bad living situation that ha caused me a lot of stress and anxiety and ended some friendship i didnt so so well in my improv this year i am super hard on myself so i know some of it not true and have been worrying that theyll drop me ive been in the group for three year and like it a lot it can just be kinda stressful when some of the eboard isnt fully in it also a few people were dropped last year because of their performance the semester before  and it my last semester at school so i am worried that they are going to drop me even though i know thats unlikely ive just had a shitty year and im scared i havent been in therapy because ive been on break so i cant wait to start up i dont really know where this is going im just looking for some advice on building self confidence,anxiety1,every time someone take picture of me my face get red especially if there people are around i have a passport appointment next wednesday and i need to take a picture by then im anxious to go to walgreens and get my picture taken since they take it while people around are walking by,anxiety2,so at my school you can get a pas to eat lunch at the library but to do it you need to talk with a counselor about why you want it the space is filling up so if im gonna do it i probably should get it done this week but idk why i am so scared i dont really have a valid reason to tell them i just want to eat lunch in the library they always say yes too so it not like theyll just say i cant im more worried abt scheduling the appointment then going in tbh,anxiety3,lately im recognizing that my social anxiety come from having to walk on eggshell in my childhood home all the time up until i wa  i have to figure out a way to retrain my brain so i dont feel like i have to be so hypervigilant anymore i feel like i have to not rock the boat and care so much about how people react to what i say because im feeling like i need to appease others especially dominant and social personality type ie like my parent i need to accept that getting others to like me isnt necessarily going to get me parent that treat me well and care for me idk why i ever thought anyone else could replace them but here we are,anxiety4,this may not be the best place to post this but i feel this place would be the most understanding and not judgemental yk but basically i graduated high school in  but right after my life basically imploded and my college plan fell through and i instead had to move to a shitty living situation and take care of my dad because his health issue then when i finally could start thinking about college againi  put if off because my social anxiety in the last  year ha become it the worst it ever been and i couldnt even apply to school bc of the dread of going back and there and having to interact and socialize with people especially when i know im probably gonna be one of the oldest in the class at a community college at  i just feel so much dread at the mere mention of college pathetic behavior i knowbut i do need to get my shit together and stop being a burden so i am trying to apply to job that only call for a high school diploma but i am dreading the job interview well in general bc social anxiety but also because i have no idea how to explain the huge time gap between me graduating to now where i havent even gone to school or worked previously how do i explain that it so pathetic and the only reason i have is that i let my social anxiety consume me,anxiety5,im  and had severe depression from  just before october i wa getting better but then i came back to school after being ill and my social anxiety began to get worse a all of a sudden people began to make fun of me for being quiet recently i began to have panic attack every night before school i no longer talk in public and my friend dont like me anymore i am so exhausted and honestly feel like giving up right now im scared for myself how can i prevent it from getting even worse i dont want this to continue im sick of it,anxiety6,it depends on the person but i feel like im talking in a fake voice to different people and ill try to change it but it impossible it feel like i cant talk loud or i talk too quiet it so strange,anxiety7,i hate how anxiety make me appear to others there are some people im really anxious around and it cause me to act awkward closed off and avoidant because im choking on my anxiety whenever i interact with them i cant help but get the feeling that they hate me and think im weird because of the way i act i know someone who needlessly rude but i dont know if it just their personality or if it only directed at me because i havent exactly been open or inviting of course all of it becomes a cycle that perpetuates itselfsome people will never know what im actually like and it depressing im like a shell around these people anyone feeling similar feel free to comment,anxiety8,im working on this in therapy but it still really difficult im trying to be more assertive in standing up for myself and telling people when they do something i dont like recently it wa my job supervisor who used an email with my government name they know i dont use my government name and dont like when others do either ive given them two different email with my new name they can use so i wa upset to receive an email today with an email i only use for official thing with mt government name i sent them a message asking them to please use the two email i gave them no response yet and it been hour ive been thinking nonstop about how i must have been rude for bringing this up and how they must think im rude especially because the email content wa about a great paid traveling opportunity i alsp turned down the traveling opportunity because it would be for a conference the thought of that is already anxiety enducing but now i alsp fear they think im ungrateful im just trying to set my boundary but i dont do it with a bunch of smiley face or heart emoticon i just say what i want to and this make me worry im beinf misunderstood and come off a ungrateful and rude but this is exactly what my therapist is encouraging me to do respond without thinking too much first,anxiety9,ive developed a fear of opening up to my anyone and telling them my feeling because im scared theyll see me differently even at the thought of opening up to someone i get super anxious ive tried to force myself but i still cant be completely honest because im scared theyll judge me see me a inferior think im pathetic i hate myself for it because keeping everything inside hurt a well i dont know what to do i dont know how to change this,anxiety10,i feel i get more or le mistreated because of my skin color doe anyone else have similar experience or may feel the same way in some regard,anxiety11,what are the alarm bell for which i can suspect that i really have a problem and that not everyone experience the same discomfort a me,anxiety12,everyday i have a constant lingering feeling of anxiety if anybody is around me i constantly feel like people are judging me ive had it since i wa about  or  ever since my dad passed away over the past  year ive begun having what i think are panic attack in social situation i can feel the anxiety building up and the second a bit of attention is brought towards me or i feel like people are staring at me i get extremely embarrassed and filled with adrenaline i feel myself on the verge of tear ive been depressed since i wa about  because of this but it just get worse and worse i think about suicide every day and i have no one to talk to once my mother took me to speech and language therapy i think they tested me for autism and they did a memory test and i never went back i remember she would say if i dont speak to people il have to go back my problem got worse and worse but she never thought anything about it i dont know what to do anymore sorry for my bad punctuation,anxiety13,there a girl i like in my office i think she might also like me but im not  sure she caught me glancing over at her and ever since she keep looking at me the thing is she never smile at me so i dont know if shes looking because she like me shes annoyed or another reasonive asked my friend about it and the usual response is just man up bro and ask her out but it not that easy for me because with my  social anxiety just her looking at me get me flustered and self conscious i want to talk with her maybe even low key flirt with her even though im useless at flirting and i hate talking to people i dont know with my social anxiety im very worried about making a fool of myself and i certainly dont want to come across a a creep so how should i approach this is it acceptable to just ask her out even though i dont know her any other tip or flirting advice,anxiety14,perhaps you dont realize it or remember it whether thats due to emotional suppression or you were too young but during your life you experienced negative abusive criticism that directly lowered your global selfworth that rendered you le expressive and more abusively critical of yourself the amount of the abuse you internalized is directly proportional to the severity of your social anxiety in thinking others are judging youputting down your worth this is a projection and it isnt in fact true you tend to interpret thing negatively so a to not go against your own belief because if you accidentally interpret something too positively it may bring judgment so besides the original people who abused you no one else see you that way they never got the memo nor would they agree with the memo if they were to get it because the kind of judgement that is feared is very much abusive and wrong,anxiety15,basically im kinda drunk right now and i want to go to the store to buy some more wine but for some reason im even more terrified than usual any advice ,anxiety16,you dont care what people think about you and it not you pretending to not care you just literally dont care because you feel you arent doing anything wrongyou also know that if someone ha an issue it is their responsibility to be straightforward about ityou realise that the only people that matter are those who are responsible for giving you a roof over your head the rest is ego pleasing,anxiety17,this is a repost i made this post more than a year ago my personal experience of the usage of this exercise liberated me from social anxiety i strongly recommend that you try this out if you suffer from social anxiety if you are afraid of not knowing what to say how to greet people in public or being afraid of being boring this is the cure most of the thought that people with social anxiety experience are cognitive distortion see list below if you suffer please try this a few time if you dont you might be missing out on something that could turn your life around in a  that is what happened to me it could happen to you a well so for your own sake try ampxbrepost hello this is cbt exercise which is in your head all the advice and the execution of the exersice come from the book the coddling of the american mind written by jonathan haidt and greg lukianoff the book in itself is not about cbt more about adressing certain college campus behaviour nontheless they offer a cbt guide from other author dont know their namei figure i should post it hust to help anyone out there who struggle really hope this post doesnt get lost it helped me and i want it to help a many a possible atleast give it a try for any question just askedit i think the nine intructions are presented by the author originating from cbt research however seventeen distortion are originated from the book treatment plan and intervention for depression and anxiety disorder second edition by robert l leahy stephen j f holland and lata k mcginnthe cbt exersice when you are feeling anxious depressed or otherwise distressed take a moment to write down what you are feeling write down your level of distress for example you could score it on a scale of  to  write down what happened and what your automatic thought were when you felt the pang of anxiety or despair for example someone i wa interested in canceled our date i said to myself this always happens no one will ever want to go out with me im a total loser look at the category of distorted automatic thought below and ask yourself is this thought a cognitive distortion write down the cognitive distortion you notice for example looking at the automatic thought in number  above you might write personalizing overgeneralizing labeling and catastrophizing look at the evidence for and against your thought ask yourself what someone might say who disagreed with you is there any merit in that opinion consider again what happened and reevaluate the situation without the cognitive distortion write down your new thought and feeling for example i am sad and disappointed that a date i wa excited about got canceled write down again using the same scale a before how anxious depressed or otherwise distressed you feel chance are the number will be lowerperhaps a lot lowerhere is the link for full text httpswwwcoloradoeduherbstsitesdefaultfilesattachedfileshowtodocbtpdfhttpswwwcoloradoeduherbstsitesdefaultfilesattachedfileshowtodocbtpdf i understand however that it might feel sketchy to click link therefore i posted the most important stuff here otherwise google the coddling of the american mind cbt that got me the linksidenote this exercise doe not specifcally focus on social anxiety some distortion might therefore be more prominent than others i would take a close look at distortion nr  mind reading  labeling  negative filtering  shoulds  personalizing  unfair comparison  emotional reasoning  inability to disconfirm and  judgment focusthese are guideline i would still recommend looking at all but you will probably notice that they are probably very relevant in your lifecognitive distortion mind reading you assume that you know what people think without having sufficient evidence of their thought he think im a loser fortunetelling you predict the future negatively thing will get worse or there is danger ahead ill fail that exam or i wont get the job catastrophizing you believe that what ha happened or will happen will be so awful and unbearable that you wont be able to stand it it would be terrible if i failed labeling you assign global negative trait to yourself and others im undesirable or he a rotten person discounting positive you claim that the positive thing you or others do are trivial thats what wife are supposed to doso it doesnt count when shes nice to me or those success were easy so they dont matter negative filteringyou focus almost exclusively on the negative and seldom notice the positive look at all of the people who dont like me overgeneralizing you perceive a global pattern of negative on the basis of a single incident this generally happens to me i seem to fail at a lot of thing dichotomous thinking you view event or people in allornothing term i get rejected by everyone or it wa a complete waste of time shoulds you interpret event in term of how thing should be rather than simply focusing on what is i should do well if i dont then im a failure personalizing you attribute a disproportionate amount of the blame to yourself for negative event and you fail to see that certain event are also caused by others the marriage ended because i failed blaming you focus on the other person a the source of your negative feeling and you refuse to take responsibility for changing yourself shes to blame for the way i feel now or my parent caused all my problem unfair comparison you interpret event in term of standard that are unrealisticfor example you focus primarily on others who do better than you and find yourself inferior in the comparison shes more successful than i am or others did better than i did on the test regret orientation you focus on the idea that you could have done better in the past rather than on what you can do better now i could have had a better job if i had tried or i shouldnt have said that what if you keep asking a series of question about what if something happens and you fail to be satisfied with any of the answer yeah but what if i get anxious or what if i cant catch my breath emotional reasoning you let your feeling guide your interpretation of reality i feel depressed therefore my marriage is not working out inability to disconfirm you reject any evidence or argument that might contradict your negative thought for example when you have the thought im unlovable you reject a irrelevant any evidence that people like you consequently your thought cannot be refuted thats not the real issue there are deeper problem there are other factor judgment focusyou view yourself others and event in term of evaluation a goodbad or superiorinferior rather than simply describing accepting or understanding you are continually measuring yourself and others according to arbitrary standard and finding that you and others fall short you are focused on the judgment of others a well a your own judgment of yourself i didnt perform well in college or if i take up tennis i wont do well or look how successful she is im not successful,anxiety18,i am at a stage in my life where i really want to express myself even though i dont know myself very well most of my life i stayed hidden i would just fade into the background which is due to many factor including my social anxiety an old peer reached out to me to hang out a few month ago and i explained to them that i have social anxiety and they still wanted to hangout i wa at a point where i wa open to trying this new experience we hang out and i am quiet  of the time i wa so nervousbut this person acted like they understood and like it wa okay after they stop talking to me and what hurt isnt losing out on a potential friend but in knowing that i haven improved with my anxietyeven though i wa working on it i have improved because a few year ago i would never have even replied to them or try to go out but i just dont feel like it enough how would you feel if this wa your situationto cope with my anxiety ive been trying different hobby painting binge watching show reading writing etcbut it not working a well a it wa in the past few month it wa originally helping me avoid thing but now i feel like i cant and in wanting to express myself ive started to want ppl around whod appreciate my authenticity but my social anxiety hold me backik this post is a bit everywhere but let me know how you effectively cope with your anxiety and suppressing your voice,anxiety19,i have an class in which the teacher expects everyone to participate even if i want to answer i am so worried about the fact that i would get the answer wrong and i dread going to this class everyday because he sometimes call on random people to answer i also dont do very well on this class so i finally got the courage to ask when the teacher free for extra help it wa going fine minus the stuttering and shaking until he asked me what i wanted to work on i told her it wa something i didnt understand in class she asked me why didnt you ask that in class ask that in class she said it in a pretty angry way and im pretty sure she doe not like me because i never participate i left right after and started uncontrollably cry i know it a really small thing but how would i go about thissorry for grammar mistake,anxiety20,basically the title i

enjoying their youth it make me feel so much regret like music video with  year old spending time with their friend partying socialising etc i spent most of my time at home sat at my computer,anxiety24,ive noticed that if i dont make the move to approach someone then nothing will happen and even if i do try to initiate conversation most of the time it just me basically interviewing the other person because they dont act real interested in having a conversation to get to know me my guess is because im naturally more tense because of my social anxiety that body language show to other people and make them not interested in conversing with me i am very easy going casual and engaged in conversation but maybe i just cant come across a loose enough for other people i dont think im that tight but maybe even just a little bit of tenseness is too much if so i dont know what to do about that,anxiety25,ive noticed that a lot of guy do this but i dont quite understand why before people get mad i am fully aware that woman do this too a guy friend of mine ha this issue to the max plus he asks how im doing and doesnt usually acknowledge my answer i cant tell if im just being over sensitive or whatfor context this is not a new issue the same friend ha a habit of texting other people while were talking in person usually this happens when im sharing something personal or painful other than these thing he really great it just the texting issue that give me a bit of pause any advice is appreciated,anxiety26,basically the title ive been drinking

sadly i just rejoined the server and start chatting in a general chat thinking it a vent  sometimes my eye dont work  i said a few thing i am rather uncomfortable saying rn  and the ppl started judging me so  bad  im not sure if they were just there for trolling others  i feel dumb now  pathetic  and i left the server  even one of the troll mod wa laughing abt this   soyeah  im a bastard  cant even make friend at a fucking server abt social anxiety,anxiety29,i made a dumb decision i really thought new year new me and got a job a a server i hate iti felt good because ive started going to the gym and thought if i can go to the gym by myself i can do anything my social anxiety is cured but i wa sorely mistaken everyone keep telling me im not loud enough and i dont know how to answer

too high but no i guess ive just been getting really bad anxiety attack from just being at school i couldnt even tell you what im anxious about it pretty much entirely physical which is probably why i wasnt able to register it a being anxiety before but holy fucking shit it feel like a huge weight off my stomach now not to have to constantly worry if my med were too high or how i wa going to treat my adhd if the med caused me to feel like this the question is obviously what now it not like i feel anxious like this in other place just school for some reason,anxiety31,i struggle a lot with the feeling that im always being perceived i work in a large store and i often have to walk all over for various task i feel so awkward and anxious thinking that customer and salesperson are looking at me

much,anxiety34,bc of social anxiety i literally never learned what topic to talk with people or continue conversation nobody ha the same interest a me because they dont know that much english or they think it is childish or plain boring this show in my friendship too because i can see my friend seeking each others presence more than they do with mine even if they dont say it outright it is obvious who is who favorite and i am definitely at the bottom,anxiety35,feel like i sound dumb when i speak and it make me self conscious,anxiety36,removed,anxiety37,accidentally saying nice to

because i dont know what to say or do i feel like if i dont say something it is rude but if i do say something it might be wrong or stupid i usually give people who ask for money anything i can but i am sometimes told this is not always what im supposed to do is there anything that i can do that is right everytime,anxiety42,i dont know why am i doing this i gave fake smile to some people that i

everyday in class or ride the bus together anymore thing were much more flexible and a social life meant a lot of activity and larger friend network than before i am lucky that though the friendship i made a freshman were left by none but me to drift apart that im still welcome to some circle gathering and invited to some outing though much le frequently than ever before i have no best friend only ever had one that now work in a different country but these guy still welcome me in when im out with them once in a whilei wish i could turn people positivity towards me into something positive about my own life but after the most casual meeting at a caf i just get haunted by souldraining negative thought that i just cope with by sleep and claiming depression the thought range from jealousy of mentioned career or relationship success a primary reason ive been off facebook and most social medium for year to feeling of inadequacy compared to the confident goodlooking goodgrades wellbuilt people around me with a finishing pinch of haunting review of every single awkward action i took in the sitting and whether my frind insisting to cover my tab at the caf wa aok or if id missed on social cue or maybe i made thing awkward by insisting too much i should pay before eventually yielding missing on the possible social cue to casually let it go with a promise id cover them next timei go home and i cant get all those negative voice out of my head i want to get a driving license work out study for my certificate exam spend time on a more productive hobby than ytredditgaming but all i do is drown in negative energy from the minimum interaction either spending an immense amount of time in a oneman argument or coping by immersing myself in aforementioned worthless scrolling and gaming silver lining is i dont actually see myself in a complete bad light or have such an unrepairable negative selfimage i believe im goodlooking with a downside of being a bit short  cm thats  although i manage to neglect my grooming on bad day creating a cycle of  and  day which probably easily ward off romantic interest from people around me im quite smart and had had academic success and a great cv before falling to depression in university and even then i maintain some top  percentile grade regardless im financially ok not exactly rich but do enjoy a lot of luxury for granted it just my negative interpretation of my social interaction how my social inadequacy translates to a sense of failure everywhere else and the maladaptive method i use to cope with the feeling keep getting the better of me every time i try to break out and keep me at a stalemate that will probably only become more horrible when i have to do selfmarketing in interview and join the working world but every time i try to do something about it i go in with a defeatist attitude that clearly never get anyone anywhere,anxiety58,hello everyone i wa hired a few week ago a a social worker for family with

arrived at the bus stop in front of my house i felt like i wa about to cry eventually i got on the bus and went to the closest bus stop to the school but when i got off i froze in place i really didnt have the strength to walk towards the school so i started texting my mom about how i wa feeling and how i wa sorry that i couldnt make it to school today either she replied to a couple of them trying to convince me to go to school and then she left the chat shes at work rn and im not expecting her to constantly pay attention to me so about  minute later the next bus came and i got on it and went back home my dad wa there because of a guy having to come to check something and he wa obviously surprised to see me i explained everything to him and he understood but he seemed a bit sad and started

taken every ounce of fight in me to keep going back despite setback after setback i only mention this because it seems so ridiculous that now that im finally in my last semester this field trip is so anxietyprovoking that it make me wanna just throw it all awayi know that it may sound ridiculous to even consider a field trip a a reason to potentially not get a degree especially now that i type it out anxiety is not always rational though a im sure you all know hahaanyways the field trip is the entire spring break with  student going to another state doing field work and rooming in hotel together every aspect of this sound terrible and scary to me to make it worse most people in the class already know each other and have formed friend group and i havent since im shy and usually end up on the periphery on top of that i dont wanna embarass myself in front of my professor that i know and like when i dont have a group or room to be in and have to say that assuming they let you pick your own groupsive hated stayaway camp and stuff with sport team in the past with that many people that are already all friend with each other and youre an outsider it suck to spend  feeling awkward and afraid to talk to everyone all day long and i dont wanna stay in a hotel room with people i barely knowdoes anyone have any advice on how to get through this this is required for my major and if i dont do it id be throwing away my degree and  year of college mess even so my anxiety is telling me to flee and acoid at all cost if it werent for this field trip id feel so much better about just finishing my degree but im scared it gonna be a huge roadblock or ill build it up so much in my head that ill have a mental breakdown during the semester and not be able to finishany advice or insight is greatly appreciated ,anxiety69,i dont know how to stop doing this everytime im alone walking i get so self conscious of every step i make and if i walk right and the more pressure i feel the

disable the chat function i wouldnt need alcoholdoes anyone have insight on this can you see something i cant see i need to understand why i do thisi think maybe the alcohol turn off the thinking part of the brain like it make my brain shut the heck up then i can play without worry so what doe that mean how do i fix this,anxiety71,i rushed my homework because i kept procrastinating finished them

my anxiety ha been off the chart my manager is extremely kind but extremely extroverted chatty hyper etc  the complete opposite of me behind my social anxiety that is during conversation i find myself processing information at an extremely slow speed causing me to freeze and panic when it is my turn to speak i often blurt out jumbled thought because i cant seem to form coherent thought let alone speak clear and concise sentence because of this it is so hard to from genuine connection but i just know deep down inside that i want to participate i want to speak i want to engage and i want to have meaningful relationship but the lack of retention jumbled thought and heightened anxiety make that all nearly impossible i just wish there wa a cheat code to all of this i wouldnt wish social

never go to party or anything like that but talking to classmate in school and now coworkers at my job is  not  easy but not all that painful but with people who are actually my friend i currently have  irl friend and it the worst with her but even with online relationship a soon a someone talk to me regularly and is close enough to be considered a friend huge anxiety kick in im terrified that the tiniest mistake in word or action something stupid or accidentally hurtful will make them sad or angry or super upset and hate me or judge me and leave forever it like this person like you now you better not do anything to ruin that and having that pressure just it suck,anxiety78,i applied for a job got called in to the interview interviewer asked me strange question then laughed at me i

alumna chapter with the intent of becoming an alumna initiate youre probably wondering why im doing this if i really have social anxiety but my hope is that it will help improve my social skill anyway in the beginning the president wa super helpful and communicative she usually make small talk and is very enthusiastic in the way she text our text conversation are usually very brief but friendly  we just chat about how were doing and discus my experience a few day after each alumna event but lately she stop responding whenever i reciprocate a basic question like how wa your weekend or if i share a brief story that is relevant to the topic of our convo no responseon top of that the vibe at the past couple event wa just really off it wa tense and uncomfortable im good at reading the room and something wa different the day of the last event i texted her asking for the address and she responded havent you been getting the email i told her i used to but havent gotten any in at least a month she didnt think that wa strange which wa weird to me but proceeded to send me the email with the information for that day event overall im getting the impression that she doesnt think im a good fit but shes technically not supposed to tell me that so shes being passive and hoping ill withdraw from the process is what im gathering some of the other woman have also become closed off and even rude to me which is a  compared to the first couple event i attended ive definitely had my moment of being socially awkward and visibly anxious at event but ive also shown great enthusiasm devotion and consistency toward the organization and the event i feel like i should just walk away from it but ive already invested so much time and moneydoes anyone else have insight on this doe it seem like it all in my head,anxiety86,i try i really do i cant take insult when people dont understand my situation to me i feel like people who insult me or who cant understand and accommodate me are just toxic

havent been outside in  year wa anxious about meeting a stranger and it went welli took some of the advice here like working it into the conversation that im shy i couldve said socially anxious but felt more comfortable saying shydoes anyone else picture all the thing that could go wrong before having to talk to someone it usually go nothing like imagined and it a habit im trying to break now i have something recent i can point at and say seesomething that helped wa that the woman i met wa talkative and positive and it easier to play off of someone el energy than to create it from scratch i tried to focus on my curiosity about a new person rather than what i wa doing wrong i still had stressful thought but it made me realize it possible to get enjoyment out of socializing if i let myselfi couldnt eat because i wa concentrating so hard on the conversation and wa nervous she mightve wondered about that but oh well sometimes just getting through a social event is success enoughshe told joke that im trying to learn from i try to watch how more outgoing people do itthe nicest thing wa she hugged me at the end and said shed invite me over sometime that made me feel like maybe she had a good time too i really hope so she didnt text back when i texted that she wa welcome back any time but shes a busy person so i wont think anything of it ill just replay the happy part so thatll be what i remember because life is shorti hope that if you also have social anxiety your next experience will be positive and that youll pat yourself on the back for having tried either way,anxiety95,every time i am called on in class or have to do presentation etc my voice shake and i know this is probably because of my anxiety but i find it so embarrassing im not sure how obvious this is to other people but it really bother me when i can clearly hear it when i speak it just make my confidence go down even more and i dont even want to speak up in class at all i feel like others would think im strange because no one else seems to have this problem and i also dont want others to think im super nervous every time i say something can anyone relate and how do you deal with this,anxiety96,basically i take solpadeine or nurofen plus once a day every day  i do have pain and it help at night  i feel i should be allowed to accept that and im spending based on the price increase around  a month which is hardly huge  my wife she always buy herself a paracetamol and ibuprofen box every week at the shop but i can bet you she doesnt beat hwreelf up like i am doingi have no intention of going to the doctor to ask for a script a i dont need it through the day or every four hour so it feel pointless  basically one day i will definitely not take them at night and likely go without but i am terrified when i go to pharmacy because of the question if ive been to the same one twice in a month or two they might look at me and report me to the police or they will report me and my name to the doctor that they wont serve me  my wife say well go to another one  now this would be the case with many thing a i have anxiety and not in occasion i have a gad and catastrophic thinking which is this whole thread  i would buy alcohol from store and always live in fear what do they think so avoid store  i dont really drink regular anyway twice a week maybe  why cant i just feel at ease with myself  why cant i just accept i take them but in well below rexxomended dos and not every four hour i know it not ideal but it hardly the end of the all thing and it a legal thing im doing yet i feel like an utter freak show  my sister take nurofen plus and solpadeine shes mentioned it and always say how good it is for headache she get she feel no shame and i seen a few box laying around her kitchen and my sister is treated a the smart one of the two of u the sensible one yet here i am beating myself up  i just want to walk into a store and ask for it knowing well i havent been here for like a month and a half so it hardly fair to make me feel bad different if i visited like twice a week or something which would naturally raise concern  just feel scared and worhtless hopeless and criminal and i honestly know i am not  im scared of any illegal drug and prescription drug or over the counter are all i would ever trust,anxiety97,my classmate just sent out the registration form and were supposed to give them back signed friday now ive already decided im not going i know i have no friend and i know ill never get a date so i know there really no point the fact that my parent would go make it even worse i have no one to introduce them to id just have to sit with them while everyone else smile and take picture there no way in hell im going but that make me feel so shitty i really fucked up everything,anxiety98,removed,anxiety99,manifest a life where your social anxiety cant exist a woohoo a this sound i got rid of my severe social anxiety ive only ever known one person on my entire life with worse anxiety after having it over  year how manifestationmanifestation is basically thinking and emotionally feeling a life that you want to have i wa accidentally manifesting the new life i wanted by watching youtube video of the life i wanted and feeling like i already had that new life didnt realize it at the time what i wa doingover the week of doing this for a few hour at a time my social anxiety literally magically vanished after about  week and i had a seemingly random  year goal that popped into my head i ran to a new state to out a creep and because i felt free from my mental prison and started a new life i cried every day for a month of happiness and wa having random conversation with complete stranger and felt completely comfortable a few month after moving i experienced the dark night of the soul basically where your entire life fall apart but for the better it fall apart in a way that make you shed your old fear like social anxiety i basically had all of my flaw and fear highlighted which wa really hard emotionally but i got through it in my dark night of the soul i literally had to face all of my fear and realized whats the point of not talking i experienced all of my greatest fear and still had anxiety so from that point on i realized i might a well talk the worst thing that happened to me happened because i had horrible social anxiety i learned my lesson from my dark night of the soul and im applying them to my new life now im awake to the fact that were living in the matrixsimulation and the old me doesnt completely exist if you raise your vibration eat healthy think positive start playing the part of the life you want to live and jump to your highest timeline and manifest and really believe physically and emotionally that you already have what you want in the future the universe will coincidentally send thing your way and create opportunity to get you there that  year goal that popped into my head after manifesting wa a coincidence and lead me to take other step that coincidentally had thing fall into placei used to be so miserable with having social anxiety and it wa ruining my life i passed my test aka dark night of the soul and i can finally live a life without social anxiety getting in the way there are no such thing a coincidence im convinced of it after dealing with all of that because it happened in such a way that make me believe everything happens for a reason i had to face all of my fear since childhood all at once for so many weird coincidental reasonsanyway i know many people here arent woke enough to even understand this or believe it a possibility but hopefully one day youll get there,anxiety100,i have a social anxiety a much a i can

domestic flight followed by a connecting flight to u  having never set foot in an airport i dont even know where to begin so if there are any frequent flyer here who can offer some guidance or tip i would really appreciate it,anxiety108,im f i used to periodically sign up for the gym but would stop going after a few week i understand that everyone is new to the gym at some point and that most people are only focused on their own workout but the anxiety of going in and just dithering around not knowing what to do is horrible id be so self conscious about using a machine wrong and looking awkward i wanted to use the barbell and do squat but if i could barely even walk into the gym room there no way i couldve squatted in front of everyone i wouldnt even know how to begin with fitting the weight etc recently ive wanted to get a personal trainer a i really dont know what im doing but that just seems like another layer of embarrassment my body is awkward and skinny and the sa make my mannerism kind of weird i feel like id be uncomfortable to work withdoes anyone have experience with getting into the gym or using a personal trainer,anxiety109,i m have noticed a weird pattern in my behaviour a ive noticed in people with social anxiety or that are introverted while they feel uncomfortable in large group of people and with people they dont know they feel extremely well hanging out with close friend for me it a different case  i feel completely uncomfortable and anxious hanging out with everyone albeit closer friend or even my parent for example once a handful of close acquaintance invited me to hang out but i felt so tired that i declined it just that constant stress constant thought wether i am good enough to talk to these people constant need to filter my speech and constant anxiety that i feel when hanging out is extremelly tiring to me the best leisure activity for me are those which can be done alone because i find myself incapable to do them with close friend or even family member,anxiety110,but i cant talk to anyone long enough to show it i miss having friend the feeling of someone being glad to see mei wouldnt like me either when the anxiety make me so awkward to talk with i just wish i could get past that so someone would see that im an actual person,anxiety111,i wa rejected too often by group or people the last few year that i stopped caring a about belonging wierd to sit in group therapy and not really wanting to be part of the group or part of my family or be part of anything really i started to value my hobby  and learning time more than finding friend or a group of people i want to be a part ofit defenitly save time to not worry about that anymore lol,anxiety112,this is my first time flying across an ocean by myself and it been crazy but im proud that i made it through without any tear or panic  one of my flight wa delayed and therefore caused the next flight to be rescheduled for  hr later  asking for help is already something i hate doing but in a foreign country even more intimidating  i also had to talk to  lady i dont know who are a friend of a friend who helped me and that wa hard for me to do  with their help i ended up upgrading to business class at a discount and getting a shower and food in the lounge  it can be scary but if you push yourself a little bit you can do it,anxiety113,how im walking how im sitting where my arm are my posture hell even how im breathing feel like im conscious of it all when im around people which probably just end up making me move weird lol,anxiety114,so ive never had a job because i never want to interact with people and my anxiety make me feel inadequate to work even simple enough job like retail or food service i would like to push myself to get some kind of job this summer and i thought babysitting might be a good start co im fairly good with kid and i wouldnt have to interact with lot of people regularly what discourages me though is that id assume most people want babysitter with experience i may be wrong but this idea add to my already existing anxiety about it all to all my fellow socially anxious people who have or have had job do you think it a good idea and what do you think my odds are since i have no experience also any advice on how to look like a better candidate for job in general if i dont have experienceany advice from experience would be great and also any more suggestion of good job for socially anxious people would be appreciated thanks ,anxiety115,my birthday is next week and my parent decided that ill have a

and it wa awkward and i kind of like my new room and the management are not allowing it due to some circumstance and i am having severe anxiety thinking about shifting back and facing my roommate a if it not embarrassing and awkward enough,anxiety118,they made me so suicidal idk made me feel like my insecurity were the biggest issue in the world i think im good now tho never again,anxiety119,i wa the kind of child that felt they had to earn their father love when i wa a kid my dad used to tell me dont call me daddy im not your dad anymore and refer to me a your daughter talking about me to my mom he called me a whore and a prostitute when he learned i kept my sa a secret from th to th grade ive worked with therapist to deal with the trauma of the sa but there is still residual resentment towards my dad and a fear of being judged for my behavior my ex used to shame me for being socially awkward around his friend one time we were taking a walk and he ran into an old friend a they were talking i continued to walk a little further up i didnt walk off too far but i wa just far away to not hear what they were talking about later that day he told me i made him look bad because i didnt stand right beside him and i need to stop being like that i have a tendency to do this because deep down i dont feel like anyone would actually want to be seen with me he judged me and that just made me more anxious of my behaviorive been seeing someone new alex m for the past  month and this past saturday wa the first time he introduced me to his friend at the bar we met them there and they were nice to me very welcoming the bar wa kind of empty and so it wa easier to relax but after that bar we went to another city hangout spot with a lot more people and i could feel all the eye one a we walked in the door alex held my hand the entire way through the crowd of people he introduced me to people who he knew there and made me feel very safe but he left me for a few minute to go order u drink at the bar and i thought i wa supposed to stand in place and wait for him to come back after some other guy hit on me i finally made my way over to alex he said in my ear ever so sternly stay close to me angie to which i obliged i get the sense it wa more of a protective i want you near me versus my ex youre making me look bad i didnt have to tell alex i struggle with social anxiety he knew and instead of pointing it out and making me feel guilty that im not making him look good he tell me im the smartest most beautiful woman in the room i really want to do better next time im around his friend or his family but i dont know how to get out of my own head and just be present,anxiety120,a a socially anxious introvert thing are changing in my current social life a group of girl in college smile at me and talk to me i avoid them often bc i dont really plan to become their friend tho it still change a lot compared to the past few year when i used to be way more alone at school in this group there one person i might become friend with so i talk way more to her it weird i notice my anxiety most when i talk to her since i intend to be her friend and scared i cant because i might not be good enough and stuff for her friendsthe group im le anxious around them but not familiar enough so it not rly comfortable and i dont wanna be with them a much there another person i started talking to it so different with her because we have deeper conversation and talk about music and what were both interested in so we talk way longer and it drain me a lot especially since im not comfortable yet around her i hope i can be one day tho it just so sudden she say she deal w some social anxiety tooi can see sometimes but she doesnt have any problem to go talk to me which i could have never done if she didnt so im grateful idk it is so hard to make friend w irl ppl so i dont even know if i should hope for a friendship or not it been so long since i havent been comfortable around someone and i need a lot of time to get comfy too  a i said it too sudden but it good i guess i dont avoid talking to that person since i hope to become her friend and we share a lot it just sometimes i wonder what for  im always so awkward and anxious maybe it wont lead anywhere sure it might help for my sa but i care more about making true friend especially currently should probably worry about my sa when i try to find a job tho if i keep trying im really curious how long itll take me to erase most of my sa around these almost friend  do i just need time   if anyones got tip to get more comfortable with someone let me know i really want this to succeed,anxiety121,im very tired from my sa so i want to know from some people who tried therapy if it actually work did you see any improvement  how many session did it take  can it really heal sa ,anxiety122,i often worry about how im perceived but try to dismiss those thought and reassure myself that most people probably never even notice me or think anything bad of me but occasionally someone will do something that completely shatters that and make me realize my worry were rightim in high school and usually sit alone on a bench in the common area during lunch because i dont have people to eat with and the anxiety kill my appetite anyways so ill just scroll my phone or do homework or whateverone day recently a group of guy i dont even know walked past and one of them said not even quietly some shit like always see that guy sitting there i dont think he ha any friend gesturing over towards me with the way he said it definitely wasnt meant to be sympathetic or pitying even im not too hurt by what he said itself but that it show that some people do notice that im always alone and they dont even feel sympathy about itlike damn that shit wa so brief and they probably dont even care much but it just confirms some fear i have ive had other situation kind of like that tooif youve got some friend cherish that and hold on to them unless they actually mistreat you of course because when youre totally alone it make it so much harder to even work your way back into average social connection,anxiety123,finally built up the courage to attend a school event but i have been sitting for hour because i dont want to be judged for the way i dress they gave u a dress code eastern but i dont think anyone is going to be wearing eastern but im not sure what if they do and what if im the odd one out and all my eastern clothing arent fancy theyre just casual wear because i never fucking go outside   my friend said she wa going for something fancy but not too bulky not too simple and i dont have that all i have are simple clothes all of my anxiety revolves around this every fucking day i think about what people would think im so sick of my brain   and i would have just given up at going but i really want to go like this is the first time im looking forward to something and ugh idk maybe i should just wear whatever i want,anxiety124,just wanted to post here in hope that someone can help me  i have been diagnosed with social anxiety for a long a i can remember and i unfortunately have not received help for it put on med but quit started therapy but quit etc the past year ive done thing that i cant even begin to dream of such a getting a job for the first time and meeting new people but my main obstacle that i still need to get over is driving ive had my permit ever since i wa  but im almost  and i have had no luck in getting the courage to get behind the wheel ive taken driving class  time and my instructor keep telling me that i drive well but i do not trust myself the issue is not vehicle maneuvering it is the number of rule and regulation that must be followed while on the road when driving for example you must be aware of not only what is in front of you but also what is behind you to your left to your right past your blind spot and how everyone else is driving around you most of the time i dont even know where to look it stress me out so much that i need to pay attention to everything plus direction light changing lane merging etc to even drive anywhere ive been in an accident  time already and while majority of them were not my fault i had no idea what i did wrong example some guy hit me while i had the right of way but had no idea what happened until my friend at the passenger seat explained  i feel completely hopeless ive missed out on so many opportunity because i cannot drive myself anywhere i am utterly trapped in my own home and embarrassed that i have to rely on my friend and family for transportation im too afraid to use uber plus it would be costly or to use the bus i long for the freedom to be able to choose what to do and where to go but it a if i were cornered with wall that im unable to climb  what can i do i hope there is at least some hope for me i wa even thinking to push myself and just drive anyway even if i hate it and that itll eventually get easier i did the same with getting a job and in the end it turned out great but i dont think driving can be placed in the same vein and if i do follow through with pushing my boundary i know i wont be able to handle the fear the stress and sheer terror scare me so much but i believe i have no choice  any advice is greatly appreciated i hope that i can overcome this fear and be able to live life the way i want to,anxiety125,it my first time posting on reddit im so sorry for my awkwardness i have a girl bsf f we knew each other since  i think

just want a more diverse group of people i can rely on so that the people i am the closest to do not get bothered but i am simply unable to do that the smallest of action by someone will make me go

everyoneive finally decided to work on my social anxiety issue after avoiding it for year ive come to realise that it been at least  year since ive made a new friend im f and that this is entirely due to my social anxiety to make thing worse i moved abroad from all my old friend a few year ago so when it come to spending time with friend it basically only the occasional video call with my friend in my my home country it been year since ive caught up for a coffee with anyonethe reason i havent pursued new friendship is because at some point over the last few year i developed a fear of talking to new people my social anxiety focus on my fear of other people seeing my physical anxiety symptom often when talking to a new person ill suddenly get really anxious small talk i have no issue with but whenever it feel like it becoming a longer conversation my voice will start to shake my eye fill with tear and i just want to get away from the situation asap it come on so suddenly on time where ive tried to push through the feeling it just made thing  worse for me and it doesnt take long for the person talking to me to suddenly look concerned and ask me whats wrong ive no idea why i react like this since i never had an issue talking to people in my early s in fact i used to love meeting new people now it make me feel physically sick when im going to be in a situation surrounded by new people im just so afraid im going to break down in front of them and it so embarrassing when it happensim tired of living this way and feeling so isolated i want to finally make some new friend ha anyone had this type of anxiety before and overcome it i would love to know what helped you the most thank you,anxiety184,hey everyoneive been dealing with sad for  year and now im at college my life ha never been harder than the  previous year ive been suffering from depression lost all my friend and almost failed my first year of collegebut this year i met an amazing person she make me feel so much better and shes pretty much the only person i can talk to without getting an anxiety attack im not attracted to her romantically but shes definitely the best friend ive ever hadthe thing is she doesnt know i have sad and she doesnt know it but she help me a lot by initiating conversation and by making me feel like a normal human being i just want to thank her for everything she did for me but should i tell her about my social anxiety  is it worth taking the risk of ruining a friendship ,anxiety185,how do i answer question with no experience i feel like if im honest i wont get the job is there anything i could put on my resume to help when applying,anxiety186,i am  year old and definitely have social anxiety i always used to be a funny and outgoing person but after  year lockdown i wa crushed by it went outside and the overwhelming fear got the worst of me feeling that everyone wa watching me and judging me for every step and every breath wa so bad that i started to isolate myself from the world including my family friend then the summer wa spent completely in my home playing video game i got to my dream school but it turned to be the worst nightmare with social anxiety couldnt interact with anyone everyone had made contact with each other but not me i  sat there alone on my phone with fear of others crushing me every second  at the end of that year  i told my family about it guess what they called it b and told me that i am just overthinking not that it a fucking symptom of it but it my fault and i need to get it over with great fucking advice since then symptom after  month of battling with it only decreased the fear by like  a i grew partially numb to any emotion i ever felt but the fear very often intensifies for example  month ago i went on a day school trip with my class abroad it wa supposed to be one of the best experience of my life a i never went abroad before it quickly turned into the worst experience i could have had at some point of my year ongoing social anxiety i began to sweat excessively and it only increased over the time especially on my back it made me even more anxious a i am sitting in the front of the class and feeling like everyone is fucking watching me and laughing at me is destroying me and a fact that my back sweat get through a heavy hoodie and it visible to everyone behind me make me even more anxious and get more sweaty  a neverending loop  back to the school trip  getting out of the bus and see the huge crowd of people made me so anxious that the sweat got through my heavy hoodie it wa cold there that day i didnt take photo of me like i wanted because i felt like everyone will suddenly stop doing what they were doing look at me and laugh at me like im an idiot i hate it my parent asked why i took only a small amount of photo instead of taking picture of everything  i said i forgot i wont tell them that i am scared of people and i cant interact with anyone normally because i tried before and it didnt do shit  i had a lot of chance to have a girlfriend but every time girl noticed my extreme nervousness and just walked away so i just stopped trying because there is no point in that  i noticed over the time more and more trigger to my social anxiety like eating in public place standing in queue ordering food etc  eating in dinner hall in the hotel also during that school trip wa one of the worst experience of my life i walked there  extreme fear and overthinking caused me to not know what i wa supposed to do then a like  people behind me wa waiting for my move i started to do what the person in front me wa doing  for fuck sake i wa literally overthinking every move i did even holding the fucking food grabber even when i didnt like the food the person in front of me wa grabbing i took it a i wa afraid that everyone is going to judge me for what im eating when i finally sat with the food  my hand were shaking when i wa eating a i felt like everyone wa looking at me and judged every move i made i really wanted to stay at the hotel room locked alone so i could finally be myself and feel free but the teacher said that everyone must go down and if not there will be consequence  i cant even normally order food i walk to a store and  of my mind is focused on a belief that everyone is watching and judging me and i begin to get extremely hot so i am left dripping in sweat so i smell bad and get even more anxious about it   i feel like im just gonna wait till im  year old so i can go to a therapy on my own because no one else that i know understands what im going through when even my family doesnt give a flying fuck about it my father call it bullshit my mother ignores it thats really great i skipped a lot of day in school pretending to be sick saying that we dont have anything during that day etc i asked myself numerous time  why me why me the funniest and extroverted person in the previous class had to be the one that developed this shit now i have no friend because of it only school acquaintance and my family even if they dont understand it they are still the most important people to me right nowi really had to get it off my chest so if you actually managed to read all of it i really appreciate it it took me a really long time to get the courage to share my thought here,anxiety187,i dont know if vent post are allowed but i literally have nowhere to say how i feel so whatever but i left the house yesterday for the first time in week to meet with a friend and i actually feel worse than i did before i tried to get myself in the mood beforehand but it honestly just made me hate myself even more because i physically couldnt speak and felt like i couldnt breathe the whole time and all i wanted to do wa break down and cry and then when i got home i just realised how stupid i must have looked and ill probably get blocked soon i wish i wasnt such a disappointment and wa more interesting to be around this always happens to me i dont even know why i continue to try,anxiety188,httpswwwredgifscomwatchmelodicshrillbigmouthbasshttpswwwredgifscomwatchmelodicshrillbigmouthbass,anxiety189,title,anxiety190,i did it  i met a complete stranger and had a conversation all the heart palpitation and twisting and turning in my stomach had been irritating me for a whole week but i am so glad i violated my comfort zone just wanted to share it here ,anxiety191,so last year our instructor planned to meet up with u the apprentice for christmas bowling he mentioned a  euro penalty for the one who dont come which i seriously considered so the day came and i just drove there and a always i passed by the actual location twice navigation isnt my best friend so i parked there and i wa a few minute too late but i saw a coworker when i passed by there i wasat the entrace outsideno one wa there i just wa too afraid to go in there alone and i wa like ah fck this imma pay dat  buck i aint going in there alone  suddenly a coworker called me and asked me where i wa and in that moment my instructor came outside to get me in that damn building xd i had some fun and at some point the mate who called me told me i bet in my mind that you would not come i foud that amusing xd it wa a fun night even though i noticed towards the end that i still lack friendship or just having conversation they even asked me if i had fun they really didnt expect that i would comeah btw my first try wa a strike lol,anxiety192,for example i will have anxiety for hour anticipating a client meeting however i actually believe the meeting will go well and it nothing serious why do i still have this anxiety if i logically know there are no reason to have it and believe everything is gonna be ok,anxiety193,sometimes when im anxious i tend to say thing in a way that offends people or say smth that get understood the wrong way and i usually freak out about it so bad i just said something like that to someone then i realized he mightve understood it wrong or got offended by itcan you reassure me that it fine cuz rn it taking me everything to not explain myself to that person if youre wondering why i dont wanna explain myself it because it make me feel weak and i dont want that any reassurance please,anxiety194,you might think this trite and overused buti dont exist when you dont see mei dont exist when you when youre not here,anxiety195,there a stark contrast between my first semester of school and the second during the first i wa a complete loner and had to almost completely depend on myself for a lot of thing in the second however it still slightly the same it just that i have more option to choose from aside from myselfthe bonding process with my classmate is quite a long story but im happy to say i actually feel safe to approach many others now for not just help with school assignment but also everyday topic to talk about when im boredand that includes my crushits also viceversa im apparently one of if not the number one smartest person in class for one of the module so people gravitate towards me more often than not due to my supposed intellect and this is one of the rarer moment where im certain im not being taken advantage of because we all seem to have had a fair exchange in term of assistance im learning what boundary mean thanks to thisthing is though i wouldnt consider them close friend since they have their own clique to eat with during lunch when i dont there are also some classmate who dont either and considering we dont make a pact to eat with each other still make me regard them a just casual friend but even so all of u who usually remain in class during break would either talk to or play game with one another if we dont have any work to do that alone already make me content with my social life and progress thus farif i were to share a tip with you guy it to trust the socialising process and have the mentality of life being full of trial and error i initially failed to have that mindset but once i did have it ingrained in my head it successfully resulted in whatever i shared above conversing is hard i know that all too well but overtime youd adapt to people personality and instinctively learn to pick up social skill similar to theirs sometimes i cringe at the thought of it but it no different from code switching really it took me a few month to noticesad can never really leave you but that doesnt mean you should choose to succumb to it is what i learnt,anxiety196,like i do this often with my member of family or people iam scared to talk to like my brother for example we are like total stranger and when he came to talk to me i got really insecure and scared to talk to him iam like acting like i dont want to talk or iam asshole on purporose so he will leave me alone than i regret it and beat myself for it like he start to talk to me i give him cold short answer and take out my phone and look at it with my beating heart and wait until he give up and go away for few second i cant act around him socialible and light hearted even when he do and act goofy iam very insecure to show a little of true self and loose thightness and even talk this happens to a lot of people iam intimated by somehow sometimes i try to force myself to talk to him but i dont know what to ask or say and my ming go always blank around people in situation like this how can i fucking help this  doe anybody else do this with people ,anxiety197,in an episode of seinfeld the social outcast and all round loser george costanza decides to consistently do the opposite of what he normally doe and what he want to do instead of ordering a chicken sandwich he order turkey on toast he doe this for a while and stuff start going well for him implying his decision making is so broken that the exact opposite of his desire is much better recently i decided to do this with regard to my social anxiety my friend went out to a club for nye i didnt wanna go so i went im with my friend i wanna stay with them and not be noticed by people so i do the opposite and go a few row back amongst stranger i wanna not dance coz im now

developed a relationship friendly or romantic it too easy for me to feel an attraction to a girl who happens to seem my type in so many way on discord ive gotten to talking to a woman from australia who i find very cute and attractive is also suffering with social anxiety and like to be quarky and make edgy joke like me even i see her acting all cute and even flirty but in a joking way i imagine cause shes taken and online all the way in australia anyway so i know it just her personality unfortunately i find myself feeling really lustful inside when i talk to her of course it not love dont know her long enough for that and never met in person so obviously it just a lust a fantasy feeling the question is should i for mine and her benefit just cut her off that would probably be healthy to do right or should i just work out my own issue and keep socializing in hope i can learn to see her a an online friend to chat with nothing more,anxiety199,hi guy i dont know this is really happening to you guy and not me too i love friday and saturday but i heard some people get sunday scaries on saturday evening i dont know why they get in on a saturday evening is it because when you fall asleep the next thing youll see is the dreadful sad quiet anxious dead horror day i think it might happen before you finish your spring summer autumn and winter break when it your last day for your break youll remember you were in heaven with angel and god around you but once you end the day you think it the beginning of hell how should i be confident on going to school again  this doesnt really happen at the age of  to  because your still not mature enough to think about these stuff because my  year old birthday landed on a monday plus it wa the day where we had to go back to school after a huge break not nervous or dead that time instead my last day of  year old me and my mother went to our friend house swam at the swimming pool took a bath and had dinner at my mother friend house and came back home and watched one doraemon movie before i ended  year old i remember it wa the museum movie where nobita and his friend had to go look for doraemons property well it felt like a friday or a saturday that time but once you grow at age like   to  youll see the dread before your break endsampxbways to solve this best methodampxb stay up late on saturday i know staying up late is not good doing it always unless you cant sleep or something but since it your last chance to enjoy why not staying up a bit late like between  to  in the midnight and get up at around  to  to start your day fresh so you can go to bed early at sunday evening it could be a hard thing to wake up at  to  after you slept that late but you can lay down watch funny video or movie before you have your first meal or you guy call it breakfast some kid are motivated in their height and want to be taller they think sleeping late wont make you taller that theory is not completely true you do get taller even when you sleep late when you be lazy all day like lay down in bed the whole day not eating or not moving even a step from your bed whole day that will not going to make you taller at all dont think i gotta go sleep early on a saturday evening too because your wasting your last chance i heard there wa a kid who wa exercising regularly but slept so late like weekday like  and weekend like  to  in the midnight one whole year he still gained cm in height in a year well at least youll gain cm when you sleep late the whole year people who sometimes sleep early sometimes sleep late will grow a bit quicker than these people so dont waste your time enjoy your saturday and sunday and throw all the worry and dread to sunday evening and go to bed a early a possible dont forget to do your homework or other stuff before you go to bed you will have a bad day check what you need for school and prepare it dont get yourself down monday are hell but friday are heaven if you had a good friday you will have another friday if you go to bed early like  make you reach from monday to friday in a second,anxiety200,im very witty expressive and interesting in online conversation whether it

matter followed with guilttripping i just left that garbage on read let them be mad it okay i would have never done that before i would have apologized and compromised a much a possible just to keep

at the same time i cant everyday is the same work home work home wish my life wa more exciting and i had people to enjoy life with in reality i wish i had friend i just lie to myself and say im fine

to lie all the time and pretend im someone im not in hope that ill be noticed and seen a a good person to be friend with but i dont even know who i am anymore i cant remember the last time i wa genuinely happy and relaxed what did i do to deserve this,anxiety255,id be going by myself i feel okay with going and working out but what i struggle really hard with is feeling judged and looked at

friend no job i just got fired for missing work without calling in did not feel like explaining my depression so i did the delay and ignore thing i do until the decision is made for me my family

pitying me i have been just about to graduate with a pretty bad gpa after five year my dream wa to go to medical school but thats looking increasingly unlikely ive tried pretty much everything in my power all my resource and everything i have learned and nothing ha worked the only hope i have is you can never do too much there always day i didnt try or ignored and maybe if i didnt i be better maybe one day ill be perfect until i get better all this what im most afraid of is one day it probably will be too late to make a change like one day it will actually be too late for me to make friend or meet a partner or get a full filling job really aiming high  and it wont just be the fear but reality that brings me down,anxiety257,have been seeing this girl and have seen her like  time now weve been round each others house a few time which i find comfortable but the only time weve actually been out the house have involved drinking or ive taken a benzodiazepine before so wa manageable and came across a confident which is not what i really wanted to do a it feel like false advertising and i know this is a temporary not permanent solution but i wa in to her and didnt want to fuck it up im going round hers tomorrow and thinking it probably a good time to mention that i struggle with it a i no longer want to have to mask it with having a drink or benzo and shes talking about doing all these thing like meeting her family and friend and it make me die a little inside a ive been through a bit of a bad patch recently and there no way i feel i could do that sober at the moment my next question is how should i bring it up im worried this is going to be a complete turnoff and she no longer want to see me but id rather that than die in a social situation i find too challenging and uncomfortable at the moment ive even thought about taking the easy way out and saying i dont want to see her anymore but the reality is i do im just so anxious and depressed and feel like ive got nothing interesting to say when sober thanks,anxiety258,i am not sure if it belongs here but i have noticed that my social anxiety is significantly lower when speaking to people much older than me

still smell it and thought i wa still spraying the disinfectant to be funny despite my crippling social anxiety i can be very playful and at time unintentionally annoying due to my lack of social skill i didnt notice that my bos had even momentarily exited the work area possibly to escape the fume even though i thought i wa far enough for her not to smell it when i wa done spraying i heard another coworker say something about it and i went to her and pointed the spray can at her to be funny so i guess that made them think i had continued to spray the disinfectant to be funny then my other coworker with the asthmatic relative snapped at me i guess because she thought i wa spraying the stuff to be funny i tried to tell her that i wa trying to spray my thing down and had gone to the other side of our work area to do iti feel really embarrassed and im going back into my everybody secretly hate me mindset again my household wa pretty violent and there wa a lot of yelling there

a couple drink and we ordered pizza and just chilled it wa amazing it wa the first time i had a friend over in my apartment it been a couple day and weve texted since then but a part of me want to text him and thank him for hanging out and to let him know he always welcome but i dunno if it too much or too pushy  or if it self explanatory weve been friend for a couple week only so it still pretty early and i dont want him to get the wrong idea or maybe even be scared off by me being too intense i have to keep in mind that people have friend already and a newcommer might not be introduced to the whole group any advice anyone can give me would be greatly appreciated,anxiety293,so let me explain i wa just chilling alone in a game and someone who i dont know come up to me and

voice and i have a speech impediment so i stutter alot and have trouble pronouncing some thingsthey liked me so they friend me and i accept it they said want to play tomorrow but i really dont theyre

through every possible meaning of whats already been said and every possible response before deciding what to sayon top of that i get a sort of decision paralysis when trying to be the one that hold a conversation and trying to small talk there are so many thing i could talk about i get stuck just pickingive thought ive had sa for almost  year now but joined this subreddit today and im not so sure anymore,anxiety295,i developed social anxiety because i am an ugly woman i am an introvert but i do want to socialise but i am deterred because most of the time people respond to me negatively

hollowness which make me look special i have sleep issue so i always look tired and lack of quality sleep cause me to behave more awkwardly because i get confused easily people are uncomfortable

nothing interesting to say to some random person i could rack my brain for hour and come up with nothing overall it wa really depressing watching all these other people being super wild and carefree

i could just be normali bummed a cigarette off this girl outside a bar and we actually had a decent conversation but then her boyfriend showed up and started like hugging her and making out with her

able to pic a pose lol anyways yea my heart wa racing when i asked for her permission the reason why i went for it wa because ive been in this situation before where i see someone that id love to take

but it made me feel something u know glad i did that,anxiety301,tbh i only overtip for two reason i want the person to be happy and my social anxiety tell me to like for example i wa at a subway the

the attractive girl lean over to point out the soccer jersey im wearing and we start talking about the sport for a little the next  visit she is the one checking me in and i start up the conversation bc i enjoyed talking to her it go well and i tell my friend about how cool it wa it also seems to be a natural desire to ask for her number the next visit i wanted to but wa panicking and didnt even try a little today i missed my appointment but wanted to force myself to still go to try to ask for it i walked in and she wa the only one up front so i walked into the bathroom and said that this wa the universe way of telling me to go for it no opportunity could be a perfect a this let me quickly mention that ive never asked for or even hit on a stranger in person sobber in my life m so i come out the bathroom and start up the convo and tell he reven though i missed my appointment i also wanted to ask her for her number my whole body did a collective cringe and she said my number and i said yeah awkwardly that wa where she responded i think that would be unprofessional to do that i wa confused about that even being unprofessional but quickly realized that she wa kindly saying no honestly i wa shocked because she truly seemed interested in me when we spoke so now ive learned that hitting on stranger is a total fluke and there is no chance at all that i will even be doing that again my

early fall which all went very well imo he expressed interest amp we had great chemistry in person we both had very busy schedule so we mutually decided to hold off on seeing each other till after the holiday i dont know what the hell happened the other night w ago actually but i had an anxiety attack after seeing that hed changed his tinder bio which he hasnt done since we started talking it not something i check often only a couple time out of insecurity i then composed a long winded message about how i wa sorry for not texting him often amp that i wa sorry for a sarcastic joke he didnt quite get it wa stupid amp i knew i shouldnt have sent it  cringing at myself amp cry rn i also said that id wanted to talk but i knew he wa busy so i wanted to give him space etc it wa so redundant considering wed already spoken about how wed both be distant for a little while in my mind i wa worried i hadnt showed enough interest amp thought i wa going to lose the opportunity after seeing him active on tinder we never talked about being exclusive so he doesnt owe me that it just stung to see at the end of my text i suggested that we catch up by going to a climbing gym bc thats something were both interested ini typed the message out late at night but sent it midaft the next day without reading too much over it or thinking it through thoroughly i feel so embarrassed now bc he took a couple day to respond amp basically seemed confused a to why i would even apologize or send the message at all that wa what i got from his response at least he also said he would be down to go which i cant confirm wa a yes my response to this wa another longish message thanking him for understanding amp adding that i had some social anxiety amp that it helped to clarify it been a week since my second message and i feel like i fucked it all up i dont know if it would be appropriate to message him again because i dont always read social cue perfectly i wish i could go back and not send the initial message i dont have friend to turn to because ive pushed them away out of fear anxiety amp impostor syndrome which is why im here in hope to get this off my chestfeeling like a loser

to do a tv production class next semester because  i thought i wa interesting and  i wanted to be forced to interact with people more since it a very social class ie lot of group work i dont think i can do it anymore though ending up alone made me so sad and i dont think i deal with it for a whole semester if that happens and with my luck it probably wouldteacher even let there be a group of  it wa supposed to be group of  since some kid wanted to work with his friend real bad and im alone and it suck because he wa actually at my table since there wa no space and he even clarified he wasnt working with me and he wanted to work with his friend i just want to cry i dont want to do the group project by myself and i certainly dont want to present myself i wa actually okay with the idea of presenting since for my science class i had to but the time i did for science i wa actually in a group and not alone second wa actual solo work so it fine to be alone there i just feel really embarrassed about it in all honesty im the only person alone it wouldnt be so bad if we didnt have to present it would still be bad obviously but not a badim going to end up just skipping class because i cant do it ive been trying so hard to make friend and get out my comfort zone but it doesnt work i really really wanted to do the tv production class but i dont think i can anymore it hurt

to talk to people today we had a group project in my english class and for some reason no one wanted to work with me i ended up being the only one left alone and now i have to do the presentation by myself i wa considering taking a tv production class next semester because i thought it would be interesting and i would be forced to interact with more people but now im not sure i can handle it because it painful and embarrassing to be left alone like this i feel like no matter what i do i cant make any progress in making friend,anxiety320,i had the cinema booked for tomorrow for the first

thing at the minute where i to go to a bar by myself and if i canto try to initiate some sort of interaction with one person at least my previous two post were pretty positive in this instance it wa third time unluckyi went to a bar that wa not in the city this time i wa hopeful there would be live music a saw something online mentioning this however when i arrived there wa no music but there wa at least sport on television i sat at the bar  there wa nobody actually sat there  everyone wa sat at table across from the bar or elsewhere when i wa watching the match there were people ordering drink from in front of where i wa so it wa awkward to say the least when im looking directly past them a they were standing waiting for their drink i walked to the toilet to get an idea wa there anyone alone where could sit near to try to speak to i saw some guy at a table who wa probably near my age  but it could have been the case he wa with others and they just went out it just felt awkward a i would have had to sit at same table and if he didnt want to talk i would have been stuck in a weird situation  anyway i went back to where i wa and i saw some guy sitting by himself nearer the television i wa watching so made my way over and sat at a table next to where he wa it transpired that he wa with others he knew and made his way over to them when tell called him after a short while  but there wa some other older guy sitting near where he wa also so it wa left with myself and him when the match finished i asked the guy something like do you know is there live music here tonight he gave a bare minimum response i then asked if he knew is there ever music on here he just gave another bare minimum response saying that he just come to watch the sport and he didnt know anyway i left after that a wa going anyway since the match wa over  before i left i asked one of the bar staff about the live music and found the answer maybe going forward i should bare that in mind to be open to speaking to bar staff because others can see this and can show i am open to speaking to others and    it is good in and of itself a practice interacting with othersthat venue tonight wasnt great compared to previous two imo a most people were at table  the other two occasion there were people at the bar meaning i wouldnt have to go over and sit at a table to talk to people but rather could just naturally say something while standing or queuing at bar or even could say something in between song a there wa also live music to enjoyanyway it a bit more practice doing something alone at least  my takeaway is choose my venue more wisely next time,anxiety325,removed,anxiety326,im in my third year of university and i havent made a single friend yet im literally always by

dont i can already imagine exactly how it will go depression alcoholism no friend never leaving my room and probably cry everydayuniversity is my last chance at living life ok maybe thats a bit dramatic but itll be the last place where im in an environment where i can easily make friend and build a social life right now i have no friend the few i had moved away for university whilst i took a gap year ive probably hit rock bottom with my social anxiety during my gap year since i rarely leave the house i havent had a reason to since i do everything from my room work study exercise etci have  month to improve ive moved to a shit ton of school during my life and every time i start a new school im convinced i will be a completely different person and actually make friend but i quickly realised no matter where i go my social anxiety will always follow me unless i actually try to make a change nothing will happen magically ive never tried to actively improve my social anxiety all ive done is try to fake confidence so my question is where do is start what are actual thing i can do that can significantly improve my anxiety in your own experience also is there a way to actually get rid of it at least to the point where it not considered a disorder any advice would be appreciated alotlt,anxiety344,i have a fan page for an actor i like it fun i can be silly and weird with other fan and ob over him with friend but then i made a pretty decent piece of fan art and one of the show producer started following me she look at all my story and i assume she also see my post but never like anything it make me really selfconscious because i feel like shes expecting me to make more great fan art of the show when that wa just kind of a onetime deal the show she produce is actually one of my least favorite thing this dude ha been in so i feel guilty for barely posting about it a i prefer his other show also she know him personally sigh and i also think she might be a lesbian so i always imagine that she is silently judging me for obsessing over this guy in the first place i want to be a dignified and noble fan page and never act cringe or thirsty lol but sometimes i cant always be she doesnt really follow any other fan page just me so i feel that i have to be a representative of how fan feel about her show and the actor and i am failing miserably at representing u because my account is small and weird if she followed any of the larger account or the account dedicated to the show not the actor she would find them a lot more normal and a better representation of the fandom at large,anxiety345,like i get that these guy have no clue who i am nor will probably ever see me again after like  minute but whenever i mess up i have huge anxiety vc doesnt help at all

made me unconfortable or awkward and weirdly they actually understood what i meant and defended me but outsider of my group friend of them were not a good thing they got me really worse and wanting to

me a going beyond that and showing more specific social anxiety behavior or more explicitly showing itthe anime in question which i recommend watching if youre interested are bocchi the rock  hitoribocchi no marumaruseikatsu funnily enough both protagonist are both named bocchi despite the two series having nothing to do with each otherwhile bocchi the rock also regularly exaggerates withdrawing and spacing out behavior for comedic effect it also ha genuine troubledcharacter scene the most memorable scene for me is gther being unable to enter the place where they planned to meet up trying to pump herself up and overcome the anxiety blockadelt overall aside from the ontopic social anxiety the series ha great music too and is a nice comedyhitori bocchi is a comedy too the most memorable scene to me is her gtwanting to leave home for school seeing people in front of the house talking and going back in being troubled by having to probably greet them when passing them practicing just that to herself and then going out where they by now have already have leftlthave you watched either of the twodo you know other good series or movie not necessarily anime that have

people sneakily holding their phone or straight up asshole yelling in people face because of their race im already bad with confrontation and being outside but id hate for this to happen id hate for someone to think what i wa doing wa funny or wholesome then posting it on the internet against my knowledge even if it get positive feedback id still hate it and would want to disappear because thats going to stay up there for forever i wish there were more rule or something i dont want to go outside because there camera everywhere and any single person could one day decide to share the recording to the internet even if im not the main focus i could be in the background people cant convince me otherwise because i know it fact ive seen disgusting human on the internet making fun of others for simply going about their day maybe they got unlucky and tripped thats k comment of people laughing at them and k view or some shit or some people will record stranger with their dog and then random comment will want them to track down that stranger to get update or more information why youre giving away that stranger location and privacy thats so rude and depressing i cant find a way to convince myself that going outside is even safe if every action i do is a risk i cant ask people to take down the photo or video i cant ask them to stop recording or taking photo i cant even hope that there a legal system to protect my privacy because even if the person is out in public people are able to figure out the exact street that person is on some people dont even blur out the license plate make no sense that there not some level of protection and i know the law are related to art but i dont care if you want a human model then pay for one or have a contract set up for one because then that allows this whole mess i see no reason for photosvideos unless there consent from both party or for legal reason like the person is harming you and you can prove it and that video should be reserved

photography one girl wa responsible for taking the photo while the rest of u worked on something else concerning the project when the photo were taken the four of u surrounded her and tbh stood too close leaving her just enough room to turn to each of u while she wa trying to bring up the photo on her phone she started making these really odd sound which thinking back wa probably a result of anxiety one of the girl told her to just show u the photo she turned to me first and showed me the picture i then backed off a it wa clear she didnt like being in that position the other three girl stayed gathered around her  so do you think we were being jerk to her and is an apology warranted,anxiety406,i have a strong fear of being seen alone probably due to the my school culture where people will gossip about those who sitseats alone saying stuff like they are a loser and loner and have no friend etc it kinda toxic tbh and now that in school everyone is in their clique i get very paranoid and fearful that i am getting judged and gossiped about when i am not with my friend due to the timetable i am also super anxious that nobody want to partner with my for project and everyone will see me a the loser and loner any advice please,anxiety407,recently moved to a new school the first day i wa really anxious and nervous and shaking vigorously all tho  i did have a friend who

and they dont stress me out and im willing to talk to them and spend time with them this opposes the people i attend school with they arent the issue theyre okay people but i feel my breath being taken away from me with their presence it like if they were just an acquaintance that we meet casually one day i would be glad to salute them but if theyre in my class ill avoid the sight of them i

specifically,anxiety415,okay so tonight i didnt have other thing lined up so i said id try to go to a bar again a have tried this recently i drove into the city and when i wa parked around the corner i started feeling a little bit apprehensive i think in the back of my mind i wa worried about the prospect of being in this bar by myself and looking really conspicuous a i sat in my car i wa looking at my phone and saw a video suggested on youtube which wa a guy talking about just going out and trying to do thing alone i watched thatthen listened to some musicthen got out of the car and went for a short walk to give myself a little bit of time to work myself up to it the one thing that helped me wa i had the mindset that i wa only going to go in and have a quick drink and go and anything else would have been a bonus  i only had to go for few min this helped push me forward with my plan to go in that wa a good tip i saw online before so if you ever feel like you are going to back out of a plan in future just recalibrate your target and see if that help maybe it will or maybe it wont but it did help me tonight the pub wa quite busy and there wa live music a i expected there would be a space opened up at the bar for me where i could sit then some guy who wa on holiday wa there by himself came over to talk  so i ended up talking to him i felt anxious at time but got through it and he seemed to be a nice guy am not sure how long i wa there but could easily have been  min talking so my plan wa only to go in and get comfortable being alone watching the music but i ended up getting good practice socialising in another thing i will say ishad i have not taken the chance of stepping out of my comfort zone there would have been one le person there alone which make it harder for people who decide to go alone youre giving yourself a chance of people talking to you a it is easier for people to approach someone who alone than someone who is with a group i did get lucky tonight the way thing fell into place for me  maybe there is someone looking down on me from above helping out,anxiety416,ive been sitting in the house alone for the last  year because of my

initially nervous about it because in my last group project my partner were talking behind my back because i wa too quiet which i found out from a classmate telling me but this time i wa determined to make a good impression and actually cracked some joke and made small talk this sound crazy but i never make small talk or express myself through humor im afraid of being seen a unfunny or a tryhard it helped that one of my partner seemed just a socially anxious a mefueled by the adrenaline rush from the compliment i went up to and talked to the classmate that i ran into yesterday it wa super awkward but im glad i actually had the courage lol she asked me to join track and field i want to but doing a sport sound like hell for my social anxietywhat would i have done differentlyokay so this is a bad habit but i tend to hover around a lot when trying to start talking to someone it took me  minute of awkwardly walking behind the girl with pink hair before i tapped her on the shoulder and gave the compliment if i could redo that i would not think about it and just go for it overthinking fuel anxiety next time ill count to  and just do it tomorrow objective start a conversation with someone ive never talked to,anxiety425,this post is for one specific personampxb,anxiety426,it been a while honestly for me while ive sorted my head out i just didnt wanna be a

likeable isolating yourself because you think you arent interesting or likeable is putting the cart before the horseive noticed a couple post where people worry that they are not interesting or likeable that they dont know what to talk about well let me share the realisation i had social situation are where we build ourselves up and overcome these problem we try tell ourselves we are unworthy of social contact and so we end up with a selffulfilling prophecy that kill u slowlyit is quite hard to be interesting alone you will get more interesting story and build bond by actually doing stuff having even just one person to do thing with mean they can come up with more idea than you alone you can try do thing solo but it isnt the same most of the timeand of course when you do these thing you have story to tell and experience to share people guess what you are more likeable also the experience you have can help strengthen your character again more likablei learned all this breaking out my shell a bit i realized how badly i fucked myself with the selffulfilling prophecy above i realized how backwards i had it it a shitty rich get richer thing in a way but all you can do is build a much a you can starting a soon a possiblei think with social anxiety we get ahead of ourselves and thats why we give up a lot we see we arent like the other people going to barshanging out at each others house and we try to jump straight into those situation sometimes in life you have to start with thing patronizingly small and simple especially when you have limitation like ourssmall

a good time but the whole time she is incredibly quiet and doesnt look comfortable sometimes she will be far away from the group in her own corner and not really converse with the rest of u or hide behind me it can be really hard to find thing to talk to her about during these time because she doesnt have much going on in her life right now besides work i want to be excited for her but she

then shouted at u and threw his marker at my groupmate he shouted at u and instructed u to leave the classroom and so we did i felt really embarrassed  after that incident i always felt anxious about interacting with my classmate who saw the incident like here at home i would have random flashback to that day and feel embarrassed all over again and i would always think that my classmate would be reminded of the incident every time they talk to me or even just see me i could imagine them looking at me and just thinking oh this wa the guy who wa scolded at to leave the classroomits just awful i just want to know how to be better at managing these thought i understand that we completely misbehaved in the situation so i dont really want any advice on that that friend of mine and i always laugh

thinking about this since im learning how to do so for my business and im essentially being tutored and critiqued so i thought id share what ive learned so far for anyone who is curious be very concise what doe that mean well when or i guess in here if you are in a conversation be very direct in what you intend on saying it hard when youre not used to talking but you can practice in your room by yourself trying to articulate your thought in the most concise way possible the fewer word the better butter them up dont confuse this with love bombing you can always give people subtle compliment it will make them feel good and in turn build a better connection with you example are such a i like your glass they really suit you if they tell you about a long day theyve had tell them how theyre one of the hardest working people you know people really appreciate being validated make them feel heard this tie in with the second point if you notice the little thing about them like a haircut or a newly dyed hair any jewelry new clothes give them a compliment about it remember thing about their last conversation and bring it up people like being heard and remembered this is one of the way to live in the present dont be afraid to laugh at yourself many time i see on this sub people telling story about how theyve done something embarrassing dont shy away from it make it something

time in retail i get to and from work by bus and am at work for around nine to ten hour a day every time a customer just look at me weird or disturbs my work i get agitated and i can hardly hide it so now it a running gag with my colleague that im always in a bad mood it the same whenever i go out on a free day lot of people make me anxious and stressed and i cant wait until i get home again it wa never this bad so i also thought about quitting a few time now but im scared because  i dont want to impress new people and maybe suck at the new job and  i cant afford to be even a month late on

draining and exhausting for me the fact that i feel i have nothing to say is also depressing to me i havent really heard others articulate this particular struggle on here and i wa wondering doe

think about commiting suicidemy parent dont know much about my sa i guess even if i explain to them they wont get it so now i really dont wanna go to college everydays like hell i have a feeling that if i do not go out often my anxiety wont be that worse cuz ive experienced that in lockdownmy parent say that home schooling isnt worth it in tamilnadu  india so i feel like suicide is the only way out it weighing me so much,anxiety469,i really need tip,anxiety470,i tend to live in my inner world more than the outter in fact my job is perfect for an introverted a i work for ours on my wacom listening to podcast i can even do home office but even chatting with people in the office a bit a day feel goodthe only downside of the job is that we a a team have meeting regularly where we have to speak while the others listen and it mostly related to personal stuff like how your weekend wa and that happens every weekwhen it my turn i freak out my nerve go crazy and cannot control my voice i tremble it been a year now and i thought these meeting would help me overcome social anxiety public speaking but at some point it wa too much and did the opposite effect i feel more afraid of doing it than beforethen my thought now are speaking these personal stuff is basic is required and the others do it easily and for me is a world then should i try to avoid them or keep facing them despite the anxiety in case not should i talk to my superior and explain this no matter how weird it sound will they think of me a unprofessional or incapable putting a limit to this feel like a step back in my development will i be able to cope with that feeling will i feel a failurejust want to make clear these meeting are mostly part of the social spirit of the company for the sake of growing a community in the office the performance of my job is not affected by the result of these meetingsyour thought your experience anything you want to share is highly appreciated thanks,anxiety471,i live in a place where i dont have car i bought my christmas tree at the corner of where i live what i didnt know is that i would have to walk around the city with it for  minute to dispose of it properly in my home land there is a christmas tree pick up on specific day but apparently where i live now  i need to deliver it myself to a recycling station and i care too much to just leave it there id rather have it being recycled and transformed into something else that mean i do have to walk around the city for  minute with a christmas tree and it give me major anxiety i am so scared ill end up a the star  on someone instagram story i have been procrastinating the task but i decided that today is the day a lot of my therapy discussion have been on rationality and perspective change and so i think it more rational or at least socially acceptable to see someone walking around with a christmas tree right after the holiday rather than in march or april therefore i need to get myself out there and do it even though my whole self just want to stay home alone safely wrapped in a blanket wish me luck ,anxiety472,i texted most of my life but i cant just text forever id like to move to the next step voice chat i find voice chat stressful so id like to get past this be able to talk normally since i miss out on a lot of stuff in life because of this about me im m from romania a few of my interest philosophy psychology movie game design if youre into game wed have something to talk about i play minecraft counterstrike  team fortress  what can run on my pc but open to others be  i live with my family so a bit difficult and if youre from u we may have trouble with timezones so maybe someone from europe my voice is pretty high too probably the cause of my anxiety so let me know if youre interested,anxiety473,whenever i go out in public ie shopping centre restaurant bar etc i get stared at for about  second by most people ive noticed that when im with a bunch of friend im the only one who get stared at for long period of time and people take double take at me i get approached and hit on by guy quite a lot and my girl friend tell me im pretty am i genuinely attractive because i get stared at a lot by both male and femalesi must admit i dress well and put effort into my appearance doe this all mean that when i had self confidence issue about my appearance it wa all just in my head and maybe i am really attractiveps promise this isnt a post fishing for compliment lolthoughts,anxiety474,ive been thinking since i started uni that i might want to study abroaddo student exchange but it wa always ill do that later and now it is lateri can barely function where i live and at my current uni i made some friend in my first year through someone i knew from high school but they moved the following year and ive been a complete loner ever since i rarely talk to people and ive never hung out with people outside of uni or have their social medium etc i feel like i have this idealised view of exchange i go there instantly fall in love with the city make lifelong friend do well with my class and then decide i want to move there permanently ive always wanted to move somewhere with a cooler climate and live happily ever after but i dont like party i dont drink i have terrible social anxiety and im worried about the cost a well im not sure ill enjoy myselfdoes anyone have experience studying abroadbeing an exchange student,anxiety475,i f feel guilty for being this way but i am completely  myself when im alone and i feel bad because i wish i could be myself with other people even with my family i cant be myself the only person i can is with my sister i know it sound stupid but i notice i cuss le when im in front of family and stranger but when im by myself i have a sailor mouth it sound so fucking stupid honestly idk if anyone else can relate or maybe it just me idk if this mean im shy or just quiet in front of them,anxiety476,hi everybody i am currently  month past due for my car inspection sticker the sole reason pretty much being my social anxiety im horrible with making phone call appointment or doing walk in im so anxious about going to get it done which happens every year but im embarrassed to tell anyone in my life in fear of being perceived a lazy or unmotivated it also brings me anxiety to drive around with an expired sticker so i really do want to get it over with im just dreading it i guess im here to ask for some word of wisdom or some motivation for a little push to go get it done,anxiety477,i wa really shy a a kid but when i moved to canada a lot of that shyness went away and i became way more confident to go up to people and ask if i can sit next to them or ask them a question i feel like now that shyness ha turned into social anxiety tho because while im not worried about that first interaction i worry about the thing that follow that figuring out whether people actually want to be friend with me or if they just talk to me because they feel bad if they think im annoying etcampxbi recently started college and became friend with a group of people that are really nice and friendly but theyre all so outgoing and i feel weird that i dont know how to be like that by outgoing i mean simple stuff like they casually high five people or dont feel weird laughing out loud or even knowing how to reply to a little joke i know this might sound dumb but i always feel so awkward doing thing like these and i know the biggest advice might be to just be myself but i think i would be much better in every aspect of my life if i learned how to just be like other outgoing people are,anxiety478,during my first semester of school i tried to put myself out there and hopefully make some new friend but to no avail more specifically there is a person in one of my class that i tried to befriend but i guess they just arent very interested and moved on i talked to this person for a while because we sat close to each other we would joke around and they would tease me a bit in fact they approached me first and we sort of went from there i got this person contact info and we talked briefly after school from time to time i wouldnt talk to them everyday out of fear of being too nagging or annoying so i just gave them some space and kind of worked around them naturally eventually i asked them if they were busy on the weekend i got no response for a week and when they did respond they didnt answer my question and they sent me an image of something completely unrelated that experience wa what really discouraged me and made me reflect on myself most people dont get the vibe that im uncomfortable or have no confidence in myself because i like to joke around a lot but im really terrified of talking to people that i think in my head are better than me more accomplished or just generally likable because i feel like there no competing socially when theyre around ive been trying to stick with some friend or just find a place where i just fit for most of my life but people either just stop talking to me overtime or just end up ignoring me and not really caring about staying in touch or hanging out outside of school i can recall another instance a few year ago with a former childhood friend this guy and i did just about everything together we usually ended up with the same teacher same class and the same friend our parent knew each other and he even invited me to his birthday and everything we grew up and he sort of drifted into a different crowd i reached out to him once no answer and that wa it he look at me in the hall sometimes but to this day we havent spoken a word to each other in about four year i guess that just happens when you grow up but it still make me sad because i thought he wa my only good friend for the longest time and thats when i started to become a background character i know people and i have a few friend but they still feel distant i had three friend last year and we had a lot of class together but one of them moved away and i eventually cut her off for something horrible she did that made me very upset and now i only have one class with one of them and two class with the other and i only sit next to one of them in one class period so we dont even get to talk that much i try to initiate thing on the weekend but she always ha an excuse and ditch me or tell me that shes busy and then the next day ill see picture of her with her friend at a concert or shopping i feel like there no point in having meaningful interaction with people anymore and that ill just be the outsider with no real friend for the rest of my life is it just my mindset is this just my fate am i not trying hard enough am i trying too hard am i thinking too hardi can answer question and provide more context if neededgrammar,anxiety479,hi im f looking for female friend in toronto or anywhere in gta area that would like to do friendship thing i really like

early without insinuating it because of him even though it is he take advantage of my social anxiety and know i wont confront him so i feel like at this point ive got to say something or just dip,anxiety488,i know this is true in the right situation talking to someone i can get along with my social skill are there theyve felt trampled on at time theyre not great around family but overall they arent bad really maybe yours are better than you think but can seem worse due to being anxious if there is someone you are comfortable with then your social skill may be just fine i dunno just seeing average interaction between people not everyone is smooth there lot of clumsiness,anxiety489,presentation speaking in class making friend everything just make me feel so physically and mentally sick it not even just social anxiety but anxiety in general ive started to realize that when im shivering because it cold it actually because of the fatigue i get from anxiety i cant fucking speak up in class without my voice shaking and god dont even get me started on presentation then there the whole tell your teacher about it and see if you can sit out on that stuff but i also get anxiety even thinking about telling my teachersi really do hate sitting alone at lunch but it not like i can randomly go up to someone and be like hey can i sit with you when everyone already ha their established clique and i get overwhelmed with thinking about all the bad thing that could happen and embarrass myself being alone in class is fine since im focused on my work but at lunch amidst all the lunch table i feel like everyones watching me and it make me want to throw up when i realize there are people that know me friend who im not a close to or people from middleelementary school who could see me sitting alone,anxiety490,no matter what im doing if it in public especially at school my mind is attacked from all side by anxious thought of what people think of me and what im doing theyre inescapable it doesnt get any better even the slightest movement are all judged by my inner thought making me noticeably choppy and not smooth with my movementsdecisions like normal people in class ill switch between  different way of resting my head on my hand when i sit in the back of the class it no issue because im just a fly on the wall i hate it i feel like a bitch when i walk down the hallway because my thought tell me i look soft and that im weak because i have these thought im like a reverse narcissist who cant stop thinking about themself but all the thought are self deprecating this is part of the reason i took up fighting is to prove to myself im not weak i am not suicidal and do not do self harm i hate being weakened by this illness im open to help,anxiety491,ive been suffering with social anxiety since a far back a kindergarten ive been with many therapist and have been on and off of med since  my anxiety make me feel like i have a stomach virus side affect being nausea i always feel on the edge of throwing up and shitting myself ive never thrown up from my anxiety but it doe cause sever diarrhea which cause me to be trapped in the bathroom im now  m i just graduated high school this past summer and am currently unemployed living with my mother i really need a job but get sick to my stomach just thinking about it im really afraid of how my anxiety will react in a work environment fyi i did cyber school on and off since middle school because i felt constantly sick in class im afraid a work environment will be the same situation causing me from progressing any further in life doe anyone have any advice,anxiety492,for the past  year ive slowly been trying to improve my social skill and lessen my social anxiety by putting myself out there more i thought starting high school would actually increase my chance of making friend and meeting people who i actually can connect well with and share similar interest with the problem with me is that i dont always make the best first impression and even if i am somewhat better at talking to people now than i wa before people still are quick to judge and quick to criticize when i try to contribute to conversation half the time i am either unheard or ignored the few time i have found someone i thought i had connected well with i would get so attached to them and they would drift away because i dont want to come off a too annoying or clingy but then i wonder sometimes if me not reaching out is what cause them to lose interest i mean every single friendship i have ever had wa short lived and i cant seem to figure out what im doing wrong ive been told before by people who used to be my friend either that i dont talk enough and that i come off a dry at time im still working on myself but somehow i feel like despite the constant gradual exposure plus increased amount of effort to keep relationship alive im getting nowhere i know i shouldnt have high standard or expectation considering the fact that i still lack social skill and id be lucky to have anyone even have patience with me at all but all the different approach im taking are getting me nowhere and im starting to lost hope the idea of someone liking me enough to stay in spite of my social flaw just seems unrealistic for me which suck because i want to be around people when im alone and i hate being by myself but then again the moment im around them again i manage to hate myself even more im so exhausted ive done exposure online therapy i dont want be on medication to ease my anxiety and frustration when im already taking medication for other health issue at the moment at this point im just trying to convince myself that i might always be alone and that there no use hoping even though i know that im lying to myself whenever i try to accept it,anxiety493,removed,anxiety494,my anxiety got worse when i came back from my native country during vacation the first day wa hell and i saw new familiar place from my middle school they were my previous bully and i almost had a panic attack i made eye contact with them btw these are my middle school bully notelementary when i wa a new immigrant coming back from my country made me so sad and i wa truly happy there i cried in the airplane too bc i knew what wa coming for me in the future and seeing all the people around me laughing having  fun the first day the teacher being so enthusiastic and specially my bully it triggered it all for me i panicked cried went to the office and felt miserable i wa so happy in my other country and now i wa back to this hell reality my nosebleed began to worsen due to stress and the school noticed they know im anxious already i couldnt stay in class and the office lady told me my daughter had anxiety youll get better that honestly did it for me i hated her but now i hate her more later i heard her tell my mom if she doesnt get better shell be like this through college it made me mad but maybe it true i then got horrible migraine had panic attack and left school after that i didnt go back to school and i wa hopeless my mom contacted my pediatrician psychologist and psychiatrist i remember before i left my spanish teacher asked me youre scared of starting again right i just said yes she asked me what do i do to treat my anxiety and i kinda just have her a list of pill escitalopram every day lorazepam for panic attack mirtazapine to sleep she wa shocked im in a private school im and honor and scholarship and immigrant student my parent felt worried for me and told theyre not disappointed but only care for me and k disagree i also feel like a failure bc the only reason i came to this country wa for me to succeed and become a professional now im  and only have this life is unfairright now my best friend invited me to a movie night for her birthday i wa happy she even remember me for that and i agreed she told me some other friend are going and i wa like oh maybe her family member but it other honor student which i hate because theyre so happy  it stupid ik but i envy their life even my best friend bc shes so social she thought she say she isnt i envy their life envy is the word i envy them so much it going to be awkward for me when i get back im scared of her also getting bored of me i contarle had that fear when she talked to other kid im scared shell leave me bc there no way in hell shes going to still talk to me until senior year this might be stupid to even post but i just wanted to let it out it under social anxiety so maybe some people who know how it feel like can also be seen im still scared to go back but i need to because i want to be a professional i want to become a pediatrician or immigration lawyer i want to succeed and university will see this maybe it is truly all my fault it all hard,anxiety495,so i am still somewhat new to this job ive been there  month it is my first job out of college and it in an office in the accounting field i thought that picking accounting a a career would decrease the amount of social anxiety i have to deal with on a daily basis but it ha been the exact opposite so fareveryone at my company seems so outgoing and extroverted all the people on my immediate team of coworkers seem like theyre best friend and a lot of them have known each other for year they are also all at least  year older than me and very experienced in their career for these reason they are very intimidating to mewhen they talk to me or ask me question i get anxious and i feel like i end up sounding like a weirdo it also seems like they all have such interesting life and are always doing something fun over the weekendsbreaks and theyre always talking about it i had an incident with this one guy the other day he told me all about his trip he took over the holiday break then asked me what i did over my break and i just said i spent time with family and relaxedhe just said ohsounds kind of boring which made me feel like a giant loser i feel like they all think im a freak i do my best to come off a confident and try to make conversation but it is so so hard for me sometimes when we have free moment at work my coworkers will stand around and chat and i am always the only one who doesnt say anything i just feel so uncomfortable i dont have anything in common with my coworkers so i have no idea what to say anyway on the rare occasion that i do talk i tend to speak very quietly this is a habit i am trying so hard to break but i cant seem to when i speak i often get asked to repeat myself which make me feel so embarrassed at my most recent one on one meeting with my manager she mentioned that although my job performance is goodshe ha noticed that i am quiet and a lot of our coworkers think im too shy she recommended i just try to jump into the conversation a if it that easy ever since this meeting i feel even more anxious since it wa brought to my attention and i now know for a fact everyone think im too quiet prior to this i wa starting to feel a tiny bit more comfortable but now i am definitely going backwards with the progress i made thankfully my job is a hybrid schedule where im in the office three day a week and work from home the other two i wish more than anything i could work fully remotely going into the office ha felt so unbearable lately  this is not the first time this sort of thing ha caused issue for me at a job i have difficulty holding down a job because i get so upset over struggling to hold a conversation and worrying about people thinking im weird for being quiet that i usually ending up quitting before the one year mark i am also so worried i am going to get fired which add to my anxiety ever since i wa old enough to have a job i have struggled with this i cant seem to shake it  i really want to try therapy but my insurance wont cover it and it is very very expensive in my area anyone else here struggling badly with social anxiety in the workplace,anxiety496,my dad and mom split and thing fell apart between me and my mom it got bad enough to the point of me leaving i dont regret that but i have not talked to my grandmother over there in two year when i stopped going to my mom place they are pretty close to each other but i never had a problem with her personally she ha kept sending me money for christmas and birthday for the past  year and my day and other grandmother are telling me it time for me to call her i know they are right she wa never bad to me like my mom and the time i spent at her house during my mom time wa enjoyableim so scared i dont want her to try and reunite me and my mom or something but i want her to know me leaving is not on her and i still love her i have not talked in two year though what do i doi have really bad sa so this interaction is making me so nervous idk if ill sleep tonight,anxiety497,earlier today i ran out to the book store with my dad to look around and grab a coffee when we left we were right by noodle amp co so i asked if we could get some meatball real quick and he said yes so we went inside after i ordered we sat down at a small table against the wall and i noticed there wa a girl who had been standing behind me in line and wa now ordering she wa alone and i wa kind of awestruck by her because she wa one of the most attractive girl i had ever seen in my life i looked at her for a couple of second but the table we were at wa far enough away from the counter that i dont think she couldve known i wa looking at her when she placed her order she sat down at the closest bench which wa about  foot away from our table i wa kinda just staring at the counter and waiting for the order to be ready but i kept getting a feeling that she wa looking at me i didnt look back at her because im shy and shortly after she sat down she casually got up and wa seemingly looking for an empty table in the area behind where i wa sitting but after a couple second she sat back down on the bench i never looked towards the area behind where i wa sitting but i remember the place being very empty so i highly doubt there were no empty table behind me anyways i still kept getting the same feeling in my peripheral vision but eventually she pulled out her phone and it went away our order wa ready shortly after so we left the thing that confuses me is i felt like that girl wa looking at me but i feel like a girl that attractive would never look at me unless i had a stain on my jacket or something i checked and i didnt i dont mean to sound like a narcissist when i say i think im above average attractiveness for my age however im  and i didnt get a great look at her but the girl appeared to be at least  so i cant possibly imagine her being interested in me is there another reason she would be staring at me,anxiety498,hi guy tonight im literally dying inside im an italian guy and in a few month ill graduate at university when a student graduate a

starting the spring semester soon and id like to know if yall had any tip for getting more friend other than the surfacelevel class friendship tip on maintaining good conversation and making deeper connection because last semester i made a decent amount of friend in class but wed only talk about class stuff and whenever id try to move it out of class like ask to grab lunch they would never follow through or when i would make friend they were the type that would only want to hang out by going out to bar or club which i do enjoy but i want to find friend that also like to stay in or grab

everyone  curious if anyone ha some insight to this question or can relate to these feeling some context i wa swapping late christmas gift with my best friend due to miscommunication my bff went to my place and i went to my bffs place she called me a i pulled up and we agreed that she would head back to her place and i could chill inside the apartment with her roommate and cat her roommate are really cool and i enjoy hanging out with them but i wa hesitant to go inside for a few reason i wasnt supposed to be there so i arrived unannounced at pm which can totally be seen a rude and i understand why ive also never hung out with them by myself still i ring the door bell a roommate come up to the door and i announce who it is she let me in and we end up talking on the couch for a while until the other roommate come home from work during our conversation she mention she wa watching a tv show while waiting for roommate  to show up because they had something plannedimmediately my brain thought oh no ive inconvenienced her by interrupting her show and i apologized for it she assured me it wa fine and we kept talking but then i started to worry the other way by thinking what if now she feel like she ha to walk on egg shell around meokay so logically i understand that i should take her word for it if she said it wasnt a problem then im not being a bother i also logically know that im being harder on myself and that im projecting my insecurity onto her or assuming shell think the worst of me a a defense mechanism but emotionally i cant wrap my head around it and in the moment those worry consume me and it different to act differently from how i feel i plan on talking about this with my therapist but i figured id ask here too doe anyone experience this or have advice thanks for reading,anxiety513,im very used to adjusting to whatever person i am interacting with i notice myself heavily trying to integrate part of their behaviour into my own  their mannerism their style of speaking or over text what emojis and general writing style they choose i think i do this to cope with my feeling of anxiety so they can more easily relate to me and hopefully like me over the past year ive started to integrate le part of others into my own i cant fully let it go my anxiety spark too high for me to dare that at the past christmas and nye celebration it worked quite

that i enjoy this kind of social hangout a lot im just super not used to it and have no idea how to adjust to the behaviour of all these people especially cause theyre very be yourself dont be shy which isnt bad cause overall theyre really nice and understanding but they would probably notice me trying to adjust to behaviour im not used to im not a magician after all it would probably come off a clumsy and forcedbut ive been coming so far in laying off my compulsive copying this past month that ive been thinking why do i always have to adjust to everyone why cant people adjust to me for a change im extremely anxious about this party obviously but this time i want to try going in with the thought that it not my job to make people feel comfortable with me i can behave however i want a long a im not being a garbage human of course and they can do whatever they want with it they can like it they can hate it they can have absolutely zero opinion on it ill just bring myself to this party and they can adjust to me being me thats very easily said of course i know ill be completely up in my head when i arrive there but ill keep this mindset until then and maybe just maybe that

normally for me but i think it didnt for her thinking back i never really tried to connect with her and i wa just preoccupied with thinking of topicsshe is always with her bestfriends so it is hard to

first time doing itwhen i see her i feel like she is thinking i am not serious i dont hang out with her because she is always with her friend my only communication with her is through textsi asked her for a second date which she accepted the day came but the universe tried to stop it again thing happened and we fought but i managed to make up with her quickly our date then wa delayed for  week until we actually got it to happen this time it went better than the last but i missed some signal she clearly wanted me to be touchy with her but i did not i realized this after so i tried to hug her after the date and she wa really happythe next day i know i shouldve been closer to her but my social anxiety is still there so i didnt approach her again and i get shy with her friend the day after that until the holiday it wa me again being socially anxious and the universe not wanting u together i couldnt tell her im socially anxious because i know she would lose interest in me so i guess she just felt confused and thought i am not seriousshe tried to end thing with me politely by saying i should stop courting her because she is not ready but because this is my first relationship i denied her rejection after that she tried to give me silent treatment and ignored me so i decided to just give up and told her i will now stop courting her but still be friend deep inside me im still

since i wa a very young child my grandfather wa born there so before he passed i heard so many story and so many tidbit about his language it jumpstarted my lifelong passion of culture and linguistics and a healthy desire to travel around the age of  he passed away but those dream stuck around i ended up studying another language offered at my school unfortunately his wasnt offered but it very close and ended up becoming almost fluent extending my passion to foreign language  for many people wa a horrible year i had a sibling pas away a serious breakup and i couldnt seem to stay at a job more than  month before burning out and having to find another the only good thing about it wa i decided to hit the f it button and buy ticket to visit this country despite being financially unstable i wa afraid id never get another chance and i just kept on thinking about all the other thing i have missed out on life because i always found a way to reason myself out of it i wa terrified but i couldnt handle another regret in my life the month leading up to flying out were the worst i literally wouldnt allow myself to think about it or get excited i wa convinced id mess it up somehow either by doing something wrong at the airport or getting into such a mess that i couldnt go i couldnt even do what i love in life the most and study the language more before flying out every time id think about the trip despite it being my dream id get too anxious and just couldnt anymore before i knew it it wa time to fly out alone across the mother flipping atlantic leaving the country for the first time alone can you believe it and you know what i made it despite a flight delay and a german airport worker being pretty rude to me probably because im american i completely understand the disdain but i wanted to cry lol when i landed i started bawling i had hated myself for so long and never believed in myself but i made a dream happen i still cannot believe it i have been here for  hour and it still ha not hit but i just needed to share this to someone anyone who would listen because i hope it encourages more people to follow their dream i pushed through the anxiety and gained quite a

restarting lesson i keep panicking about it the pressure from my family and being reminded im nearly  so i have to drive make my heart race i get really emotional and feel absolutely drained after each driving lesson i also panic before each and every lesson i feel slightly better when driving is the only thing i have to do that day so i can take the rest of the day to recover from it all same go for doctor appointment and anything else serious i dont think driving is for me which i know sound awful a most people who i went to school with are driving and just living their life the truth is i panic too much i space out behind the wheel because im overthinking  i can sense when my instructor is annoyed at me by his tone of voice i struggle a lot with judging the distance eg slowing down at the right time knowing if im allowed to go at roundabout i sometimes pull out on a car without realising and my instructor ha to emergency stop every other my lesson my instructor give me the talk that the thing im doing wrong can cause a crash a it dangerous driving or a hazard i also get confused and sometimes forget my left and right but im not sure if thats because of the panic and the constant overwhelming feeling i always do something wrong each lesson and i go home feeling so ashamed a i know ill never get up to speed with everyone else my age ill always be that huge chunk behind which make me want to save the embarrassment and quitit doesnt help that here we have to do a online test theory at a test centre then a practical in the car and i only have a year to pas my practical

wasnt so bad and my day remained pretty much the same a always compared to when i wore my mask i felt a bit more insecure and selfaware today but once i can normalize in my brain that not wearing a mask is not going to cause an irreversible catastrophe then that anxiety should go away with time of course if im sick i will wear one for safety precaution but for today im proud of myself for doing

little bit without people looking at me like i have  head on i keep people at a distance and only speak when i absolutely have to because i know ill offend them otherwise there have been time when ive been to bar and various social outing and wanted to talk to people around mebut i cant think of one actual thing to say that would lead to a conversation no matter how hard i try my mind just blank on

also fear that shes going to mistake my intention and think im creepy or trying to hit on her even if i just wanted to have a genuine conversation because i found her interesting ive been rejected by a lot of woman for simply trying to make a conversation so i have this fear whenever i try using a dating app and get a match i cannot for the life of me think of one actual thing to sayand the thing

doe it add to the conversation it kinda boringwhatever ill say it oh the topic changed it like this every conversation or alternatively i get an idea to say something withhold and then someone else say what i wa kinda gonna i do come up to people i know to make conversation but they usually dont last long because i give dry or no answersquestionstopicsto people especially to one i want to be friend with i come off a boring and quiet i wa even told by many many people that i give off dad vibe quiet barely joke etc but thats not what im like or at least want to be like with my best friend

the fact that being good at socializing doesnt not mean you have to say the right thing of course the word you choose in a conversation can dictate a certain flow and a masterful articulation of word can be enticing but most people are not able to do sowhat is important is how you make them feel think about it the people you like do you remember what they said to make you like them probably not the key is how they made you feel because you dont forget those feeling they are within yousocializing is not a game of i said these thing so please like me or yes we had a conversation so that mean we bonded time can build a relationship but it through working together rapport can be built what you want to develop are not way in which you can make people like you but rather way in which you can make people feel good and most importantly do not do it with the intent of making them like you that is a byproduct of socializing not an expectation,anxiety613,ive had a good christmas and new year

drunk lady come in another lady that wa banned  and ha to be kicked out of the store she wa on something and acting very strange according to my coworker  luckily this all happened while i wa working with someone however i am generally by myself i dont know if my social anxiety is making worse but i am scared to work by myself i am worried about my safety my bos ha been very good to let me work just two day a week and it is very hard to find such an accommodating work place she say i can always call the other store they own across the street if i ever feel overwhelmed or unsafeit is not too bad now that it cold out but once thing warm up there will be more people about and coming into the store   including not so good peoplei dont know what to do i would like to work with someone for all my shift for safety or i can quit we dont need my income but i know it is good for me to get out  i dont even  know how to ask my bos  i rarely see her and my social anxiety make me not want to

im not sure why i could just be myself for a moment even with people aroundi do want to say that i dont recommend doing this on top of all this ive also been feeling restless jittery and unbelievably sleepy my head kept falling down during class it not worth it i just wanted to share my weird experience,anxiety620,the incidentgti m wa sitting in a caf while doing doing math exercise and i had few table of people around me doing their own thing i noticed that a woman in the corner took off her shoe and kicked up her foot on the couched seating so i decided to do the same and got comfy i would occasionally take a look around me and shed return a brief look nothing special i check my surroundings all the time i thoughtgta while after switching to reading my book and properly kicking back on the seating i notice her leaving she then proceeds to scoot over to my table say i dont really do this often but and leaf a note before going in it she wrote her number some compliment and her saying it ok if i dont feel like going out or datingdespite the reassurance and nice tone in their note my hand immediately started shaking and i felt a huge pressure to message them the biggest issue is that i literally know nothing of this person be it their personality age motif or interest a day later and i still hate the idea of messaging them since i dont know how to reject them via text if theyre not my type i really dont want to ghost someone but dropping a note like that on a stranger should mean that youre ready to not get an answer right ive always preferred facetoface interaction with stranger since it a lot easier to read social cue and their intent im also anxious about going to that caf and seeing them againi always thought someone giving me their number would be a dream come true but this fucking suck,anxiety621,ive had this job for almost two and a half year and i didnt mind it until recently i dont know what changed but the now the thought of going in to work ruin my day make me anxious and give me trouble sleeping at night im a cashier which is terrible for me because im awkward and somewhat cold due to social anxiety i feel like the repetitive nature of being a cashier ha drained me and i dread interacting with customer i feel pathetic because it literally a part time job and i only work twice a week now im  and i dont need this job to survive or anything but even then i dread the two day i have to go into work if i worked friday i would already be dreading it by monday doesnt help that one of my manager is biased towards male cashier and female cashier are nitpicked at and treated worse i want to quit so bad but im afraid i wont find another job because the thought of working in general is now giving me anxiety  what should i do,anxiety622,heyyy senior why are u so cute n sweet till now u might turn bitter to me but idc i cant help fallim for uuuuuuu i dont hv anyone to express these feeling so i am expressing here his

guy is a curse i gotta study now,anxiety623,cw acronymsso first off yes sa can mean either sexual assault or  social anxiety i understand thathowever sa sexual assault is a much more triggering and anxiety enducing thing to read aboutusing the abbreviation sa social anxiety make sense but there are other acronym used just a much and though some have double meaning those meaning are at least either in the same ballpark or at very least tied to le triggering contentso my question is thisis it not hypocritical to insist on using a term which trigger anxiety in others when you yourself have anxietywhy even after being educated on the subject and  offered reasonable alternative would you still choose to use a term that will make others anxiouswhy would anyone in their right mind choose that hill to die onignorance is forgiveable but willful ignorance is just plain disgusting behaviour a space for discussing anxiety should be safe and supportive many here cant seem to understand that for some reason,anxiety624,i wanna run away and change my name besties,anxiety625,i opened up about my social anxiety to a friend today and wanted to ask if they would like to hang out today they basically told me that therapy would help with my anxiety and that wa it felt kinda like a slap in the facei wa dejected i felt pathetic after i calmed down a bit from my anxiety attack i remembered something that my therapist because yes i actually go to one told me the only person who will be there for you through everything is you everyone ha their own life to lead and sometimes they just dont want to talk to you dammit they may hate you they may genuinely be busy they may just feel like hanging out with someone else that day people are not defined by opinion they are defined by their own thought and feeling about themselves and people with social anxiety like me and others on this sub we are so caught up in what other people think or might think that we fail to think deeply about who we actually are we neglect to spend quality time with ourselvesnone of this mean i dont struggle hell i still feel pathetic right now and probably will for the rest of the day it take a whole lot of time and effort to internalize these belief there no magical cure for social anxiety but yknow what im on the bus right now alone im not meeting up with anyone im going to get a tattoo have a beer and finally finish the book im reading at a cafe im going to feel selfconscious and horrible but im going to persist i need to make peace with the fact that no one will be there for me if im not there for myselffeels good to admit that no one care,anxiety626,all my m with innatentive adhd life it been weird for me to communicate with people but i didnt think much of it until last year when some series of event triggered a sudden interest in psychology and self reflection i determined that i am severely lacking empathy so ive started trying to be more actively interested in the people  i am interacting with and it seems i am getting some limited understanding of their inner working but it feel like i am emulating behaviour that other people innately exhibit and i am unable to put myself in their shoe so to speak only to coldly observe is this expected early on when trying to develop empathy if yes what should i focus on to improve ive been having trouble communicating with people  i dont know how to start or continue a conversation when i am very interested in the subject i will be able to talk for a while but most of the time if i realize that the other person ha a more limited understanding of the subject than me  i end it since i get super bored and it feel like whatever i am trying to convey fly well above their head i am interested in improving this aspect but i am not sure how i could go around and do thatwhen i am not interested in the subject or have a limited interest but not much knowledge about it i either get super bored or try to put some open ended question in so i can get more domain info and be able to continue however i generally fail to identify any hook in their response to be able to move the conversation forward  when i think about it later they seem obvious though but in the moment i just go blank and the talk go into awkward silence unless the other person is very socially savvy and interested in continuing it   when i attempt smalltalk it feel like im the most boring person ever and that it extremely dry and that i am failing to liven it up when faced with unexpected social situation i tend to panic and shut down where others would have improvised a response on the fly what are some coping strategy to be able to improvise acceptable response to new situationsi feel like chatting up random stranger in the street would considerably improve all these issue i am having but it feel super weird to just make a point to go out for a walk and talk to random people how could i ease into this a the thought of it terrifies me and i think i am also having a big fear of rejection issuei know this is mostly an incomplete halfstructured rant  but i would appreciate any thought or insight that may be able to helpe improve in this direction,anxiety627,what sort of situation have you put yourself through in order to face your social anxiety ie clubbing bar concert etc etc,anxiety628,ive been getting really red hot and start swalloving fast everytime i try to speak to someone or when i feel awkward or when someone is just looking at me i dropped out of school because of this i feel embarrased all the time it came out to the point where i feel awkward in front of my familyfriendsgf and cant talk to someone without thinking of getting red even if someone is looking at me through screen i get this  everywhere do

their challenge and struggle with social anxiety and thats for good reason it great that there are safe space like these on the internet dedicated to a particular issue where people who share that issue can come together and vent to one anotherbut i wa sort of wondering if there anyone who hang around here that feel at least for the most part that theyve learned how to live a good enough life in spite of their social anxiety people whove learned to coexist with it obviously the anxiety isnt something we destroy or defeat it something we learn to live with something we make work for u and not against u so i decided to put up this post for those people tell u how thing are going there bound to be something we can learn from you guy,anxiety631,when i hit puberty one day out of the blue it just turned on like a lightswitch and all of a sudden i started being super anxious about what everyone thought about me i can still remember the very moment it happened did this happen for you guy

come down on me all of my s can be summarized a me desperately trying to fit in in any way after being bullied for year a sort of fear of being different in any way got instilled into menow i feel like i am sexually deviant  year ago i lost sexual attraction to my ex girlfriend for a condition she had and it the whole thing wa just ridiculous since it never changed her look but it wa all in my head it made me feel broken and wrong a a human being in a way i have never felt before it gave me guilt on a whole new level and i struggle to tell anyone since simply out of fear of being judged so harsh after all this shit would have gotten me killed during my high school year because i developed ed and pissing anyone off meant being ridiculedbeaten upso yeah heart palpitation every morningd delightfull i am making progress and seen a psych for a year i need more though so i will make an appointment with the gp today for a referral i need to stop being stubborn and accept more help open upim just ranting and venting here so ciao,anxiety634,im an introvert with sad and i think im gonna go get help soon im literally so anxious it physically hinders me in public most of the time but i wanted to know if going through therapybeing on med made you more social at all im pretty confident im an introvert but i think my sad really amplifies it to the max for the longest time now i just absolutely do not care about engaging with others unless they like the same stuff a i do but ive found when im drinking and have le anxiety ill pretty much talk to whoever and actually be somewhat engaged no matter what theyre talking about so im hoping therapymeds will be kind of a more permanent thing rather than having to drink to talk to people hope that make sense,anxiety635,removed,anxiety636,ive been stressing out for day now thinking about how i have to get picked up by my cousin for work and dropped back off at the end of the day a well we work together but i dont usually start conversation all that much whereas he super outgoing and like to talk a lot i realize the situation is way worse in my head than in reality but i wish i could just skip till the end of the car ride im seriously dreading tomorrow lol,anxiety637,the title sum it up my social anxiety is so severe that i am not capable of enjoying social interaction at all in most context there is basically no one on earth who i can sit and have an enjoyable conversation with without any hint of social anxiety brain freeze or having at least several little moment during our interaction where my brain automatically retreat in on itself honestly at best i will enter a conversation confidently to a degree but a soon a my brain initially turn inward it basically game over and i wont have anything further to contribute no joke no emotional support nothing fun nothing of interest coming to my mind at all to say once my brain turn inward the latter is more of an issue because i am also terribly insecure about my social skill a much a i try to learn the anxiety itself get in the way in my experience it is not possible to have a pleasant or fun interaction with other people if i am experiencing the anxiety so i put myself out there and try to sit during conversation and listen and whatnot and i try to observe what other people do that make them successful i think my anhedonia make it difficult for me to be in that head space that make people likable i only ever feel truly comfortable in my own skin when i am drunk inb someone warns about making drinking a habit it not and i believe it is vitally important for me to understand how to get to the emotional state that i get to when drinking without having to drink because i truly believe now that the way i feel when i am drunk is the way normal people feel justwhen they are out living their everyday life which sometimes make me feel cheated in life but i try not to entertain that line of thinking since it is considered immature to lament over lost time or anything really i just dont understand what ha to happen for me to get into that headspace right now i am basically  socially nonfunctional in that i just cant connect emotionally with others in addition to all that i think i am terrified of any kind of intimacy i have a decent immediate family but my brain feel absolutely repulsed by the idea of even having that kind of blood familial connection because it signal a level of closeness that i guess i cannot handle like i cant even handle looking at anyone in my family in the face and saying i love you because it feel too intimate it make me cringe internally just to type those word out on a reddit post there something about emotional bondingi dont seem capable of it i feel like i am only capable of emotionally bonding with companion animal like cat and dog it like with them it feel safe to show affection i think it actually upset my family when they see me spending half the time with the family cat when i visit i mean i understand their perspective and why they might feel that way i dont really understand why im like this but i do know that if i cant show any type of affection or care or emotion for my perfectly nice supportive and amicable family then i definitely cant succeed in having a small talk with a stranger that will feel at all rewarding for said stranger i hope that make sensedoes thinking and feeling this shit make me crazy am i just fucked up or what i mean fuck i dont see why i take the time to write this shit out i mean it is cathartic but i do feel this part of me that want to believe i can just throw my life story on here and somebody will arrive with all the correct and pertinent answer maybe thats just a symptom of me not being able to afford any kind of mental health treatment at all the more i look into it the more i think about it the more i read on it it seems like mental health care is a very special kind of privileged some people work their ass off just to afford some kind of plastic surgery to fix a banal physical imperfection that probably actually look totally fine while i work my as off to have the chance at maybe possibly finding and receiving the relevant mental health care that might maybe possibly click with me and systemically address my issue in such a way that i am able to live out the second half of my life without social anxiety or depression coming up on  in a few year fuck,anxiety638,ive had social anxiety for the last couple year now and it sometimes fluctuates how bad it is depending on what management we have at work the management we have now is alright but there this one person that straight up instills fear in me whenever i realize im going to have to work with her the reason is

in it,anxiety646,hello and happy new year everyoneok so  year ago i started working a a barista when i wa a new hire i wa painfully shy and not completely comfortable in my skin which i think is normal for a  year old one of my coworkers had been there for a little longer then me he wa friendly and we developed a pretty good rapporti remember there came a point where he would ask me personal question like what kind of music i liked what i did for fun what i did after work etc he also started giving me little compliment here and there like that i had a good work ethic and my green jacket looked good on mei would usually respond with some sort of lighthearted joke because thats my personality and im really not in love with receiving too much attention i didnt feel a if he wa being creepy at all but i suspected that he might be developing a crush on me he asked me out not long after that and i quicklyawkwardlyembarrassingly stated that im not interested in dating which wa truewhen i wa younger i got picked on a lot boy always told me i wa ugly and gross and they meant it i never had a boyfriend or had a guy say that he liked me before unless he wa making fun of me romantic relationship were never a priority for me but i know that this treatment from boy effected me on some level i wa and would still be caught off guardembarrassed if someone earnestly asked me out or complimented me my mom also had a very bad marriagedivorce and sometimes tell me extreme advice to protect myself when dealing with boy stuff like they try to get to know you to make you comfortable and manipulate you i take her saying lightly but i know it ha also effected the way i am around boysafter i turned him down he seemed to take it well and thing continued pretty normally then one night the guy this other guy z and myself were working together me and z were also very good buddy because we both thought the other wa so funny i never had any romantic feeling towards him and i didnt feel he wa attracted to me we were all cleaning together z say something to me and i think from what i remember he called me captain or bos or something a a joke and in what i thought wa a goofy voice i responded i love it when you call me that but i must of said in like a flirty way or something because the next thing i know both of them are looking at me in this super stunned eye brow razed manner and the main guy not z look so furious with me in the moment i had no idea what wa happening i wa so taken aback so i just kind of went back to cleaningthen i wanted to go in the back for a towel or mop or something and then out of nowhere the main guy not z start yelling at me he say thing like i can get it for you im right here why didnt you ask me forget it then he storm off to the back and this pissed me off so much because it came out of nowhere and i also didnt understand what wa going on we didnt speak to each other for the rest of the evening and when i left i didnt say goodbyelater i thought that maybe he reacted the way he did is because he thought i wa flirting with z in front of him but him yelling at me made me so mad because i wasnt flirting at all and i wasnt even his girlfriendi also got the vibe that he wa slightly sexist because whenever we were on bar together he would always give me a hand with drink even when i said i didnt need help then if he wa on bar and i decided to help him he would get so mad at me or if i wa trying to reach something he would say thing like im right here i can get it for you just say please just ask for help in a really condescending tone and id be like i got it i can do it it already in my hand then the big blow up happened and i wa so irritated at him i stopped talking to him and stopped saying hello when we worked together pretty soon he stopped talking to me too everything wa so awkward but i just hated the way he actedlong story short we both quit working there but i decided to come back after i had been gone a year to make some extra money z also quit working therefrom time to time he not z come in a a customer to visit this one guy who work there and i feel so awkward when i see him i just dont know how to feel or how to handle the situationlike i still hate the fact that he yelled at me and couldnt handle my independent nature this is what it felt like and in fact he would always get a little huffy when other female worker wouldnt want his help he not american i think he wa like ethiopian or something i just got the sense he really liked submissive trait in female v the louder independent trait and i think it ha to do with his culture he also becoming a doctor and can give off this im the smartest person in the room energy from time to timenevertheless he not a bad guy at all and i dont think i handled the situation correctly even though i wa  and am now only  i feel embarrassed about the entire situation but dont know how to make it better i also dont feel he wa completely in the right i have this thing where i want to feel a if i have won the conversation when issue like this arise i want to be the bigger person i thinkwhat are your thought what do i do doe anything need to be done how do i feel cool with myself when he come in i mostly just avoid eye contact is that a good strategy what would you do if you were me i need perspectivethanks for reading i really needed to

gotten so bad that ive had difficulty communicating with some of my male coworkers in my current job a a cna there wa one time i overheard a conversation between one of the male nurse i have been especially shy around and a female colleague they were both mentioning how hard it is to try to talk to me whenever this one male nurse and i are put in the same assignment together i could barely look him in the eye let alone start a conversation with him and whenever i needed to report something to him or try to ask him for help i always hesitate and my voice crack when i do i hate that im like this with him especially when the first couple month i have worked with him it mightve felt like i told him off when he wa just offering to lend a hand and i said that he shouldnt because i wa used to working alone i thought i wa being considerate of his time and his workload in my previous workplace my coworkers made me feel like a nuisance for always asking for help and never doing anything on my own when our type of work should involve teamwork for the sake of meeting the need of our patient and our back im always cry about it every time i come home i started thinking that it got so bad between u that i couldve sworn i saw him go to our manager office and request to be assigned to different patient from me we havent been caring for patient on the same assignment for a few month now and it took me until recently to realize that he always in the back while im always in the front nowadays and so for  i wanna improve my relationship with others starting with the workplace so if there anyone willing to give me any advice to help me with this resolution id greatly appreciate it,anxiety724,removed,anxiety725,i have been doing very well overall with my class i am going back tuesday but my brain is torturing me with this certain professor who ha picked random people to answer why doe this scare me so much im stuck on this thought and it really bothering me i have

smile because i feel rude if i dont then once i do start to smile i literally cant and i end up smiling thru the whole conversation lmaomakes me feel weird but also good,anxiety727,i feel like perhaps pretending to be apart of one of these clique may actually help me in adopting a personality due to social anxiety im very reserved and quite boring i feel like maybe adopting fashion from one of these group may result in people understanding me better a a person i obviously know nothing of goth and emos and how theyre separate but they are always presented a quite reserved in medium maybe this is just a stereotype i dont know ill have to actually research this eventually ill probably look like a clown though so i wont go through with it but people understanding me without word is a nice dream,anxiety728,i use to wish it wa possible to get rid of my inner monologue but then i realized my anxiety wasnt even caused by any thought i had but an inevitable thing i felt when surrounded by other people so i truly dont care persay what people think about me but being around them alone give me anxiety to the point where i cant preform like my normal self what is the solution to this or should i seek therapy,anxiety729,i want to maintain friendship in order to do that you have to spend time with people i like my friend but spending time with even my closest friend sends me into an anxiety spiral that can take day to recover from i worry if they are having fun if i have said anything to make them uncomfortable if i seem like im talking about myself too much i spend week ruminating on every weird thing i said it not even worth the stressbut if i go too long without socializing with friend i start to get paranoid that i dont have enough friend which also give me so much anxiety it like i want to have friend but i dont actually want to spend time with them that is the wrong way to go about friendship you should spend time with people because it make you happy not to collect people so you can feel likeable the truth is i like my friend but i am a true introvert i would be ok with socializing outside of work maybe twice a month top but in order to build and maintain friendship it requires a full social calendar i have tried in the past to be that once in a while friend it doesnt work people end up excluding you if you turn down their invitation too frequently how do you other introvert cope,anxiety730,ive just digested the fact that im going back to school this week and now im struggling to enjoy the rest of new year day currently im registering the homework that i havent done and the idea of going back to school it making my stomach drop ive never really enjoyed the school atmosphere walking to class a if im a robot on autopilot

cannot move to save my life and it just feel so damn awkard i want to puke however even if i wa alone i would not dance i would experience the same thing and feel super awkward yes the presence of people enhances that akwardness but i would still feel uncomfortable alone some people seem to get along so easily have fun and decent chat cheer with their drink and stuff yet this make me feel so out of place how can they do this like it seems so natural and some people like me or my past freinds are just very idk not natural like we feel out of place i look at these people like they are a

especially parent or sibling it always make me feel a though i cant be myself around them after working on my anxiety i feel so much more comfortable around stranger because they wont ever have to see me again even if i mess up in an interaction or my friend or girlfriend because i trust them much more than my family membersit might have to stem with my korean mom always forcing me to do the best i can getting a  wasnt good enough she would always ask why wasnt it a  and it felt a though my father wasnt even in the picture with parenting because he wa in the armed force until he retired which wa way too late to have an impact on how i wa raised there a part of me that really want to just never talk to any of them again after i move away even if it make me feel bad in a way i wa raised in a semigood environment never really having to worry about food or thing thanks to my parent however i think there a lot of emotional and physical abuse thats really affected me a a child and thats been surfacing recently i cant even remember most of my childhood i feel cold and detached from them and i think it mostly also because i cant relate to them with how much older they are compared to me and i never have conversation with my older sister either,anxiety737,i  f have been with my fianc  m for almost  year since we both still live at home whenever i visit i stay at his house with his family his family are very welcoming people and make me feel so welcomed but i still feel so anxious around them ive tried explaining to my fianc that i feel out of place due to our family difference and how we grew up in completely different home setting for example his parent are still together while mine are divorced his family is well off financially and mine struggled i always feel fine when i first arrive but after a day i feel like im glued to his bedroom due to anxiety and the fear of being awkward or embarrassing myself sometimes i dont even leave to eat because of how nervous i am just wondering if anyone else is feeling this and how i should go about improving,anxiety738,hellothank you so much for reading this there is a tldr at the bottomi have a habit of coming to this subreddit making a post and then deleting it a while later hopefully i dont delete this before somebody read it i know i need therapy i need someone involved other than myself at the moment im all that i got no friend and i never opened up to any family member about my struggle with debilitating anxiety fear control me and ha been extremely destructive to my life a few month ago i reached out for inperson mental health service through my university i had a required phone appointment with a mental health specialist to ass my symptom and access further service through the university which wa extremely difficult but i somehow managed through i wa then supposed to have a zoom appointment with another specialist to discus therapy option and to understand my insurance i thought i wa going to be able to pull through but i canceled last minute out of fear this wa week ago at the time they sent me an email saying i could call the office to reschedule the appointment but i never did call due to anxiety i dont know if it too late to call now especially since the service here are pretty backloggedi heard of online therapy and i have tried betterhelp multiple time but always struggled with it i heard online therapist dont take their online client a serious a their inperson client so i always got discouraged im thinking about trying it again and forcing myself to communicate with the therapist through text at least no matter how uncomfortable it can be and hopefully derive some sort of benefit from it i dont have much money to spare but i would do it if i have no other option perhaps somebody here know of a better sitesummarytldr my effort at therapy have been failure ive attempted to initiate both inperson and online therapy but ive failed due to my anxiety and discouragement that the therapy isnt going to work im thinking of trying online therapy again betterhelp if there is no better andor cheaper option with lowincome state health insurance i could try attempting to reschedule a zoom appointment through my school but im not sure if i have that in me at the moment,anxiety739,ik this sound cringe but it true i feel like i will never find a girl like that who is adventurous and funny every girl i see are just not for me seriously what are the chance of finding someone like that,anxiety740,ever since i graduated from college ive had a hard time of it socially ive tried reaching out to people but it seems a if they try to push me away or they lose interest in pursuing friendship idk whether it me or if people dont know how to socialize nowadays or potentially both after a while your motivation to even try to talk to others fade and you feel intimidated and awkward even trying to do soyou feel like a hindrance or annoyance to others and you want to isolate further ive felt the most isolated ive ever felt in my life if it wasnt for a supportive family i would honestly have no one,anxiety741,the social thing wa basically a new year day thing where do a vision board never heard of them before this anyway i wa sat at a table with four others  i think two were a couple and the other two came alone also it wa a bit uncomfortable a wa awkward silence a we were doing this vision board thing the couple seemed to speak to each other and i found it awkward a i wa conscious about speaking to one of the other guy but not the otheranyway  the guy i wa sat beside seemed like a decent enough guy and actually swapped phone number with him at the end  maybe will meet him to watch some live music somedaywell see  so im glad i went and got some more exposure in after it i went to a bar by myself  i did this recently and got on ok  so said id give it another go in the same bar again the bar wa busy and there wa live music on which is what i want i saw some guy watching the sport on television so asked him a question about the match and then spoke to him for maybe another minute then before i left the guy performing the music said he wa finishing upthere wa some woman beside me so i just said id ask her a quick question just to practice initiating conversation  i think i just asked something like is there someone else performing next or something like this  she answered and didnt seem overly enthusiastic to speak further not rude or anything  just very neutral so i just left it at that it another bit of exposure so thats good,anxiety742,the possibility of hanging out with friend ha me overthinking and trying to come up with excuse not to most of the thing i see online is about social anxiety disorder are about interaction with stranger but im usually fine in those situation i moved abroad a few month ago i think almost trying to escaoe feeling this way anytime i meet someone who i could

tryna build a relationship with him so i went the first night pretty nervous but confident bc i wa dressed up and had my makeup done and looked cute and started talking to people and getting compliment and wa dancing but it wa still difficult for me to live in the moment because there so many sensation around me and i feel like all eye are on me and theyre judging the way i move which make me feel stiff and dissociated even though i try so hard to focus on the music and let go and every time i meet someone i just cant shake the feeling that i know i did something wrong anyways so first night wa pretty good but still a nervous wreck but the second night lolollll so we camped out in the car and it wa kinda rough so i had a decent outfit but no makeup and no shower and felt a lot more insecure this time i tried warming up but wa having trouble especially seeing all the beautiful girl around me and feeling like i dont belong i lost my brother in the beginning and ended up in another crowd and i wa just tryna vibe by myself and i wa doing okay just trying to have free dance move but i wa still very anxious so it wa kinda hard but i met this girl who wa very nice and we became friend but i felt a little patronized by her i joined her group with her boyfriend and this other guy they were big frat party people who were not exactly my type of crowd but they were cool and had a lot of similar interest the girl wa trying so hard to make me feel comfortable and included and she went up to this girl dancing with light who took her for a lil spin and then i felt weird but tried dancing with her and she just kinda looked at me and said here wanna try and gave her light to me so she wouldnt have to dance with me i felt like i got punched in the gut so we went somewhere else and i did coke for the first time and they bought me a bunch of drink and i hit their nicotine a lot which i had quit earlier in the year and smoked one of the joint i brought in so needle to say i wa pretty fucked up im not a big partier and i dont do many substance other than weed and psychedelics and i used to drink a lot of alcohol but drastically cut down earlier in the year a well so i wa feeling okay warming up still a bit unsure where the fuck i wa but we moved toward the middle of the crowd in the front during the countdown and i wa all up on this dude and we kissed at midnight and started vibing hard and i wa dancing with him and then got an intense feeling to vomit so he helped me leave the crowd and sat with me in the chill out place and i couldnt help it but i puked on the floor and he wa being nice he helped me clean it up but i still felt so awful and embarrassed and i know he wanted to party i tried going back in but felt nauseous every time i stood up so he waited for with me for a bit i got some water used the bathroom but i told him he could go back in if he wanted and he said hed wait for a minute acting like he cared but i knew he wanted to get away and i let him but he still kissed me goodbye and i just kinda sat there for a bit before going back to the crowd i felt so awful knowing that i made friend and fucked it up i didnt even like the guy that much anyways but it the fact that all that happened and i embarrassed the shit out of myself they tried finding me after but i got distracted talking to some other people and the guy got really dry with me and i think theyre all ghosting me now im so ashamed of myself and dont know why my life is just one big embarrassment and this wa my fourth rave and each time i go i ask myself why the fuck am i here but i still want to have fun and im very interested in getting into this scene because i know i could have a lot of fun i just dont right now  i love dressing up and doing extravagant makeup and dancing but i get very overwhelmed in a scene like that it just feel like there a constant veil between me and the real world and im always trying to mask myself and i want so badly just to be able to be my most confident self because i think im a very beautiful girl with a great character but i have so much trauma and anxiety and i get triggered by fucking everything i

when i came i told myself that i didnt want no one to talk to me because in my old school people would not like me when i wa being myself i didnt have anxiety idk why i did this but i regret it so much after the first month i started to feel extremely lonely and i ended up developing anxiety if i made friend i wouldnt of  left the school and went to an online school because now i have really

numbness when it come to dating and being socialhas anyone here felt like when trying to be social that you are not really present and even though you want to connect it like your emotion have gone numb,anxiety766,i know this may sound stupid butanywaysim not sure if i have social anxiety because for example i overthink a lot everything related to socializing i cant avoid imagining different scenario and preparing different answer or reaction to act properly i always feel like im being watched and judged if i hear voice or whisper behind me i freak out and think that they are making fun of me if i hear step behind me in the street i start getting sweat and i cant walk normally since i feel like im walking wrong i had what i think is a panic attack once in a bus i literally paralized started sweating a lot my heart wa beating super fast and i felt like everyone in the bus wa watching mebutim completly able to go to school and talk with almost everyone is hard sometimes because of

mix of many people my own friend and his they seemed to have a good time together tho everyone wa mixing and interacting with each otherat some point however when everyone finally arrived thing got kinda weirdi think near the end of the night the party started to get dull some people were talking others wanted to play video game and a i wanted to please everyone i couldnt really figure out what everyone could do together so i guess i started stonewalling and couldnt really make a choice on what to do i kept going towards the mingling since i wa enjoying the conversation i wa having cause i figured if im enjoying this i might a well keep to it until everyone agreed to something my bf wa also drunk and mingling so i had no clue or people were upset with u for not being organized with the eventeventually people started to leave and the anxiety wa getting worse i didnt stop anyone from leaving but the remaining guest were kinda weird and just not at all having anything to do with me everytime i tried to talk it seemed liked awkward silence would follow and everyone wa just uncomfortable to speak with mei had to walk out on the party because i just hated being in the room for that i felt i wa being singled out the whole time i later tried to come back but it felt like the weird vibe wa still theremind you i wa drunk so i felt like maybe i wa overwhelmed by the crowd and my sensory overload with the noise of it all but i also think thing were off entirely maybe there wa drama i wasnt picking up on or maybe people werent feeling the party i felt so out of touch with the whole thing that im not really sure how to interpret what wa going ontldr im wa a drunk social anxious person who threw a party and i think everyone hated it because all there wa food drink and talking is that good enough or should i have worked more on getting everyone to do something together wa everyone expecting too much out of me or did i get way too into my head and miss out on having fun,anxiety770,im in very stressful spot now i just want to be alone and go to sleep for  hour,anxiety771,i had to do a presentation and the good thing wa that it wa online i kinda did have a big part but i wa prepared i knew what to say and explain and i also wa the one who had to share my screeni went in completely normal not anxious at all and ready but a it went on i wa shivering i wa cold my mouth went dry my heart rate went up etc like mann i know in my head im not nervous at all i know what to say  i kept reassuring myself that it wa gonna be okay but no my body never understands  and the worst thing wa this wa just the practice session the real one tomorrow yall please wish me luck i dont know what else to do,anxiety772,when i texted a staff member i wont be able to come to my placement due to a family obligation next wednesday she said that is ok thanks for giving u lot of notice enjoy your family time i still feel anxious and guilty,anxiety773,im having a meeting tomorrow and i may have to talk in front of many people nearly  person i hate this i doubt myself too much in this even though i work hard and achieve remarkable result but i think i will do something wrong and weird there i know ill look awkward and weird and they will whisper too much about me some will be bullying,anxiety774,firstly i never thought i would make a post about this but i guess i just wanted to get it out of my system i am not the best with word also but it new year and i want to change thing so here go so i think i am socially anxious and introverted worst combination to go with huh i have never really mentioned this to anyone but i suspect my family is aware of it a little bit not sureokay so to start with i have trouble mixing in group conversation or carrying conversation for long also if someone go to make comment about me even a a joke i get triggered for example someone mentioned that i am boring a a joke but it still hurt me i think that is because even though they said it wa a joke i know that is likely true and it made me just sad and uncomfortable and not knowing how to reply to that also whenever i talk to someone i am constantly thinking about if i make a dumbstupid decision or give wrong answer accidentally and if someone tease me by laughing it make me conscious and again uncomfortable these type of situation make me want to get away from whatever i am doing and be alone for a bit so i can compose myself because i start to overthink unknowingly stop listening to someone a i am still thinking about what someone said to me that made me uncomfortable hate myself and also my head start to tremblei feel like because of this i could not make much friend in my life it suck all these feeling just get in my way and i hate it a they hold me back from being better honestly not sure what i am expecting from making a post here i have more to say but my thought process just doesnt come naturally so i end it here if you can relate in any way let me know and let me know if i can even help myself to bypass this social anxiety cause again it fucking suck,anxiety775,right now i dont have friend in the state i live in  i kind of miss the day where there were chat room  is there anything similar  im  and female by the way  or is there anything else you would recommend  second life is still around just with le people  in the future when im ready to find in person friend again i will try bumble bff,anxiety776,it isnt,anxiety777,i dont know if thats common or not but i love game but i hate multiplayers and mmos just for the simple fact that i have to talk with people i mean i usually play the game like they are single player but i get anxious everytime someone try to talk with me or when i reach the endgame and multiplayer content is  impossible to ignore if i want to playwhy i just not play single player and ban multiplayer from my existence because i like the concept i want to make friend that dont really put me on social situation and because my boyfriend is a sucker for mmos and i want to enjoy game he like with him but when we reach the point of getting into guild and stuff i just freak out and im like his personal bot thats because i overthink too much what to say than i get out of the timming to responde than i worry too much about my performance and feel useless because im too stress to just play like i doand same thing about social medium i delay everything i want to do like posting photo on instagram or something because i dont really want the attention but i would like to just share the photo but again overthink to much until it just too outdated to post reddit is the only place i can actually talk but not without rereading everything what it seems a thousand time before i post it and regret about what i said and how i said it after ive send it so thats me and i just want to know if im not alone cause everyone i talked who had social anxiety or who seemed to could talk with stranger or acquaintance online without having this overwhelming feeling and thought,anxiety778,a the title say im atheist and my family very devoted christian they all went for cross over service last night it pm where im at right now and im still left spending the day alone it ha always been this way you see so im kinda used to it i met someone in rehab who ha been there for me theyre the only one keeping me company anyone else alone in this trying time and would wanna talk sending positivity on this day for those of u struggling and cant get ourselves to go out,anxiety779,so i tried to be social many time trying to be extrovert in the past  trying to not think much about everything about like a week but after that i get this wave of sadness guilt and embarassment which make me shut down again it is so weird and i dont know what to do about it tbh i just gave up at this point and just let whatever happen  i cant change,anxiety780,removed,anxiety781,i cant even articulate this straight im diagnosed with social anxiety and major depressive disorder i went into yesterday nye party with my partner feeling anxious of how i looked and being with others a well a feeling depressed because well i experience depressive episode that feel difficult to manage at time of course i ended up drinking a shit ton of alcohol to the point that i had to pull my partner aside from the party and cried my heart out i essentially dumped every intrusive thought i had surrounding my depression and anxiety im feeling embarrassed and guilty for acting that way especially with my partner who ive been dating for only one year it feel really difficult to move on from this and i wanted to ask you all for some kind word because i feel so isolated and like a burden,anxiety782,i have suffered with social anxiety for some timesince i wa a kid and getting really bad once i wa in high school i wa thinking of messaging an old friend to essentially apologize for cutting her off because of my social anxiety we went to the same grade school together and she wa a year below me we were really really good friend we would have sleepover played softball together our parent were good friend etc then i went to high school a much bigger place than my small grade schooland lost a good sense of social security i could not really make friend i wa awkward and super quiet and would just clam up this wa the complete opposite of my fairly social grade school selfin becoming this person with socially anxious tendency i abandoned my old friend from grade schooljust wouldnt talk to her or say hi i definitely came off a rude to her and i think this really messed with her i weirdly cut her off without me not wanting to over the past year and a half ive went through therapy and med and feel like im really starting to get my old self backthe person who i know i am who can make friend and be a generally likeable person so my question is this if you cut off someone from your past because of social anxiety would you ever message them to apologize explain yourself and let them know why thing happened the way they did,anxiety783,im struggling with comment made recently by certain friend which surprised me and seem to confirm some of my fear about how i come across to others some example are below watching a sport event with friend and one of the athlete mess up  one of my friend say it like watching my name attempt small talk on holiday with two friend and after a trivial interaction one of them said before i met you i thought i hated talking to people the other agreed with him that i apparently hate talking to people i wa surprised by this a at least one of them is definitely le social than me same holiday one of the friend while drunk tell me you care so deeply about what other people think of you and they both say im the most unsure person theyve ever met whenever i make the slightest mistake or do something dumb saying i have dementia or alzheimers via nickname for me based on those term i cant come up with witty comeback every time especially if  people calling me it all at oncei think some of these comment are quite harsh exaggeration but the fact that this is how they see me still hurt me deeply i also cant imagine me saying this stuff to someone so there is an additional concern at how happy they are to disrespect meany advice ,anxiety784,is such a quiet and relaxing day empty street reheated food watching movie just being lazy and without worry after today routine and stress come back i start the final semester of college and i have to work on my thesis project search a place to do my internship find the money to pay college that now is more expensive and also all the graduation stuff just to get that damn

everywhere post give me serious anxiety  i feel anxious every time and i hate this  i hate myself i hate socializing because i dont trust anybody anymore  i have serious trust issue  i stay away from relationship because i am insecure about myself and i see lot of negative post about relationship and cheating and it make me seriously insecure  i am really suspicious and i keep doubting everyone around me  i am really really sensitive and every little thing make me anxious  even if i feel like suicidal  i think like i am weak and coward and cant face my fear  i see on social medium and news that something bad happened to somebody and i start over thinking like what if this happened to me  what would have i done in these kind of situation and i get really anxious  specially fighting somebody or having a situation where i have to fight believe me  i am really short tempered person and i dont give a sht about anyone when i am in anger but this overthinking sht is too much man  too much and the fact that everyone have anxiety and they still face them and fight them seriously making me doubt myself  i wish i could take my life and this whole saga just come to an end ,anxiety786,ive been sick for the past few monthsi just keep getting sickso ive done online schoolthe school had me do online school cu i get sick so oftenwith the exception of me going to school

starting and maintaining conversation so im scared itll be really awkward with long silence however im tired of playing alone all the time doe anyone have any tip for speaking to people online or a good way of finding people to play with,anxiety791,i think one factor thats contributed to the development of my social anxiety is the fear of not being distinct or intelligent enough ive tried picking up trait to make myself seem unique  change the way i speak alter my vocabulary dress only in a certain way or in a certain colour pick up this cool hobby read this unpopular book series but dont make yourself look like a try hard  take part in popular practice a well etc ive went a far a using mental illness a a mean of appearing le shallow to others and while thats a practice ive dropped i still havent discontinued the act of trying to look interesting and all ive always been called mature for my age but that feeling of superiority quickly subsided a i began browsing the internet and saw the amount of people far more brilliant than me child genius and all and yknow the realization that perhaps im not truly that mature when it come to all of the ugly and irrational thought i have  like this and the fact that i dont haveany friend my age at all since i go to an exclusively online school for a while i stopped expressing myself altogether because of the fear that my personality and thought were too trivial and shallow which made me seem even more shallow i know it truly doesnt matter all that much  i know i know were all distinct in our own way i know that we dont have to be the most brilliant in the room a long a were nice enough and pas the bar of basic intelligence and i know that im just worrying over nothing but i still just dont know how to start how do you come into term with not being all that special how do you stop trying to appeal to others how do you just be whoever you are how do you find who you are when all youve tried to be is something else where do you start,anxiety792,im full of anger rage and regret i fucking hate this life and i dont want to live it anymore get me tf out of here i live in my own imaginative wasteland of constant fear avoidance and confusion a to how to even make good connection all i do is fucking work and have never been in a legitimate relationship i need like  yr of paid vacation to sit think and maybe decide to branch out otherwise im stuck in this unforgiving loop of life draining work im lucky if i even make it to heaven without committing suicide ill be all like well here i am god life fucking sucked down there and i couldnt bear it a very unfulfilled lost cause waste of time and space i wa down there,anxiety793,it weird i always go back and forth between wanting to socialize and wanting to be on my own when im around people idk i cant think of anything to say at the same time im scared but i aint scared of what they think of me or nothing like that im scared of makin folk uncomfortable im scared that somethings about to go down and i gotta be ready for it it aint always like that though other time i just dont like people like everybody around me will just seem weird

year,anxiety796, introex social anxiety guy here obeseshake voice to the main character of the groupit took me the equivalent time of learning a whole new language from scratch s of hour of self improvementunfortunately the only way to get rid of social anxiety is to gradually expose yourself with event like these remember people are going to these event specifically to meet people so it not like your randomly intruding on someone friend groupthis guide should work in  of situation a long a enough people turn up at the eventampxb event selectiondownload the meetup app or find an event on the internetdepending on your social anxiety level pick either anime manga comic computer etc or language exchangei always pick language exchange i only know english and some basic phrase from a few

and put on cologne find a good one on fragrantica websiteput on  interesting item a conversation starter i like to use a cool hat and a necklace which ha some interesting design girl will almost always ask about it and you can talk for  minute about itnow the hard part write down around  thing you could possibly talk about when the dreaded moment of silence come it happens a lot luckily i have trained myself to always have a fallback conversation so the silence is like no more than  second the best one to break this are so tell me about somethingampxb the eventarrive there  minute early have a glass of wine or something before if you want just to be a bit le stiffnever arrive late you will be the odd guy trying to find group when their already having a convoif someone is standing in the queue or outside speak to them straight away you want to go into the event with someone it a lot harder going into a room by yourselfput away your coat and head to the bar straight away get an alcoholic or non alcoholic drink to hold in your handif you are a guy who want to speak to girl go talk to a few guy first unless you see a lonely girlwhat you want to do is establish basic friendlyness with guy first and then when you see girl looking around the room just wave at them and smile and say hellothe reason you want extra people around you is so you have le work to do when the conversation diesgirls can get away with not saying much simply because guy are kinda expected to do all the work it suck but it just how i found my experience to be hopefuly you find chatty onesampxb convo tipsok so here the thing drunk people energy is much higher so you have to match their energydrunk people also wont be able to have a deep intellectual conversationfrom my experience guy fall into  category the one that are very serious and want to talk about life travel adventure and nerdy shit and guy who just want to talk about getting laid you need to identify the vibe and just go with the flow these are the guy that like to say bro a lotalways state your own opinion and dont be afraid to disagree with people people respect thatif you want to avoid the dreaded why are you so quiet then always talk unless someone else isnever just grab a drink and sit on a wall you always want to be talking to someone if your group disbands then walk around until there an opportunity to talk to someone elsedont be afraid to intrude in an existing group it a meetup event i joined hundred of group and not a single time did someone act rude just insert yourself gracefuly

funnydont be upset if someone doesnt want to talk it could be a language barrierampxb example of a convoyo wasup where you guy frominsert countryoh heck yea insert countryoptional non offensive joke about the country i am not going to reveal my list of joke but they make people laugh and show my research into the countrythen you can talk about their country or your countryhow long are you staying heredo you like it herewhat do you think about comparison of countrieswow your english is amazing how long have you been studyingrandom stuff about language culture difference interesting factsrandom observation about the partyrandom story about your adventureshave you seen this movie or read this book etcdont bother name exchange until some of the convo ha happened or they ask for it it also a lot le awkward than doing it at the start however you can do it since it kinda common to do thatexchange social medium whenever you meet new people a long a basic convo ha happened already and name have been exchangedampxb advanced tacticsmerge group together let me introduce you to my friendif you speak to  people and they both speak the same language use that line and introduce themif you see a lonely shy social anxiety stuttering person in the corner speak to him and then introduce him to your or another group i made some amazing real friend that way their just too shy to speak to people

message them and ask if their doing anythingmost reply but only maybe  actually wanna do something another dayif they message you themselves then there clearly some interest and you did a good jobin a lot of these event i had to speak alone to like  to  girl for hour simply because they liked my vibe and the other guy were giving interview style question which bored them my only secret sauce is to keep it funny like silly story of how you got lost in another country or messed up the order with broken chinese etc a long a people are smiling their having a good time around you if you notice their eye wonder around the room it mean they are getting bored dont worry though just work on your social skill it can be learned i promise dont start with the deep endto start with just go to nerdy event where you can talk about anime or something it a lot easier that waygood luck everyone hope you make some nice friend,anxiety797,when im with people evenmrythinf is fine im enough of an extroverted introvert that im able to keep a conversation going if i want to but once im home thats where the anxiety sink in i start to think of every single thing i said and how it could be misinterpreted or potentially offensivehurtful in tbe most illogical way even if there no indication whatsover from the people i interacted with that ive upset them still i start thinking the person now judge me or doesnt like me it never been the case but im convinced i fucked up somehow i ruminate over these interaction so much that i wont sleep it drive me crazy and i dont know how to get over it without needing constant validation from the people i talked to who shouldnt have to constantly validate me because it not their job i feel like my anxiety got a lot worse after covid lockdown anyone else suffer with something similar,anxiety798,what are you trying to become better at,anxiety799,i hate being alone but i avoid social interaction a much a possible because i dont feel i fit in anywhere i just wish i wa like other people they make it look so easy this is year two of being completely alone going into the new year,anxiety800,hi guy i have pretty bad social anxiety mostly due to my heart pounding whenever i talk to someone im not super comfortable with ive been prescribed beta blocker propranolol which work suuper well like holy frick talking to people is x easier when you dont have a heart rate of bpm however ive noticed that my libido ha fallen off a cliff despite me not doing nofap which im almost certain is due to the beta blocker a theyre known to cause sexual dysfunctionmy question is if i stick to a running schedule to lower my resting bpm will this eliminate the need for me to take the blocker because my main problem with anxiety a i said is the high heart rate which cause me to talk fast avoid eye contact and just look and feel pretty uncomfortable lol also suck because when i notice it beating faster it just make me more anxious maybe if i lower my resting bpm that will in turn make it harder for me to get a super high heart rate thus lowering my anxietyany advicehelp is much appreciated lt,anxiety801,when people give me the slightest bit of aggression i believe theyre mad at me im not sure if this is a social anxiety thing trauma response or both my ex would ridicule me about everything i did wrong or they didnt like though ive always been afraid of rejection i think that relationship is affecting my new one i told this new person ive been hanging with that it felt like they were being a bit cold towards me they said that it their personality and i do agree that ive never seen them behave otherwise our friendship is still new though even their friend said so they tell me theyre being straightforward,anxiety802,it new year eve and i dont want to spend time with my family im not rude or anything but i feel isolated with them i feel like i dont fin in and my bad social skill make it worse i just sit quietly while they talk and it make me feel so awkward and dumb but anyway they dont even try to talk to me either so whatever,anxiety803,hiso i still do not know if i chose the right subreddit and correct me if i have written this in the wrong one i just need to put my thought somewhere a i am honestly too tired and need to vent a i keep not being able to sleep for probably  month i am a m that for the most part spends around  hour in one small room playing video game and watching movie i feel like i have hit the bottom mentally i have always been anxious and shy always had difficulty performing giving presentation reciting and other action that included presenting myself to a group of people i still sometimes stutter sweat my heartbeat is going so fast that i feel it is going to explode so i prefer to not take any participation in university project and i always do group term paper alone it is not like i have not tried anything chewing gum small stress ball in my pocket and even alcohol which sadly is the most efficient one but i have rarely  time resolved to using it i have the bad habit of biting my nail and even the skin around my nail and that habit ha made me go to the hospital twice so let say that habit is horrible a well the good thing is that i now bite my nail rarely and they look normal so i guess that is some progress i also limited my caffeine to around  cup of black tea per day not like before  cup of coffee  another  liter black tea and completely stopped fuzzy drink so that is also something that have done and i honestly do not feel physically drained from just walking anymore and yes i mention those habit because they are pretty much directly caused by my anxiety more or lessi also have a bad habit of when doing something like reading working on my laptop i tent to walk a lot around the apartment i talk about k recorded step inside a small apartment a day not being able to focus and remember thing such a name and event if not repeated at least  time and that is an entirely different thing but still if someone can give advice of how to control this it would be niceso now that i have talked about the my anxiety in term of individual problem now i want to talk about social anxiety i freaking cant make friend i am scared not confident in myself have low selfesteem and i am my biggest critic that look at my mistake and repeat them in my head again and again with the few friend i have and some of these friendship is basically one us the other and the opposite with no contact whatsoever between those situation another thing is that when i am alone and around me are people who i have never met or at least talked it is  little more easier to start a conversation when i am with a person i know tbh friend is something i still have no clear idea what is i hardly talk with other people while i watch othersfriends have no problem talking to random person when i see someone i know outside i will only greet them if i know the people around them and when i do not  they would get angry  they say that my excuse for them being with someone else is utter b i have tried numerous time to start a simple conversation ofc not forcing it like it is some kind of goal but it quickly becomes awkward af and i critic myself for being an idiot another thing to note is that i am completely different person behind a monitor and outside when i talk to someonei have tried numerous time training tennis football volleyball all sport that i enjoy and going to the gym that resulted in me picking up some pace only to drop it after like one and a half month though when i used to do this kind of activity i felt mentally perfect and i wa not angry sad not a much anxious and i wa not swearing a crap ton like nowi honestly am tired of not being able to talk with someone for some better topic than just what you did what you do what you drink what you work etc but i am also pretty much tired of being so anxious around people and though i want to change i simply cant and i swear i will go see some therapist no matter what other people thing if i am ok crazy etc and probably the continuous burnouts at work combined with uni took a toll on me for the past  year,anxiety804,i dont know if that this the wrong subreddit to post this on but if it the case im sorry and ill put it in another one also im sorry for my bad english  im an  year old man who ha trouble talking with girl back when i wa  ive had a crush on this girl but i never had the courage to talk to her nor even come to her to try and talk luckily my friend got in contact with her and thanks to him i wa able to talk with her sometimes my friend didnt know i had a crush on her in fact ive never told anyone that i had a crush on someone however when my friend wasnt around me i acted like i didnt see i know that one day she had waved to me but i pretended i didnt see her because i wa too scared to go talk to her thinking about this day i feel embarassed and like a shit  the thing is that this ha continued with the following year ive never went to talk to a girl and it wa either them who came to me or my friend being in contact with them that made me able to go talk to them recently around several month ago something like this happened i wa in a private discord server with my close friend and some of their female friend i wa pretty close to one let call her lea and we were laughing through message one day me and my friend had to go to our high school to get a certificate we were having fun and laugh for several hour and ive been informed that lea would join u very soon and i wa already stressing knowing my past when it come to talk to girl but since my friend were next to me i wasnt too stressed when lea arrived i wa immediately anxious i wa literally sweating and i couldnt be able to look at her in the eye i knew that if i would stay here any longer everyone would realise that im sweating so i had to think of an excuse to go back home i literally shaked hand with lea before leaving without even looking at her and left when i came back home lea wa pretty mad at me for ghosting her and i couldnt even find anything else other than i had to go im sorry  i dont even know what to do anymore i am the only person in my friend group who ha this all of my friend ha  problem when it come to talking to girl i feel like a shit i feel embarassed and i feel like an impostor im thinking about ending my life because at that point im just hurting the feeling of these girl and i feel insanely bad for doing so,anxiety805,i experience this a lot when meeting new people my friend have told me that they always thought i hated them when we first met because i would never hold eye contact with them or i seemed uninterested in the conversation a we were having it but it so far from the truth i dont even know what to tell them honestly i feel like you all understand how hard it is to maintain eye contact with other people so thats why i always look away im putting so much energy into not looking like im anxious and trying to keep the other person engaged in conversation that i forget to do the basic any remedy for this behavior or should i just accept it a a permanent part of my social anxiety and have you had any experience like this,anxiety806,i hate the moment when you have to felicitate the year to people that you know but you dont see in all the year,anxiety807,nothing hurt more than feeling like ok ive been progressing so much in trying to keep my social anxiety almost nonexistent progressing in social group and much

no one even thought to invite me i really thought i found my place at work and a group to be with but no it one thing for em to be mad at not being invited while theyre making plan in front of my face but the fact that my progress ive been making to try and be normal justdidnt matter in the end when it come to thing like this i have to accept that i am just different and not normal i really thought i found a placeaccepted but nope and to feel like this one new year eve it make me want to die im not even kidding one bit i put so much work and tear into working on my social anxiety and not only

after  year of largely ignoring my problem and throwing medication at them unsuccessfully and ive been going for almost a month and a half i wa doing okay with it but now that ive had this holiday week away from it ive had time to ruminate more fully on every past session and have come to the conclusion that i never should have opened my mouth everything i say is humiliating i think i must be my therapist stupidest client and i dont belong i want to run away i know the right answer is to bring this up in therapy and i know my thought arent necessarily the truth but i genuinely dont know how to make myself return next week,anxiety818,do an accent seriously nobody gonna know it doesnt even have to be foreign you could do an accent from the same country youre in but a different area i

and the people i talk to with them dont know theyre not real unless i tell them,anxiety819,i cant seem to stop myself from spiraling over relatively minor issue im not sure what it is but i seem to crave validation and acknowledgement from damn near anyone i see i get sad or anxious if the security guard at the door to my work doesnt nod or say hi to me i get sad if the cleaner ignore me i get sad if im outside vaping and other people vaping give me weird or piercing look or indicate with their body language that they dont want to talk i get upset if i say hi to someone and they respond with a noncommittal nonverbal response like a nod or a quick smile greeting or making eye contact with people is just something i permanently associate with anxiety now  i spend hour analyzing every interaction i have and what i couldve done i chastise myself for not being more vocal if people do rude thing like not moving out of the way if youre trying to get out of an elevator the other day this random woman gave me this weirdfrightenedangry look a i wa walking past her to get to the elevator she came out of and i just felt like the biggest piece of shit in the world ive somehow developed an unhealthy attachment to thinking the only way i can gain acceptance and acknowledgment is by losing weight and dressing better or by somehow being a different race i think i am really sick people just looking at me slightly wrong is enough to ruin my day,anxiety820,usually people spend new year eve with large gathering at a party etcim just here by myself is this

growing up i wa pretty carefree and confident and often got kind compliment about my charisma and aura i always felt liked wanted and comfortable and wa always being invited and welcomed place but partway into college some pretty nasty thing happened to me where people i trusted just mauled my identity and selfconfidence and ive developed what i can only assume must be pretty bad social anxiety i say pretty bad because im usually one to push off any selfdiagnosis and hate to throw around the word trauma or ptsd but at this point it become so apparent that i think i have to admit it to be something psychological i started work earlier this week and i dont think ive ever felt like ive botched a first impression but this week i feel like my anxiety and low selfesteem just rocketed out i shut down all my expression and talk really slow but i still stuttered i used to be a debater just to contextualize my demise and struggled to make eyecontact i dont introduce myself when new people enter the room and dont speak unless spoken to i overthink everything i say before i say it and my hesitation to speak and take physical action show i dont know what to do to fix this any help would be greatly appreciated,anxiety823,out at the pub with my so family we sat down at a table of my choice and then to my horrora waitress come over and say sorry these table are takeni stand up ready to go only to see no one else ha stood in fact they are talking to the waitressyou see they are actually good friend and this is just a little joke they havesafe to say i sat back down and felt all eye on mei want to sink into my chair,anxiety824,i have diagnosed ocd and wa once diagnosed with bipolar type  then undiagnosed and diagnosed again but never took med or anything i dont think im episodic enough to meet the criterion for that diagnosis however i do have episode of rage which i think are perhaps in line with that diagnosis i wa also diagnosed with social anxiety disorder im not on any med though they have been prescribed to me i have an ocd fear of them part of my ocd anyways to get to the point sometimes i find myself acting hostile towards people when im usually very meek and passive but sometimes i feel like people step all over me im a mildly attractive slim petite white woman and i feel like because im only  not super young but not old or people people dont really respect me or show me any kind of courtesy that they grant others anyways i wa in the grocery store parking lot today and i wa trying to cross it a rainy day and this car kept going even though they saw me and i said can you please stop can i please cross thank you kind of sarcastically and then they told me it wa a man to go f myself and then i told him if you write back and that youre the one who practically ran me over when im in the crosswalk but i wa shaken up by that i saw a clerk who getting the cart staring at me strangely and the store manager greeted me kind of fondly when i walked in like they thought i wa crazy and i probably did look crazy but i get so tired of people pushing me around both figuratively and literally i noticed when im out with my daughter who  people are more respectful because they see that im a mother or maybe i just am more cautious also when im with my elderly mother i notice the stark difference she ha mobility issue and her need for courtesy is obvious so they definitely show her more grace and courtesy than they do me but i just wish that people could be respectful to me alone and i wonder what it is about me that people think they dont have to respect sometimes i think i get stared at that other time like this i feel completely invisible and insignificant like people think they can just run me down this kind of stuff happens to me all the time maybe im overthinking it maybe this happens to everyone but today i just kind of snapped and it not the first time i get so used to holding thing in that i finally let it out on one random stranger but i dont really feel guilty because he melt off to me right back when he could have just ignored me and he should have let me go honestly it just really disturbed me that he decided to tell me off back because it just show that people are not nice to me and they dont give me any respect during the store i wa having an anxiety attack that everyone heard and everyone knew i kept hearing maybe he would slash my tire i dont even know if he saw the vehicle i came out of but still i kept fearing that he would park and confront me or beat me up i wa practically shaking while shopping have you ever experienced something similar,anxiety825,i walk my dog x a day and i swear every time coming up and going down recently i have been running into multiple people on my floor

back downstairs to retrieve my package from the building amazon hub i would be taking the stair and avoiding the elevator how painful could it be well after i took my package out some lady with her dog asked me if that wa her package i said no it is mine wtf how could it possibly be yours please just stop talking to me when i got off on my floor i saw the person who life across hall from me and wa taking forever to open her door so i had no choice but to just go ahead and unlock my door it sound crazy but i dont like people seeing me enter or exiting my apartmenti know it is selfish and unreasonable of me to expect not to run into people there are over  apartment in my building and  apartment on my floor alone but i feel like i am always running into people and no one else doe it just how i feel ,anxiety826,hello i am a college student in my last year i suffer from serious social anxiety low self esteem and low confidence issue i spent my past  year in college sitting in my

about  month nowi feel bad and im kinda debating on just messaging them a hi and apologizing for ghosting them but idk,anxiety833,there this guy at work that i want to talk to but i whenever i do i come off a blunt cold or disengaged lol this guy is actually the older brother to another coworker who i grew close with and ive already met him a few time before he started working here the thing with me is in the beginning i can function just fine but if i have to have consistent interaction with someone i start becoming this avoidant person because i dont mentally and physically know how to maintain the same energy i first gave off it like my brain go this is getting too real forming relationship cant have that requires too much talking and eye contact and so i almost selfsabotage myself by becoming this cold person and pushing people away when deep down thats obviously not what all of u want im not even looking for a romantic relationship but it would be so nice to feel comfortable enough to talk to a guy for once since im close to his sister i thought it would be easier for me but it not he a sweet guy and ha given me a few compliment but yet i still see him a a threat because of my social anxiety this whole week we didnt talk much at work because i wa avoiding him and so even he stopped coming to me for small talk i saw him yesterday and said are you okay youre so quiet in a serious tone while internally screaming at myself to lighten up and he wa like well no one is talking to me talk to me  and i just laughed and walked away a i usually do because i dont know what to say i actually sent him an apology text because of how i wa acting lately and asked him if the word i have said affected him he said he wasnt bothered too much by it and playfully said we can grab lunch or dinner sometime to make up if you want which i completely freaked out about i told him about my social anxiety and he said aside from the short conversation we have had he never would have known he told me he didnt want me to feel bad for the way i wa acting and so i explained to him that i hope he doesnt take it personal and wished him a happy new year now i have to see this guy monday and i feel like quitting lol im starting to think i should have never apologized and brought my social anxiety up in the first place i hope this doesnt make thing awkward but my anxiety make me fear it will be even though i know he is a nice guy and wouldnt make fun of me for it overthinking is annoyiiiiiinggggg i really need to push myself and talk more because my socially anxious self isnt the real me yet thats what most people are getting,anxiety834,there nothing more to say,anxiety835,i wa invited to my aunt surprise birthday party mind you i havent seen my distant family in  year since my dad funeral im not close with them ive avoided every invite out because i know i would be the center of attention and i no longer have my dad to cling to i have to be present and social i finally agreed to the invite because it her birthday so no one should focus on me outside of my initial entrance i figured that if i show up at the same time a everyone else then i will have no big entrance into the party moment i wont have to deal with everyone looking at me and trying to greet me while putting on a fake smile the entire time and being interviewed about where ive been and what ive been up to for the last two year and repeating the same thing to everyone that i talk to if i show up right during the surprise everyone will forget about me and move on that wa the plan well unfortunately i had stomach issue driving to the party and had to turn around to go home and fix myself up the party wa  mile away once i felt better and started driving back to the party it had already started i waste  minute of my life to drive there park alongside the street walk up to the door and decide there way too many people inside and i dont want my presence announced when i walk in i felt too anxious went back to my car took a few minute to decide if i could handle going inside and suddenly had a full bladder now i need to quickly decide do i go inside and sprint to the restroom or speed home i sped home and put my phone on do not disturb what a waste of time and gas,anxiety836,i kinda like the way i am online texting and am able to keep the conversation going im funny and have interesting take last month i wa invited for the first time to study together with a colleague but i rejected it because we had only talked through whatsapp and i knew i would be a disaster if we actually met in persongod it suck being socially anxious,anxiety837,one for me is im from the uk and wa in a new city a few hour away from mine ive gotten quite good at talking to cashier and wa telling the cashier how i wa from out of the area but i loved it here and how great i wa finding the place her accent didnt match the area though and she sound like she lived closer to my area so i asked if she moved here recently thing is she had south asian heritage so what i meant is what i asked if she moved to this city recently from somewhere else in the uk but i realised it probably seemed like i wa asking where are you from no where are you really from after a brief pause she told me she wa from london originally but moved to this city earlier that year i am so glad she understood what i meant but in that pause i think her mind went through the same thought process mine did and i just always cringe a that make me so uncomfortable i never wanna come across like that kind of personanother le awkward one for me but i am potentially on the autism spectrum im super bad with social cue and taking intention from thing people say i just need to be told thing directly one time i wa with a friend and we met someone she knew after talking for about  minute he said im michael fake name by the way and i went cool after an awkward pause everyone got talking again i found the pause weird so i sat thinking about it then i realised he said his name because he expected me to say mine afterward so i kinda almost screamed oh im kieran and they both just laughed not maliciously though my friend knew what i wa like and just laughed by understanding how i think i learned after that to say your name if someone else say theirs,anxiety838,i wa walking home with a bunch of friend when a friend of ours waved in our direction i couldnt tell if he wa waving at me or at my other friend who i knew him through so i just stood there helplessly i didnt wave back or even smile even though he made eye contact with me and waved some morei know he probably think i wa being rude to him but i really just have the habit of freezing under stress should i apologize to him or should i not mention it and move on,anxiety839,i just want to say english is not my first language maybe some sentence are not well written i wa a bit anxious and i preferred not to go to large holiday gathering because the last time i went to a christmas party with a lot of guest that i didnt know much about i wa over analyzing the conversation for like a week my issue is that im afraid of people judgement especially people who dont know me much i am afraid of misunderstanding im afraid that people think bad of mei could not get away from the in law family gathering  his cousin uncle aunt  last time i felt people didnt like me and kind of ignored me  i came in his grandma house i greeted everyone the people who ignored me last time i didnt make the effort to go talk

without conversation if were watching a group learning video im constantly wondering what arm movement should i do next am i standing too still and usually standing in one spot around a lot of people feel really awkward so i usually find the first thing to lean up against it not that i cant still for awhile it just more comfortable and i get nervous standing around a bunch of people my leg forget that their leg i cant even walk or eat normally around people ive been told i walk funny i feel like im walking funny but it hard for me when walking past or around people because again i get so focused on hand movement and if im walking funny again i end up doing it kind of like a limp when im eating around people which is usually never now cause i eat in my car on break my neck would always stiffen up lifting the food or drink to my mouth causing my head to slightly shake and i felt like people would notice that,anxiety841,i sincerely hope everyone in this subreddit make progress on defeating their social anxiety and find more people who understand themxoxorandom guy with social anxiety,anxiety842,wa out at a new year party with a group of friend and my crush wa there apparently when there lot of people around i have no problem flirting innocently with my crush in a group setting where we can playfully banter around with each other and other people everything feel lighthearted and fun but once we get the chance to get closer be alone and talk to each other oneonone this odd dread and pressure take over me and i start to panic inside i suddenly act avoidant and withdrawn and awkward which is the exact opposite of what i want to convey i dont know what to say to him and would try desperately to get another friend to just come in between u and divert the awkwardness trying to work through this issue but cant figure where to start anyone else face this problem before,anxiety843,a someone with social anxiety i feel like the world biggest hypocrite i want to be a more patient and sensitive person but i just dont think im quite there last night i went on a date that i didnt really know for sure wa a date until i got there anyway it wa chill and i wa totally fine with it being a date we grabbed some food together and i finished my food first the person i wa on the date with ill call her k apologized for taking longer to finish i told her it wa fine but she just kept apologizing over and over again and she would apologize for other thing that were entirely nonissues a well i understand that she wa coming from a good place but having to constantly reassure her wa very exhausting for me and also made me feel awkward or like i wa doing something wrong to make her feel the need to apologize so profusely   also not too long ago i went out to a bar not a a date with someone i had met up with a few time prior we were both very crossfaded and hence a little out of it they just kept over analyzing everything though they would read way too deeply into my facial expression my mannerism etc they also remarked on awkward silence when i literally wa just spacing out because i wa beyond fucked up even when i would explain this stuff to them they would keep pushing i explained that i wa just really crossed but apparently i didnt seem crossed to them and i actually have a separate story of something like this happening with another socially anxious person but ill spare yall it actually kind of ironic cause i feel like a lot of u with social anxiety fear other people judging u but i generally feel a lot more judged by socially anxious people than people who dont noticeably struggle with social anxiety i just hate feeling like i have to play some role for someone instead of just being myself ive also made a decent amount of progress when it come to my social anxiety it still a problem but not to the extent it used to be so when im around someone who is very socially anxious i just feel like im regressing back to a version of myself that i dont like very muchi just feel so guilty because i know that i have a lot of mental issue and can be very exhausting to be around myself which probably make me even more of a hypocrite i just cant do it though,anxiety844,yesterday i went to a club with some friend and the reality hit me that while staying at home the majority of my life i hadnt practiced any social skill i have been diagnosed with body dysmorphia and some other thing like a year ago i would like to think i improved a little since then i dont think im ugly anymore but even when i feel pretty talk to people act confident dress nicely do makeup all that and still no bitch i am nice to people and respect them am i just doomed for life of course i dont think im the best person alive but i have some confidence that im not unattractive everyone ha told me thats how you get men it seems no matter how hard i try i am just doomed to be ugly and disgusting i feel really obnoxious to be honest lol,anxiety845,how wa your year view pollhttpswwwredditcompollzztavf,anxiety846,so for my entire life up until th grade ive had no interest in socializing with people but i started feeling socially starved for human connectionskip to now i have many friend that i love very dearly but the problem is that i feel like our relationship are very one sidedas in we are friend inside the school but not outside it and we dont have a many interaction a i wish we could havebut here the real problem my friend dont wanna go out with me usually nor do they invite me to most of their hangoutsso i thought that communication would be the best option here so i did that and communicated with  of my friend and told me that i feel left out and that i wanna hang out with them  of them said theyd start inviting me to stuff but the third one said something that bothered me he said it just a phase that we all go through and that i should ask out other people and he mentioned two other people and said that i should hang out with them instead witch bothered me because why not hang out with you guy why these other peopleand after that they only invited me to hang out twice for playing football where many people where there too so it wasnt very personal  they hang out together littarly once a week sometimes more but they never invite me like at all one of them invited me to play basketball once and i got excited but then he told me it wa a joke what kind of joke is thatanyway i love texting them i do it all the time i like to check on my friend and how theyre doing and i also like to help them with school work but here the thing my friend littarly never text me first like ever not even a single time unless it for school work help where i will receive a ton of message about iti have this one friend i texted him every single day of summer break from the start of may to the end of july no joke i loved him so much because he so nice and kind to everyone i would show him everything that i would be doing and sending him pic and video but one day i stopped when school began and guess how many time he texted me after that zero zero timeshe even had a birthday party and didnt invite me despite the fact that i talked with him everyday  helped him with school work like im not saying im obligated to be invited but it wouldve been nice i mean i even asked him to go out with me  separate time but he keep saying he busy so why not invite me to your birthday partyi see my friend hanging out together on instagram i have a big anger sadness attack and i spend the entire day being upset and feeling bad about not being with them my friend keep saying to me that sometimes or rather most of the time   i cant come with them because theyre being invited by someone who didnt invite me and it would be rude for them to request me being invited but like i had one of them over to my house once and he requested for someone else to come so theyre being hypocrite they just dont care about me i keep forgiving my friend for all this but i feel like im experiencing some sort of splitting with them  a in i would go from adoring them to despising them to adoring them again i hate it when they dont appreciate me but i love it when they do witch is rarei give them everything i have and yet they return nothing,anxiety847,today i wa sure that i have social anxiety i have

known for a long time ive been friend with people for a couple of year and am technically part of a friend group but the problem is is that i dont really feel like myself around these people they are so kind and inclusive to me which i hate is the problem i feel like i always have to be polite to them so ive never felt  comfortable around them i feel like were only friend because theyre being nice and not because they value me a a friend mostly because ive never been my authentic self around them i wish thing would change and that theyd start to take me le seriously so we could form deeper relationship but it seems like no matter what they still have that perception of me that make them think they have to be kind and polite to me all of my friendship are like this and it really affected my perception of my own personality because i become a pretty boring person when im around my friendsafter hearing about people struggle with social anxiety ive still never heard of anyone else

and the other is a speech class now i already took the drug class this year but when i go back to school i have to go to speech class where you supposedly have to write and do speech in front of the whole class i have truly no friend in that class and for the pa month or so the prospect of having to talk in front of the whole class ha been eating me from the inside i dont know what to do,anxiety862,this is just my experience and honestly im not sure if it fit here but i dont know where else to put it im not saying some girl dont have trouble getting date off apps im just saying in my opinion it a lot more difficult for guy to get attention obviously i dont have a proper point of reference because ive never been a woman thoughi just dont understand what people want i like to think im a relatively attractive guy if a bit skinny im definitely not ugly i rarely get any attention on apps and honestly at this point they feel like a waste of time im honestly just really fucking lonely and i dont know how else to meet people im trying to date again after taking a month or two off from it because i had some really awful experience my girlfriend of almost five year whom i loved with all my heart left me a few month ago and i just feel so fucking lost and lonely most of the match i do end up getting they never even bother to reply to my first message those that do most stop messaging me after one or two message ive tried asking them out on a date early in the conversation and ive also tried just messaging for a while to get to know them first and neither have gotten me any luck the few people i do end up matching with and meeting havent worked out and like i mentioned ive had some awful experience the one i have met have turned out to be profoundly mentally ill even more so than myself which i think is really saying something to be honest  i dont have any idea how to meet people in real life so this feel like my only option but it just doesnt work out if you have any advice feel free to share i guess i just need to know im not alone in feeling this way it just make me sad and im afraid ill be alone forever,anxiety863,okay so boom i wa at a cousin wedding

girlfriend is what i want most in the future i am grateful for the progress i have made this month in overcoming my social anxiety and making new connection and i am excited to meet new people at university and eventually achieve this goal however i am feeling a little down because i dont know how long it will take despite this i am hopeful for the future and all the amazing experience it may bring,anxiety866,i missed out on most thing my teenage and early s life partly due to sa now im  look a bit older than i am but from what i have had for experience and want my life to be i feel like  at mosti really just want cute first experience with the other sex and stuff but i look like someone who youth ha already run out it make me not feel like myself it make me hate everything it make me unable to behave how i want to even when getting over my anxiety because it would feel out of place to everyone else  is it just over for me have i failed in life already is it just never ending pain from now on,anxiety867,so i thought i might drop this here im too embarrassed to tell anyone irl also i wish id heard this kind of story when i wa doing my job search it kind of funny actuallyi interned at a big company recently by faking an extroverted personality during interview and some luck however it became very apparent very quickly how anxious and awkward i wa at one point it wa found out that i dont have any friend  the reaction wa kinda like are you kidding me with this kid really embarrassing i wa told people on the team pity me that this will really hold me back and these are some very well accomplished people every day i went home and felt like i wa going crazy with anxiety my social interaction i kept to the absolute bare minimum however i worked very hard  and now i have a return offer  hopefully with better social skill nowmoral of the story being a hard worker and reliable can go a long way apparently im very thankful to have learned thisbecause one of my biggest and maybe irrational concern wa that no matter how hard i work my social skill would deter me from finding a good job now im even wondering if i can find a place to work where people are more accepting of my anxiety and introversion,anxiety868,so i like to play video game to calm down and sometimes i play online game i am fine with game where you play with other people but cannot chat with them but in game with chat function i am always scared to play online i think i am just afraid i will do something wrong and the person i am playing with will get upset and i also dont know how to end an interaction i dont know what to say when i want to stop playing with someone so i usually just get scared and just leave the lobby which is probably rude but i dont know what else to do the problem is i enjoy playing with other people like that but i just dont know how to manage the interaction a long a they dont say anything it fun but the moment i have to start chatting with them i get scared so i just stop playing i also feel bad when i try to play because the people im playing with are so nice and i can barely talk to them because im scared they deserve better coop partner than meanyone else with sa who also play online game how do you overcome this,anxiety869,in the past i wa such a happy kid i had alot of friend really social maximizing every thing out of life no care of the real world of anythingbut then idk what happened maybe it wa me growing up or corona that did this but i started to feel motivated i started my self improvement journey i broke up with my girlfriend lost  percent of all my friendsstarted to hate my self push my self to the limit and abuse myself at failure i just started to procastinate and day dream alot lost all confidence became fat and ugly started to feel my life is ending at just  lost all my saving to crypto started failing class no grooming just nothingnow i have no money no friend im afriad to talk to woman hence no girlfriend im failing class have no passion no motivation to do anything and i just dont want to change anymore i just want to go back in time and start it all over again,anxiety870,so i asked this really pretty girl out in my hostel she rejected meso a few month later i garnered enough confidence and texted this other girl and she replied with ok and then blocked menow everytime i see these girl around in college i just try to hide from them or just put my head down and pas by them i dont know whyand since then i gave it one more shot because growing up with serious anxiety and zero friend i thought this wa my best bet at putting my self out there the third girl i asked looked at me didnt reply and walked away and i dont know now should i laugh at how pathetic i am or cry at how pathetic i am,anxiety871,not sure if this is just a me problem due to year of feeling so insecure about myself and now it all just gotten worse but basically the title doe anyone else feel really embarrassed and uncomfortable around people who look you know are much better than you look better than you andor are around your agei went to work and met another team member thats been here way longer than me i just didnt get the chance to meet her until today who looked around my age and she wa so pretty sociable and confident i instantly felt really angry overwhelmed upset and insecure all day she really triggered me because i didnt like how everyone else wa talking to her laughing with her not at her like they all do with me and overall shes well likedi havent been at this job for long so i dont have all the answer it wa embarrassing today when i wa stuck on something with a customer and i had to inturrupt the rest of them mid conversation to ask for help i could feel myself going bright red a i never got an immediate response i look over to the group thats standing around chatting to then say hey sam can you help not real name btw or hey guy and theyre all purposely ignoring me i then apologise to the customer and say sorry about that one for the customer to laugh at me and say it ok at this point im holding back tear just ready to walk out on the spot it fucking embarrassing i had to take frequent break in the back to try and collect myself counting to  and all that shit although it didnt work what would you do if you wa me,anxiety872,so ive always been like this irrespective of the contexti wanted to ask this really cute girl in my class who really popular and we share common friend but i never could i wa never scared of her rejecting me but i wa scared of what if she told our common friend and the whole college about this they see me a a desperate creep or a loserokay moving on i thought about starting a youtube channel and content creation in general because i saw on daily basis how people in my college who made online content people made fun of them hated on them and they were seen a weridos which really broke my moral againwhy do i care so much about other people opinion of me,anxiety873,so im texting a old coworker and im trying to make him a friend but he is kind of a dry texter when ever i ask something he doesnt seem to do much outside of his interest video game mineral and kind of nerdy stuff i had thought he just wasnt interested but i have com to the conclusion that he just introverted how do i keep the conversation interesting like you could only talk about video game and etc for so long,anxiety874,how did you find being under the  spotlight,anxiety875,so it no shock a lot changed since  but for me ive become so isolated so ive lost contact with my friend and in  itself i wa set to go into a new school college i didnt like my old friend a they werent for me and i wa with them to not be alone  and they all went to different college so i thought i would be making new friend in college but  year went by and i didnt and ended up staying at home most of the time because i suffer horrendous social anxiety now im really lost am i going to be like this forever i regret ghosting everyone but people outgrow others and it normal im struggling on my own any advice ,anxiety876,so ive been having a hard time finding a job i apply to a lot of place but i never seem to get a response for some reason ive recently just given up because of lack of motivation and social anxiety and it been weighing on me a lot i feel terrible not having one but cant bring myself to put in effort anymore and in the brief period i get motivation i still get no response nearly everyone at my grade level ha a job already and i still dont and it not like i have the excuse of being busy i hardly interact with family or have any obligation outside of the house so i have a lot of free time it isnt like im too caught up in school to get one because i dont get much work from school and my grade are pretty good despite me not putting much effort into it anymore so there isnt much of an excuse for me to not have one i feel terrible now when i receive christmas and birthday money i always say that i never worked for it or earned it so i hardly spend it at all and i know the only one holding me back is myself and it really my fault i cant do anything in my life im not even sure about my future to be honest which i suppose is normal for someone my age i dont really have any friend to talk to or hang out with either so i hardly leave the house and i just sit on my phone most of the day which suck ive been trying to do something with myself like participate in volunteering at school which would also provide volunteer hour for a college scholarship but i dont want to show up and be the only person there that doesnt know anybody ive tried to start working out and getting a better diet to hopefully gain weight and muscle but i always fall short every hobby i try to pick up always get dropped other than occasionally drawing there isnt many place to go to in my little town either so im kinda stuck here also sorry that this rant got way off topic but these are the only time i get to share these feeling,anxiety877,how do i cope around my bf family and friend im shy and get nervous in any social situation especially group of people how do i enjoy myself without putting pressure on myself  i dont have much to say to them and vice versa but i dont wanna come off cold do i just sit there on my phone or cuddle with bae f ,anxiety878,he treated him differently than others he wa always treated differently compared to others  of course  he rationalized  no one would be treated the same since everyone is different  how could he objectively judge and generalize something that would be different and ever changing in every instant every day  dependent on mood on circumstance  on trait on so many thing the behavior of people could not be generalized  every rational part of his brain told him however it wa the same brain that conducted that he wa being treated different than others in many circumstance why would she not talk to me the same way she doe to others always so cheerful  so talkative  except in front of me why would he be so cold when it just the two of u he not like that usually  why doe he tell him thing he never told me thing of importance i would have liked to know  but only just overheard accidentally a he wa enthusiastically conversing with him in a way he would never converse with me maybe i did something wrong maybe i am somehow  wrong my whole existence  my whole lifehe knew that he had past experience causing him to think and feel a certain way  or at least biasing him  making him doubt  pushing him to think like that so how then could he judge it every time his brain did the judging part for him he tried to eradicate the thought somehow it didnt make sense it could be anything really  maybe some people just dont fit together maybe i dont fit with most people maybe bad mood maybe  maybe there were too many variable  so he did not dare allow his judgement to consolidate how could he he thought of his ability to think highly at least it wa the only thing he liked about himself really even that disappeared from time to time a he wa simultaneously all the time convinced that something wa wrong and after carefully assessing that there wa nothing really wrong  he concluded that it must be his mind  his very foundation  that wa inherently corrupted however he still liked to hold on to that conviction  it wa his safe haven there wa absolutely nothing else giving him any confidence he hated his body  he hated his age he hated the time he lived in in this miserable world doomed to collapse  he hated feeling this way and finally  he hated himselfwhy is my life worth living if there is nothing worth living my life for  i look like an actual fucking monkey with hair all over my place  ive exercising a lot but i still fucking hate my body i cant interact with others properly without feeling like crap i cant do thing i actually want to do without feeling too lazy to do it and then feel bad about myself can i be happy for once  just happy not this ambivalent shit all the time it no wonder people treat me differently  they notice it somehow  maybe not consciously  but on a subconscious level surely how could anyone like this fucked up piece of shithe knew that he wa in this strange self fulfilling cycle at least he thought he knew  but he could still not be sure  maybe it wasnt a cycle leading downwards maybe it wa just life maybe it just this day maybe he ate something bad he could not be sure he could not actso he sat there near him and kept quiet he had tried to initiate conversation once  maybe twice  now he wa quiet he didnt want to disturb him maybe he didnt want to talk he didnt know what to say maybe that wa the problem  if he said the right thing the right way would it flow  he did not know  he could not be sure  so he kept quiet  a he feared that every other failed attempt at solving what he perceived a a problem would hurt him so much moreso he kept quiet this feeling  he knew it so well his whole life not being worth someone attention  not being worth a discussion  not being worth talked to not being worth smiled atworthless a subhumanthis is something i wrote in a time of distress  hope you liked reading it,anxiety879,when you know youre having an anxiety attack and you can

very outgoing and talkative and asks me a lot of stuff but my brain freeze and i dont know how to respond properly he even asked me if im usually this serious i tried breathing technique but in that moment i just cant relax my muscle get so tensed this also happens when im in big group of people  i also tried taking medication that can help me relax and handle the situation better but it didnt work at all this make me feel so awful about myself sometimes and  frustrated that i just cant be myself,anxiety886,in past i have been a socially awkward guy with weird personalityfrom somewhere i

to worry about plus were doing pres at my friend accomadation first and then again at another girl place and i really just hope they dont do any drinking game because my anxiety cant take something like that,anxiety896,removed,anxiety897,note im leaving out a lot of detail about why this yeartime of year ha been hard because i dont want to write a book but if you want more context leave a comment saying so and ill give it to youmy family is great but sometimes i hate spending time with them because they are all much more successful and happy than i am this is one of those timesthis year ha been extremely hard on me and im in a really low spot i dont need to be reminded of how inadequate and miserable i am compared to people i share a lot of dna with so all month ive literally been worrying myself sick about an upcoming gettogetherill stay up all night worrying give myself head and stomach ache and my heart will beat so hard that i can feel and hear it i have felt nauseated at some point on most day and have had to stop what im doing and take deep breath to get back to normali know ill start to feel a lot better if i can just avoid this obligation altogetherheres the hard part though i live in the house where the gettogether is being held and i cant use work a an excuse to not be there what can i do to avoid this situation i have no problem with staying locked up in my bedroom the whole timei just need a good excuse to be able to do so,anxiety898,and if so do you recommend any alternative that actually provide similar level of energy thank you,anxiety899,ive noticed this in a number of situation they all have in common that i trust myself more when im with friendsfor example a buddy is spontaneously with me over new year eve and today we went to a caf it wa really refreshing and comfortable despite the many people and the unfamiliar situation i made it i even managed to ask the waitress where the entrance to the caf is and what they have to offerwithout my good buddy i would not have done this  and avoided the situation like many othersi think it would help me a lot if i had more friend if i knew more people to do stuff withbut thats the paradox of sad i guess,anxiety900,my social anxiety ha reached an all time high i used to isolate myself for short period where i wouldnt answer anyone at all these period started getting longer and now i am seriously jeopardizing my friendship and relationship to my family it go so far that i cant even answer my grandmother let alone my friend because i get so overwhelmed i really want to try get back in touch with some friend i have neglected for a long time now i know i hurt them with my silence but i just dont know how to explain myself let them know it not about them and that i do want them in my life i dont want to come across like a depressed loser though  what can i say or do,anxiety901,ive f been seeing this guy and weve had four date he really understanding and we talk about everything he know i have zero previous experience my problem is i feel like ill never be comfortable enough to do it i think ill explode if i have to take my clothes off or even his have you ever gone successfully through that and how long did it take you,anxiety902,this past year i met someone at work and weve been dating about  month it been really wonderful and ive told them about my anxiety a well a that im currently off my medication long story  cant find the right fit this year we are introducing each other to our family it make me feel like a freak they come from a large like massive catholic family and theyre really close with all their cousin not only am i anxious to begin with but every get together it card game or board game ive never played and theyve all been playing with each other for year i feel stupid i feel embarrassed and above all else im not religious so i feel like im walking on eggshell so i dont mess up yesterday wa supposed to be a very chill end of year board game night with their cousin and i had to excuse myself to cry in the bathroom three time i feel like a freak i just want to be normal i feel like every time i do anything it those comic depiction in movie where the camera pan to everyone staring at you deadpan one of the worse part is their brother brought home a girl from their religious college and of course she get along with everyone effortlessly and know their prayer i really thought i could do this kind of thing this year but i feel like a freak cry at their family function im sure if we break up i will be the laughing stock for year  remember that girl you would bring that would cry at everything yikes my so is understanding and caring but they have admitted they dont really understand it just kind of make me feel alone and pathetic thank you for reading my rant i just wanted to vent to people who could understand im really tired of cry,anxiety903,ive been wanting to make online friend for a while but first of all i dont really know how and secondly i have literally zero social skill and dont really understand how to act in social situation which just make me come across a boring and awkward im just tired of having no one to play game with or to talk about my interest with,anxiety904,i dont know what im interested in all i do know is that working in retail would be too hard for me,anxiety905,removed,anxiety906,i probably just sound like an attention seeker but hopefully it might inspire other people to do the same the past couple of month i have been getting out more and getting used to the real world i wa essentially a shutin but not really doing any social interaction when going out the other day i went shopping with my mum and i paid for thing myself usually i give my mum the money and ask her to buy it for me since im scared of talking to the person at the cash register im terrible at math so i often get the amount wrong when i pay with cash so it became a fear of mine to buy thing myself but i did it and it went smoothly then yesterday i went by myself to a shop to buy some basic thing like milk and vegetable i wa shaking so much because i go with my mum everywhere so i felt lost being by myself with no one to rely on to do social interaction for me i cant remember the last time i went somewhere by myself aside from school i must have been a young teenager im  now i couldnt make eye contact with anyone in the shop and i couldnt speak except for thank you bye but i still managed to buy some thing instead of giving up and going home im scared of going back but i will try i dont feel like i can go everyday yet but maybe once or twice a week it can get better guy but it is scary i have to be honest im not asking for praise or attention i just wanted to share the experience like a diary on the internet lol maybe i will write again when i go again,anxiety907,im scared to meet up with friend and generally scared to plan up to meet with anyone purely because im scared that they will see im nervous and the more i think about it before meeting up the more nervous i get especially scared of my voice shaking im  and never had this in my life before the recent  monthsim not scared of being in public or talking to stranger and i dont care what anyone think about mehow do i fix this planning on starting lexapro,anxiety908,it seems that everyone like animal whether they have pet or not,anxiety909,hello it me again i had a panic attack in the middle of training at a job the same thing happened at a different place literally  week ago and i lost that opportunity so this would be the second time anyways i panicked yesterday and had to leave immediately but i made up an excuse and said i would show up today i dont think i can do it i dont want to see those people again i dont have the gut im pretty sure ill end up panicking againwhat i feel right now is a mixture of fear embarrassment and lack of motivationhonestly i dont see myself working there i dont think i would end up getting hired and if i did i dont see myself lasting shit but i wanted to finish the training just to feel good about myself and here we are now im burritoed in a blanket and im petrified i dont want to move i feel so unprofessional,anxiety910,i feel really alone in this why cant i speak why cant i find the right word in the moment this is honestly the one of the worst thing tip of the tongue phenomenon or saying something else from what u were thinking why doe every social interaction feel like a test im bound to fail why do i when i overcome the fear and speak but nothing i say make sense there is no coherence to my thought when spoken out loud do i really make thing hard for people to understand when speaking out suddenly i dont know ky next word what did i just say what should i say i become mute during many discussion or work lunch with atleast  people sometimes you think it okay you will get better at this but no you watch others easily talk and converse there only le than few that can make me comfortable enough to talk without fearing and thinking too muchi really feel so out of place,anxiety911,doe anyone else always get surprised face whenever you tell people that you have social anxiety in my case it wa actually pretty severe at some point in my life i wa even too anxious to just go grocery shopping even though you could use selfcheckouts i didnt go out didnt meet friend and i wa extremely reliable on the few people i did know wellabout half a year ago i enrolled in college and that ha been my biggest exposure therapy so far it ha really helped me but what i found so odd is that i can apparently mask my social anxiety very well any time i land myself into a social interaction i can behave so casual and be so smooth in my conversing that the other person actually doesnt even perceive me a a shy person it even make me wonder if i am acting at all or genuinely le anxious than i wa before i still avoid social interaction a lot and awkward moment do haunt me to the point of not wanting to go through a similar awkward event but i guess i know now that i can trust myself in unexpected social interactionsthis doesnt apply to people i am crushing on btw i am a mindless awkward potato when someone i feel intimidated by talk to me sadly,anxiety912,im trying i go to work  day a week for  hour i drive my car i go shopping but everytime i feel like it wont get better sometimes worsepeople and my therapist say that after exposure the symptom lower well not for me i guess everytime i go drive my car go to work or go shopping i feel the same old panic inside that i need to get away from these people asap this might sound wierd but im affraid of facing this fear it soooo intense i could litterly pas out sometimes at least it feel like it my heart beat fast i cant think normally well work suck because i cant think straight my head is full of what other people think of me every calming technique make me more aware that im indeed freaking out it hard to explain but my head is like oh come on you cant calm down this intense of a feeling with just breahting are you dumbthe life im living currently isnt worth it everyone is better than me because i cant use my full brain power on anything i remember a a child being still socially anxious but not on this level and it wa a god sent,anxiety913,it something i think about everyday i love my freedom and doing what i want a a single guy but i also crave a loving relationship and possibly my own family one day im now  year old never even kissed a girl and i feel like the longer i leave it the le likely anything will ever happen but being painfully anxious doesnt help the situation anyone got any advice like maybe i should just suffer through and put myself out there until i find someone who like me im scared that ill shatter my confidence even more if i end up getting rejected i dont wanna die alone but i also suck at commitment,anxiety914,if youre reading this i know youre probably thinking it wa only in my head and im exaggerating but i promise you im noti know it because of how weird and awkward i am stuttering and stumbling over my wordsone wa even nonverbal it a big office and there people ive never seen before all the time i wa walking past them and awkwardly waved and said hello they literally just walked by me and laughed without saying hello back and this isnt the first time ive done this but usually im ignored rather than laughed at ive been ignored a few time and thats also humiliating every second im on this planet around people is pure torture i dont know how much longer i can go on like this,anxiety915,hi ive recently ive made a few new friend and im glad to have met them and i love texting them but im terrified of hanging out with them one on one i always end up canceling last minute or lying about being busy  how do i combat this i want to try and force myself to be more social slowly so i can make new friend but im so scared of that awkward stage of not knowing how to hang out with them alone i know that it can be fun and a lot of this is in my head but the panic still feel soooo real and i overthink it so much how can i prevent this doe anyone have any tip,anxiety916,hi so i record music and post it with some video on social medium i dont have a lot of follower but this is a semi public project some people who watch my creation know me irltoday a random internet person left me a nice and very enthusiastic comment it took me about an hour to reply and i wa anxious the whole time but i replied instead of staying quiet and didnt reply something too cringe either although im sure some cringe wa there too but that is fine baby step thats it thanks for reading,anxiety917,going outside feel wrong  i want to believe that it all in my head but i cant stop thinking that it more like my community is just complete shit and provides little opportunity for people with sa i live in a small city in the rust belt with a skyrocketing violent crime rate our public infrastructure is literally crumbling in most place and everything is so exclusively designed for car that many street dont even have sidewalk literally the majority of the population is overweight and ha probably never actually traveled more than a quarter of a mile outside of a vehicle unsurprisingly it seemingly ingrained in our local culture to hate cyclist and the road arent safe for them for the aformentioned reason i dont bikei used to walk across town a lot but the stroads are so desolate and pedestrianunfriendly that it feel illegal to walk in most place and crossing the street is a coin toss of life and death the last time i went for a walk through my neighborhood wa over a year ago and it wa a little disconcerting to me that the only other people i ever crossed path with were mother pushing stroller my fear of being out of my element a an individual adult male on the sidewalk wa only confirmed when multiple random people driving by stopped to ask me what i wa doing and if i wa okay im sure it seems unlikely but i know for a fact that there wa nothing conspicious about my appearance or demeanor that day other than me being the only guy on the sidewalk maybe they thought i shouldve been in school that day or something idk but really i think it just that unusual for them to see anyone who isnt a mother with a toddler out on a stroll nevertheless the thought of again being a public spectacle of concern simply for existing ha stopped me from going on anymore walk through town nowadays im actually probably significantly likely to get randomly shot god i love this countryi dont go shopping not at physical store anyways i hate useless junk and i already own everything i needwant so you will never see me at a pawn shop or flea market i dont usually have friend to hang out with so all activity of that nature might a well be off the table ive been to most of the museum multiple time a a child but imo they arent really that entertaining and therefore not worth the price of admission plus it not like ive ever actually learned anything from a museumwalking in nature is fun ocassionally but you are pretty much stuck with the public woodland trail here which are often closed and annoying to drive to and once youve walked any one trail more than a few time it really start to get boring not to mention most nature in general is kinda overrated the sound and isolation are really nice sure but the rest of the sens usually leave something to be desired i cant say i long for the constant smell of must and the inevitable surprise spider web in my face visually it a mixed bag some tree have cool shape and their leaf are always pretty but once youve seen one sprawling stretch of decidious eastern north american woodland youve basically seen it all the dirt and pile of dead leaf covering the ground are just ugly to me public park arent fun to go to because theyre mostly just oversized playground for kid and the trash can and bathroom facility seem strategically placed to cover every square inch of the ground with a lingering stench i grew up next to a lake and always thought it wa something better admired from a porch or window every body of water here is an unappealing shade of brown or green that stew in the sun all day and absolutely reek honorable mention to cave i actually really enjoy them but they are all monetized tourist attraction so people have brought this up before on other reddits but it seems like they just get shot down by everyone else for being perceived a cynical loser and get offered idea that obviously arent compatible for someone with sa even if i didnt have sa i seriously doubt id enjoy the atmosphere of anything like a club or party i always liked exploring especially at night but that feel illegal even when it isnt and im not comfortable with the thought of potentially having to deal with cop or vigilante in the current state of our society very often i get this cabin fever where i am so sick of staying indoors and using electronics but going outside i miss the day of my childhood in the mojave desert when my friend and i could just go out and mess around in the empty lot and no one would bat an eye,anxiety918,a goal of mine for  is to try dating im  f and have never dated although ive had crush and run at the first sign of reciprocation im not sure how much i really want to be in a relationship but i would like to experience dating and see how it go a id like to get married one day my thought is to get on  or  dating apps not sure which one and go on maybe  in person date every month or every other month but what im confused about is how exactly it work i make a profile and then what can someone give me a step by step of what to expect when online dating it seems so strange i cant really imagine it but i know i want to try im open to dating both men and woman if that make a difference,anxiety919,ive been feeling overwhelmed with work and my friend trying to set me up with this girl who im not even sure im all too interested in since i have no experience with relationship i keep making excuse to not follow through with this and im trying to make thing go well and get to know her better this upcoming weekend were all going to go hangout and im hoping i can get comfortable enough to where i can talk to her normally,anxiety920,i myself sometimes forget to answer message or have to re tape the thing so many time before sending so it a little hypocritical to me to say this but i would love if people could answer message faster especially after the message im overthinking about so it would avoid me insomniasanother night ruined by anxiety and this is not the first time because i dont know if the person didnt saw forgot to answer is busy or upset against mepeople are in their right being busy if it the case and dont own to answer quickly i m not upset on my part but tired to be super anxious every time not sleeping before am or sleeping and awaken in the middle of the night in half panic just because of this kind of situation,anxiety921,recently i started xanax  in june july i upped to mg havent upped it since july and i take three time a dayfast forward october i started taking mg of adderall i pretty

time in many year and i have to walk a distance to the park afterwards wish me luck ,anxiety923,i cant tell if im really good at eavesdropping not on purpose im just really paranoid so i subconsciously listen  or if my mind just make stuff up because im constantly looking out for people being mean or saying stuff about me ive heard some wild stuff tho compliment or just weird rude comment that are sometimes too wild to believe haha maybe im crazy but i wish i could turn it off either way,anxiety924,it like everything zone out and go blank you cant move or breathe or speak when people are having a conversation with someone next to you or to you it feel like there a heavy duty lamp pointed right at you you watch and focus and feel slight facial expression and try to fake them so they go along with the conversation at hand you dont know where to put your hand or how to move your body and leg and you question how they should be looking and where to put them so it not weird and nobody asks why you are moving so much you are forced to look them in the eye the worst part that i can only do for  second then i shift my eye around the room wondering where to look and where the appropriate location would be this is the worst part because they notice your not looking at them and you have to keep shifting from looking at there eye to everywhere else and then when they are quiet and they are looking for a response to the question you can focus again and then yah respond but the lamp is still beaming even hotter light on you now because now it your turn to talk so now im red faced and then i gotta think of a response and i get scared im not going to give a good awnser or not be able to say anything because i dont know what to say your mind is completely empty when you refocus and this is only from a  second conversation how can we possibly last  hour shift all day when our mind is completely exhausted way before our body is,anxiety925,or did they give you the silent treatment when you got a bad grade for example or were they really nitpicking the way you act in public just trying to see somethingview pollhttpswwwredditcompollzysv,anxiety926,she wa a very good friend to me and yet hasnt responded to my text or call in nearly a year i understand being busy but whats the point of keeping in contact in someone if youre not gonna reciprocate anyways i keep thinking about it and i just wanna move on from this friendship help,anxiety927,  i left for college in august after being homeschooled since th grade i never really had a problem being homeschool since i went to church youth group and played sport i also never felt like i needed to have friend since most people i knew didnt really have a lot in common with me or were quite frankly dumbass  however when i left for college i decided i did want to make friend with my peer i met a few people i kind of started to become friend with and it seemed great at first however weve since drifted apart im not in the same class a many of those people nor do i live in the same residence hall they will regularly stop by each others room and hang out and never bother to invite me i only know a few people in my hall and unfortunately i dont have the opportunity to hang out with them often my roommate also turned out to be a massive introvert and moved out first chance he got leaving me on my own this sucked because i wanted a roommate i know it not his job to deal with me or even be my friend however i did want one to have to push myself to talk once again i know it not my job but ive felt alone a i really dont have anyone now our hall also isnt very social ive made multiple attempt to get to know my neighbor but they dont seem interested in knowing me i also feel alone because other people in my class havent bothered to learn my name even though i actually happen to be an active participant in class discussion even my professor have acknowledged this i felt especially hurt since some people i did talk try to be friend with in that class held a study session i wasnt invited to and acted like they were sorry after i found out they invited me to a later one and acted like i wa wrong for not showing up because i dont want a pity invite i show up to party and talk to people which is a huge step for me because i never saw myself ever doing that but people forget im there i feel invisible no one make an effort to to talk to me when i muster up the courage to talk to someone i get stared at like my hair is on fire or i end up in an awkward conversation where the person act uninterested in knowing me the few conversation ive had have ended poorly because i run out of thing to say one ended with me leaving because i tried to talk about music and she couldnt even tell me which artist or generes she liked i thought she wa uninterested and left but she later said i didnt try in the conversation ive had an emotional breakdown and people tried calming me down and said they did care but i dont feel it ive tried explaining what it like to them but they tell me they dont understand i should just get over it

college how do i push my way into a friend group how do i beat these circumstance,anxiety928,i dont know how to interact aside from feeling anxious about everything im about to say or cant say there is an extreme discomfort in people taking interest in discoursing with me i dont know how to flirt and it seems like a normal interaction even a a joke everything i say come off to serious and too deep even when i think im joking i cant relate to a lot of the experience these people have again making me feel like a weirdo and i just cant help but think everyone in the room is better than me these are just because of social anxiety i think so many internal issue cause me to have social anxiety it like these issue are working together i just feel weird and odd ive always felt that way it is so easy for people around me to be around people talk on the phone without fear of running out of topic to discus having more than just one friend is so normal for others i really want  to be different but why doe it feel like somehow even i dont want to get better i know i have to put myself in uncomfortable situation i do thatmaybe not too often but i feel absolutely shit afterwards,anxiety929,it been  year since ive seen these  sister my parent were going over to their family house and one of these sister sent me a message and invited me to join my parent for dinner i came from the moment we saw each other thing went downhill i couldnt maintain eye contact i couldnt hold a conversation i couldnt get my point across the way i wanted to i said some stuff i shouldnt have said when you have someone with social anxiety in your own home id imagine they felt terribly uncomfortable then after some time  of them went upstairs then one came back and the other one left i felt like nobody wanted to talk to me because of how uncomfortable i wa and how i made them feel this ha been haunting me for day i started meal prepping and working out more aggressively but the friendship i have with them feel forever tarnished we were such good friend growing up  how do i cope i feel absolutely torn apart,anxiety930,title,anxiety931,tldr im normally a pretty socially capable person with my peer at school but all of this go out the window at work and im practically unable to socialize at allim currently a college student working a a parttime medical scribe for those who dont know we basically follow the doctor around a they see patient and take note for them ive worked with the same doctor and team for about  month now and in this time ive always kept to myself expecting at some point to be comfortable enough to come out of my shell but this never happenedi sit with the doctor in his office in silence a were both doing our work and occasionally he start some small talk he a very talkative person in general and i reciprocate but the conversation usually dy within a couple sentence sometimes his nurse and assistant come in the room and start to banter with him and i sort of just sit there giggling along without saying anything theyll usually turn to me and acknowledge me somehow and i usually just wave back or chuckle awkwardly unsure of what else to say dont get me wrong they are very kind and outgoing people and im sure they would be happy to include me in any conversation the problem is it like i just forget how to socialize while im at work it physically harder to speak and i often stumble over my wordsnormally id assume theyd just recognize that im an introvert but im worried it getting to a point where theyre starting to think im rude or arrogant like it not worth my time to talk to them which is super embarrassing because i never mean to come across that way what suck is that i dont even know if it all in my head im hoping to go to medical school so when i first got this scribing job i wa hopeful that id be able to establish good relationship with everyone in the healthcare team and maybe even earn a solid letter of recommendation from the doctor now im questioning if he even know me well enough after seven month or think im socially competent enough to even pursue medicine and if im being honest im even questioning myselfits not like im completely socially inept i worked a an orientation leader and even got hired a a student coordinator at my university if it my job i can talk to stranger hold conversation and be witty i have no problem with public speaking and i even sing and perform in group regularly clearly i am capable i know im an interesting person with hobby and passion but at work it like it all go out the window and i just become this robot hunched over a laptop incapable of anything more than timidly stammering out a good morning to whoever greets him im going to be working in this team for another  month or so  hour a week but it just feel like ive already cemented my place a that quiet asian kid who doesnt want to talk to yousometimes i wonder why im like this maybe it because i feel like im at the bottom of the totem pole so it not my place to speak i wa expected to be quietly obedient to authority figure growing up maybe it because i grew up in a foreign country and moved to the u for college but i speak with an american accent so they would never know that i dont actually know much about what they talk about maybe it because im at least  year younger than everyone else in the office so it hard to relate to a lot of what they rant or celebrate about i know thinking about these thing is probably doing more harm than anythingdoes anyone else have experience with this any tip for how to overcome this anxiety and thank you for reading this loooong post i needed to vent since this ha been bothering me for month now i really appreciate it  ,anxiety932,im an introvert with social anxiety and depression so for year i had no friend and felt like everyone made fun of me i started treatment and talking to people in college but i noticed that i really procrastinate when it come to replying message or hanging out i really want friend that i can talk and hangout with but rather i dont feel like talking to anyone and cant push myself to reply message if i dont absolutely have to when people want to hangout with me id be really happy but id say i dont have time even the girl who im crushing on i dont feel like chatting with her at all and would spend day to respond to her messagesi dont want to be someone who life is  in my bedroom but thats the only thing i can do why is it is there a psychology behind it am i just too irresponsible to have friend am i trying to run away from life,anxiety933,she got hired for stockingcashiering but today she skipped her first day she got dressed and ready to go but she stopped at the door and said she just couldnt do it and broke down cry she ha worked at job before but her gender transition ha made her social anxiety much worse besides some uber eats which she ha stopped doing she ha not been employed for nearly  year shes still scrolling the job forum constantly but im starting to feel very down and my optimism is dwindling,anxiety934,okay kind of a specific question mainly because i can never find the right advice for doing customer service with adult a an adult specifically i will run into advice about how to help childrenteens talk to adult or how to initiate and keep a casual conversation going with an adult but never something like talking to adult on a job i think it a completely different relationship since any complaint they have will reflect badly on you and your entire future whereas messing up a casual conversation will just mean you guy dont click anymore for context im a  year old medical receptionist ive been told how much i need to get this correct and how  because were dealing with someone wellbeing here  i cant afford mistake the way other receptionist job can not just that but ive been doing online school meaning ive been cooped up with my parent for  year now and ever since they started policing how i sleep i have trouble figuring out how to deal with anxiety and how to deal with adult especially the one that are around my parent age so all that expectation with my preconceived subconscious expectation that theyre going to tell me how im doing everything wrong any minute now is obviously getting to me im getting better at putting on a customer service voice and blocking out the thought but somehow my anxiety still affect me physically i start to talk quietly and stutter when something happens that i have no clue how to deal with and when i do know exactly how to help im apparently shaking according to my coworkers i have no clue how to control this i sometimes dont even notice im doing this until someone point it out for example the shaking i never felt myself shaking but it apparently happened or if i do i dont know how to control it my jaw and leg hurt too after a stressful call im probably tensing them without even knowing huhfor some reason i can think straight when i get an angry client but not a calm one we usually get people who are my parent age or higher so most dont have the energy to be angry  picky but not angry  and my anxiety go haywire because of it it like those fear people have where the anticipation is more terrifying than the actual thing itself there also the fact that most are my parent age or have a caretaker my parent age and im just expecting them to act exactly like my parent do when i probably shouldnt today a kid came in and suddenly i wa fine for a bit it just the adult that really get to me because i know they come in with their preconceived bias and expectation that i dont exactly meet also if youre wondering my parent dont allow me to see a therapist like straight up they will fight tooth and nail to make sure i never see one and id rather use the money i make for saving up for an apartment or somewhere to move out hopefully this is enough context to help a hyperspecific situation i honestly dont know what to do back then i use to be great at addressing my anxiety but with the lack of sleep i get i dont have the energy to do any of my coping mechanism without a risk of a headache so im asking for new one here how do i address this,anxiety935,i work in fast food and i dont normally talk much to the customer but today there wa a  guy and he seemed to be in a good mood he asked some generic question trying to have a conversation but i couldnt think of anything to say so i kept replying with the shortest possible answer i feel bad because he probably think i didnt want to talk to him but i literally couldnt i guess thats what social anxiety doe to you youre so focused on trying not to mess up the order while trying not saying the wrong thing while trying not to look stupid all at the same time it also make me realize how much fun it going to be for me to get into any kind of university or find a decent job when i have  friend  connection and cant even have a simple conversation i guess this world just isnt for people like me,anxiety936,hi guysi dont really know how to start this post so im just going to get right into it im f unemployed college student i have what id consider severe social anxiety just a few example of this would be being so shy to the point of not knowing how to have a conversation with someone not being able to go to a party or a football game without having a panic attack and leaving after  minute even when i have my bf by my side and even just going to the store or to class scare the hell out of me ive had  job in my life a janitor and a walmart pickup associate i loved my custodian job but unfortunately had to move to go to college and when i got the walmart job after i moved

where i literally am so angry at myself for not being able to just be normal and not fear social interaction and crowded place im so broke and have been looking for a job for month but the only thing holding me back is that social anxiety it not because im lazy which is what everyone around me think im just too embarrassed to tell anyone how bad my anxiety is out of fear of being called a puy but when you have this eating away at you it not something you can just turn off or get yourself to not think about i am lost i have no idea how to even get a job because i just know i cant work with the public without having a panic attack andor going home to cry everyday i fear angry people annoyed people messing something up and everything else under the sun i need help or someone that is in the same boat a me because i cant keep living like this i want so badly to make friend i literally have none and to not fear doing daily thing like going to school the store work etc i want a job where i can work behind the scene and not have to talk to people every day but ive had unfortunate luck in finding something like that with the qualification i have not to mention i also fear drivingmaybe even more so than interacting with stranger im just a hot mess and dont know how to get over all of this if anyone ha suggestion for good job for me or way to get over my fear theyd be so appreciated short i have extreme social anxiety and fear of driving and cant find a job that would allow me to work privately and individually with the qualification i have i havent told anyone the real reason

and repeat but i still cant compete with the natural look and confidence some of my old peer have but i can handle all of that for the most part and wa down to go and socialize until i heard about the hot tubwe were asked to dress like a party and to bring pajama for when the ball drop plus a swimsuit for the hot tub im  and lb on a good day i am skinny idk if it help to put that im gay in here not like super noticeable at all but thats just what ive been told there will be  dude at the party a of now and i just cant take my shirt off and put short on around all these dude who i know are attractive all the way around and they know it toothat wa honestly my breaking point like i dont know if i can even do it drunk im honestly looking for what others might do or have done to help their nerve in the situation i already know that nobody care and everyone is focused on themselves but thats not reassuring at all i dont want to be one of those guy who sits out or wear a shirt bc he obviously insecure so thats not even in my option either thanks for reading i hope someone could relate ,anxiety942,so i posted a few time about interviewing for job  all ultimately resulted in rejection but i got a no interview job offer a an additional assistant for an elementary school it  an hour i applied to a bunch of job to the county school system  some i got reply back i through my hat im the ring for being a substitute or art teacher but i wa too nervous to go for that  i interviewed for one i wa hoop for  a front desk assistant at an art vocational high school got rejected but this one is totally doable especially since i didnt have to interview im so bad at describing myself and my experience in interview and blank that i think thats what kept me back i believe they probably are desperate for employee the process wa a bit lengthy i started the onboarding process last month and only just got fingerprinted which i had to pay for myself but hopefully this will be a success,anxiety943,like the title say despite me suffering from social anxiety im leaving my state of new york and heading down to tampa bay florida to see my best friend it gonna be nerve wracking since i have to go on flight by myself and catch an uber alone but i really want to go not only to have something to tell my therapist but also for my own accomplishment it the only place other than

id go into the city to a bar to catch some live music i wa standing at the bar and some guy approached me to speak and spoke for a short while i then approached some other guy who wa standing by himself and started speaking to him wa a nice guy  spoke to him for a few minute i then went one step further and initiated conversation with a girl standing at the bar harder to speak to girl a a guy i find and spoke to her briefly while wa queuing up at bar considering how miserable i wa feeling earlier  i went home feeling good that i did something to make a bit of progress i found it wa helpful that there wa live music on and sport on the television and it wa a busy enough bar so i wa able to kind of float around to other side of bar so wasnt just standing in same spot all the time,anxiety945,what job would fit a socially anxious person ,anxiety946,m ive always had extreme anxiety around people it used to be the case that i hated it because it would get in the way of trying to make friend but over time i genuinely have no interest in getting a friend one day i just stopped looking i have never once felt lonely when i am alone but whenever i am around people i feel so extremely anxious about everything my breathing pattern my breathing volume trembling oversalivating necessary eye contact hardest one plus a bunch more stuff i pay attention to whenever im talking to someone i genuinely feel that if i dont keep my body habit in perfect sync then everyone will see how nervous i am and ask me whats wrong then all the attention would suddenly shift to me which i can not handle when i am alone in my room nowadays i feel absolute relief and gratefulness that i am not outside with people i feel real happiness and thats what scare me over the past year ive been morphing into this thing that can honestly function psychologically without people when i wake up and see no message it mean there are no problem for the day this ha destroyed multiple friendship since i never answer call or message because i convince myself that the world doesnt know i exist then i can never be a target ive found liberty in invisibility but on the inside i know it wrong especially a a human being who want to be self sufficient and get a job to live on his own i need to learn how to exist with people but here i am in my room never had a job college drop out you can guess whyi am not posting this for advice i have been given every piece of advice you can think of in the end i am the one required to make change to my life   this post is for those who think that social anxiety cant get any worse it truly is an endless spiral one that go a deep a you let it if your at the stage where you can talk to people but want to try staying inside all the time which is pretty tempting after you finish school  then you can at least see what it might be to come be it can get so ugly and toxicthe mind can be so deceptive,anxiety947,ever since i finished high school and started working abroad ive missed having a group of friend of my own and have always been an extra in other people group not that it necessarily matter but i dont have a lot in common with people

absolutely cannot do that i hate seeing my own face it so bad i have gotten to the point with at least  of my best friend that i can call them and im perfectly fine but if we sit there in silence for awhile id want to hang up even with my best friend i talk to every day i would never facetime them which doesnt make sense because ive hung out with them and occasionally do still,anxiety949,so i m

and have a really hard time getting to know new people and getting new friendsi dont have a lot of friend and i only really have one friend who i spend time with we decided to spend new year eve

night just ha to be oversorry just needed to rant somewhere,anxiety952,hi everyone i hope you can help me with this predicament or just hear me out im  year old and rarely am able to sit through a conversation with someone a little bit about me is i just recently graduated from college and during that time had intense depression during that time period i completely withdrew from friend and loved one and graduated with little to no friend at nobody fault but my own something i find really difficult to cope with is my fear of just getting food with people or having a converstaion with someone something like superficial talk or introduction are easy and fluid for me but having more indepth conversation feel impossible i realize that even with my close friend i find it difficult to even say yes to going to an event or getting food with them during conversation when ill be explaining a story or concept or just talking to someone my mind go completely blank im telling you ill be super into something im talking about and then my train of thought completely disappears i find it difficult to hold onto conversationsnow im trying to work on this but im not sure if im going about it the right way my spotify  wrapped said i listened to over  minute of music i know that sound random but that go to show how much i kind of tuneout of life and whatever is going on around me i choose to listen to music a a safe place i dont listen to podcasts or anything just thing that are comfortable and allow me to do thing passively it like actively thinking is hard for me i cant concentrate and hold a conversation for shit im scared that ill be stuck in this loop where i am just passively moving through life and not cherishing conversation with friend etc the wild part is that im a seemingly extroverted person im very welcoming to people and i feel that i put on this persona once people will start talking to me and trying to befriend me i have this feeling that theyll realize how stupid i sound or how boring i am in a conversation im tired of this i want to make connection with people and i feel myself wanting that so bad but it like there tv static going on in my head once i have to actually talk to people the only thought in my head is when will this be over and it make me feel like shit because i do want to get to know the other person but my mind just go elsewhere and i feel panicked about what the next thing ill say is the interesting part is that when it more of a group conversation i have no problem being hyper and fun but oneonone conversation scare the shit out of me when people say they actually want to get lunch with me or a chill hangout i am genuinely bewildered because i consider it torture i dont want it to be but it my gut instinct i feel crazyim trying to listen to podcasts more and read more so that i can be more interesting but i dont know something feel wrong about the way im going about this,anxiety953,i tried to meet new people this year but it didnt work out because of my severe anxiety and i feel incredibly lonely and spiral down in depressing thought every time i think about new yearswhat do you do to distract yourself and feel better that day,anxiety954,are some people offended by this  i just ran into a coworker at a store had the requisite minute chat at the end of which i wished them a happy new year and they seemed put off by it  wondering if it just me or if there a chance i legit offended them and i cant stop thinking about itnew year is a completely secular holiday a far a i can tell so i never would expect this to offend someone unless they had explicitly told me so beforehand  i have no idea of the coworkers religious belief or what other holiday they celebrate  but if new year ha some religious connotation im not aware of or is otherwise offensive to some people obviously id prefer to know  or maybe youll all just confirm im overthinking this ,anxiety955,usually i stick by my dad side but today me and my dad split up so i could have a chance to spend my christmas money and try to be independent i never thought i would achieve this because im always trying to avoid people and try to feel protected by my dad side but i did and it felt typical i did alonewell not paying but everything else for myself when i went to get pokemon violet i stammered to get help from the guy working there to get the game for selfcheckout socializing isnt my strong suit but i somehow did it i did kinda had a internal panic attack wondering where my dad wa when i tried yo reunite

is organising a new year eve party at the house of one of u  initially i thought it wa going to be fine it wa just u  so i thought i could kick it up a notch and try to be more expansive  basically i could have felt more confident because i wa going to be with my closest friendsbut today like five or six new people i dont know them at all got invited at the party and now i dont really want to even go there anymorei feel like i could either close myself completely and be almost completely silent in their presence or like i could embarrass myself in front of them if like i get tipsy and then i say too much about myself or if i tell a joke that only my closest friend could understand and it not that i can simply avoid them because the house is pretty smallwhat should i do on one hand i dont want to miss the party and be alone on new year eve on the other i dont want to feel uncomfortable with stranger,anxiety967,so here is how our text conversation wentme after talking about snapchat

someone would come to my desk would never talk in meeting and would never really go for promotion due to fear of public speaking i have been working  remote in a role that requires a lot of meeting and although it still a struggle i feel like it sooo much easier for me to handle v being in person remote work ha been a life saver for me and now i finally have hope i can continue to move up in my career   curious if anyone else feel the same way,anxiety973,so slowly im starting to think i might be stuck in a nearconstant dissociative state especially when im so in my head fearful and overcome with feeling that people will attack me judge me or humiliate me it like the world is not really therei can see it there but sound are muffled my vision is like im stuck in sort of a soap bubble i can touch a wall feel it but it just doesnt feel like it really there is this dissociation and what cause it doe anyone experience this,anxiety974,i know that this is mainly advice for child to not talk to just random adult stranger but i still think this is a bad advicei think this can cause that the child might take it more literally and they might stay away even from stranger that are same age or when they grow older they might still be scared to talk to adult stranger because this is what their parent learned them,anxiety975,removed,anxiety976,for over a decade my parent would ask whats wrong with me why am a loner jobless quiet etc my response were either nothing wrong am ok or i just kept quiet since my sa ha it good and bad moment the old folk asked me again during one of the good moment and i just let loosethey were surprisingly and to my relief very supportive they will now be participating in some of my exposure therapy attempt i just hope this time ill stick to the battle unlike most of my previous attempt until it is won ,anxiety977,for example i remember in high school we had relatively young new teacher come in one year for english and in the first week he said dont worry im not gonna randomly pick on anyone and ask them a question i encourage you to answer but no sweat if you dont want to i hated when my teacher did thatthis wa such a relief to me a i would always be anxious about being put on the spot like in previous year i couldnt sleep properly knowing i could get randomly asked to answer a question in class the next dayhe wa a good dude i liked his class and i think i performed by best that year anyone else have any people that made your life with sa so much simpler,anxiety978,i volunteered at a psychiatry clinic today it wa my first time doing something like that and i wa excited i wa little bit afraid of losing my self but i did a good job actually i losed myself but in good way i think i just adapted to the room and find myself just talking to people i dont even remember all of it  i dont what happened but i just started talking people and meet some peopleafter the event i started to overthink about if i did everything normal or if people thought i wa little awkward beacuse i really talked and expressed myself and social anxiety is a fear of other people judgment of you but i think i can handle itanyway i just wanted to share my expreince to anyone who feel insecure about volunteering in thing it is going to be ok just try,anxiety979,it in two hour ,anxiety980,this is no recommendation daily use of any substance especially psychoactive is connected to big health risk and dangerous withdrawal this is just a thread to summarize your experience and opinion on using dxm for depression social anxiety and other mental health issuesi dont want to use it daily max x a week to introduce it into my cycling plan so i dont have to use lyrica or kratom daily anymore and can switch them rn im only using lyrica a prescribed for  week doing some day off here and there but i dont want to prolong this use due to tolerance amp withdrawal risk of regular lyrica use  even if prescribed like this id love to be able to use lyrica x a week kratom x a week dxm x a week and thats the cycle day off between everytime just some insight into why im creating this post  the fact to have a reddit post to collect all the information science experience story and opinion regarding dxm for mental health issuesdxm work similar to ketamine and is now even used in a new  antidepressant medication called auvelity containing mg dxm  mg bupropionwellbutrin compound this new antidepressant which should act rapidly in comparison to other ad is meant to use daily for week to month a most antidepressant so it seems that science see the danger of daily dxm lower than usually thoughtthere are a bunch of people having success with dxm treating their depression amp social anxiety with it only a few

comment likedex also helped me with my social awkwardness and helped my confidence a lotthis is analogous to a dxm trip i took yesterday i took a much smaller dose but noticed a huge relief in social anxiety i much better at just thinking of what to say in any particular situation i imagined this is probably related to why ketamine and ibogaine are so effective for depression and anxiety both if them being huge dissociativesit dxm work great for me at low level i usually take mg a few day a week and it yas been incredibly helpful for my depression and anxiety it seems to be helping my adhd a well at that low of a dose i dont really feel fucked up and i find that i actually function even betterive been on a variety of different med  treatment combination for debilitating anxiety and depression ocd and bipolar ii since i wa a teenager with a couple stint of being off them completely many of them helped to an extent they allowed me to function and reduce the frequency of severe depressive episode but they also came with a lot of negative side effect and more so numbed my emotion so the depression felt more mild but so did my joyi did ketamine infusion last summer followed by at home nasal spray for maintenance after my rd infusion it wa like the cloud that ha hung over me my entire life wa completely lifted it didnt just blunt the pain it actually healed it and allowed me to face my pain and try to work through it unfortunatelyofficialmedical ketamine is very expensive and not covered by insurance i wa doing a ton of in depth research about the science  mechanism behind it and thats when i discovered that dxm work in an extremely similar way a ketamine and there is actually an antidepressant thats close to fda approval that combine dxm and wellbutrinthe cost is way more affordable on a long term basis it all come down to knowing the window of effectiveness and taking the correct dosetldr smaller dos of dxm taken a few day a week can help depressionanxiety tremendously seems to also help adhd it underlying mechanism of action are very similar to ketamine but dxm is way more affordablea bit about the psychopharmacology via wikipediait is in the morphinan class of medication with sedative dissociative and stimulant property at lower dos dextromethorphan doe not have a significant affinity for the muopioid receptor activity typical of morphinan compound and exerts it therapeutic effect through several other receptor in it pure form dextromethorphan occurs a a white powderdextromethorphan is also used recreationally when exceeding approved dosage dextromethorphan act a a dissociative hallucinogen it ha multiple mechanism of action including action a a nonselective serotonin reuptake inhibitor and a sigma receptor agonist dextromethorphan and it major metabolite dextrorphan also block the nmda receptor at high dos which produce effect similar to other dissociative anesthetic such a ketamine nitrous oxide and phencyclidinedextromethorphan ha been found to posse the following action ltm using rat tissue uncompetitive antagonist of the nmda receptor via the mkpcp site sert and net blocker cf serotoninnorepinephrine reuptake inhibitor sigma  receptor agonist negative allosteric modulator of nicotinic acetylcholine receptor ligand of the serotonin htbd histamine h adrenergic and muscarinic acetylcholine receptorsdextromethorphan is a prodrug of dextrorphan which is the actual mediator of most of it dissociative effect through acting a a more potent nmda receptor antagonist than dextromethorphan itself what role if any methoxymorphinan dextromethorphans other major metabolite play in it effect is not entirely clear,anxiety981,idk why but he just look charmingdoes the lad have a name,anxiety982,ive suffered with social anxiety pretty much my entire life it been so unbearable made me feel useless and like there no point in carrying on bout of cry and panic attack were happening on a daily basis back in march i started on sertraline ive been journaling a lot and have been trying to work through the effect of childhood trauma i applied for a voluntary role in a charity shop in june a i wa so desperate to feel normal the anxiety wa sickening i wa struggling to sleep i felt so drained and panicky after a few week of this volunteering i started to get used to it and although i wa still very anxious i wa somewhat coping fast forward  month i applied for a paid job elsewhere went for a trial and got offered the job im so nervous to start and still am struggling badly with anxiety but i never thought id ever get this far ive gone from not being able to leave the house to getting a job it wa a slow process but so worth it the aim of this post is to give people some hope over  year of shame isolating myself panic attack not showing up for schoolcollegeuni and im now actually enjoying my volunteering instead of waking up with the intense dread knowing i have to see people the term fake it til you make it ha really worked for me i know sometimes it impossible to hide your anxiety when it severe which is why small step are important my starting point wa going to a supermarket and interacting with the person serving me at the till  this at one point caused me to panic my journey with social anxiety definitely isnt over but im so proud of how far ive come it unreal most people wouldnt really understand how much of a huge thing this is but everyone in this group know how horrific living with social anxiety is,anxiety983,this is mainly just a vent for myself but i am interested if anyone ha any similar story or any advice for meover the past year or so my blushing ha become way worse i remember specifically realising what wa starting to happen at my graduation i felt quite hot the entire time but didnt think much of it at first i got an award at my graduation and i wa constantly thinking that everyone in the crowd wa judging me and thinking why did they get the award and not  this made my blushing really bad after it wa over my friend asked me why i wa wearing makeup because i hate makeup and i said i wasnt wearing any my face had been red for nearly  hour i started feeling really sht and once i wa able to leave i walked away from the venue a quick a possiblei also sometimes catch the bus home with one of my friend he ha a lot of friend and whenever we are at the bus stop he is constantly talking to them i always stand a little bit away from them because just being near his friend make my anxiety really bad but whenever our bus get there i think that he would rather anyone other than me would catch the bus with him because of how much fun he seems to have with his friend this cause me to go really red and since he sometimes point it out and asks why i go red it kind of make it worse i also hate bus because i feel like everyone is constantly staring at me and judging mea couple week ago my school got  of the year level together there were  people in the gym and i already knew what wa going to happen at the assembly this caused me to start blushing before i even got there what happened wa they wanted everyone to get into group of up to  for our activity week when they told everyone to get into group i started shaking and blushing severely i immediately found one of my friend but when people i had never seen before joined u i started having a panic attack i wanted to run away from the gym and never come back luckily someone in my class realised and came to help me my friend wa also very understanding a to why i wanted to leave the group i still got quite a bit of anxiety in the new group but not a much it wa quite hard to work out what to do in the first place because my  friend all went to different group so there wa always going to be people in the group i got lot of anxiety around,anxiety984,im a commuter at a university in england and ive made no friend whatsoever in my first and second year i wa inside due to the pandemic though for second year we did have a hybrid option i still wa reluctant to go outside i have agoraphobia on top of my social anxiety and so im too scared to go out to social event and gathering so it been impossible to meet anyone all i do is go to class for a couple hour once to thrice a week then go back home it been difficult adjusting to going back in person over the last semester i also find that i dont ever get approached before class in the hallway or afterwards i dont even look intimidating im just a regular looking petite girl the only time i talk to people is when we are doing group work but thats it then i bolt back home to be in solitude i never hang out in the department space it just make me feel horrible that i completely wasted my time at uni and that my mental health ha contributed massively to this the last semester of my degree start in january and it too late to meet anyone at this point i hate myself for being in this position it just so lonely,anxiety985,ive always been depressed an socially anxiojs but in my early s i developed a horrible blushing condition that ruined my life i blush at inappropriate moment that make me look bad and damage my reputation in fact i rarely blush unless i think reputation damage is on the line because of it coworkers have complained about me and asked to get reassigned people have gotten really creeped out and upset with me for it i do it around everyone too even my parentsi tried to live with it for a couple year but it only got worse and im done now it just hurt way too much and i cant take the pain anymore i stay in my apartment cant even get out to the dentist and my parent are supporting me i feel completely numb inside and barely enjoy anything anymoreim on like  med ive tried just about everything out there ive been doing therapy for a long time but so far nothing ha really showed promise for me there a surgery that supposedly make you unable to blush but i cant afford itso im at a loss ive kind of just accepted the way thing are and given up it very hard to see thing getting any better,anxiety986,sometimes i make post on reddit and recieve a few comment on them a lot of the comment are nice but a good handful of them are kind of mean and judgemental and it trigger my social aniexty ha anyone else here experienced this,anxiety987,ive always been afraid to try new thing with people around because im afraid id fail at it get embarrassed get judged be laughed at etc in elementary and middle school jump rope wa a common activity ive never learned to jump rope and a a child i wa so anxious and scared of trying something new with people around that i would never do it id refuse i felt shame at how i could not go outside my comfort zone i felt like an alien a i just stood there while every other kid wa doing it successfully i always had a thought like everybody always succeeds theyre normal but i will probably be the only one to fail and embarrass myself i had music class and i wouldnt play any instrument because i didnt want to try it around people it a common trope in my life i wish there wa somebody who helped mei dont think ive changed much,anxiety988,ive been friend with this girl for  year she is my only regular friend ive ever really made due to my social anxiety and ever since we were kid shes always been the sweetest person i know she is a very devout christian me i wa raised christian and buddhist but became atheist at an early age growing up i never let this religious difference deter our friendship i know that people can be friend even if they dont follow the same faith half my family still go to church and i get along well with most of them besides the one that are highly conservative to the point that they force their belief on othersmy friend ha often invited me to her church activity and i even attended a few of them that werent too preach heavy there were time i felt that she wished i would convert but she never forced it on me and ive always been appreciative of that even if i felt anxious about not having that in common with her and worrying how she thought about me for itanyhow she recently shared with me that one of her life goal is to spread the message of jesus through global mission trip she is currently preparing to go to costa ricai have personally learned a lot about how mission trip can cause more harm than good that they carry tone of white saviorship and that it is better to donate to certain cause than to participate in what many have called modern day colonizationi dont know how to have a conversation with my friend about this i dont want to trash on her passion and i know she is a good person i just feel like this life goal is misguided i know it not my place to lecture her but im very conflicted,anxiety989,pretty much what the title say i dunno guess i just wanna see if this is common or not,anxiety990,so i suppose ill start with an autobiographical section before getting to where i am today hopefully this wont be too long ive been in a pretty bad depressive state for the past few month and it stem from my loneliness a well a a fear that i will be unable to change it i havent had any irl friend i have online friend since th grade late  and thats obviously extremely abnormal and the length of time is one of the thing that make it feel impossible for me i used to be of the belief that it wa just social anxiety that caused this but upon closer examination i think that thats only one aspect of itthe main thing thats been on my mind lately is that i dont share anything in common with anybody anymore back when i did have friend we would take about typical  year old boy thing like video game youtubers just whatever right well since th grade ive only had  real interest that ive spent almost all of my free time on music and later on politics i know that these arent exactly obscure thing but nobody want to talk about politics all day and when i say music i mean listening to multiple album a day every day im completely out of the loop on thing like sport movie tv book video game etc i feel a if ive been living in a different world to normal people and dont know how to converse with them because we just operate completely differentlythese year of isolation have impacted my social skill pretty badly too i go silent in group because i never have anything to add i never start conversation only ever responding i just cant think of something to say i feel like im too short and blunt in conversation and obviously my anxiety is quite bad i cant keep a conversation going without losing steam after  minute or le i think my problem is that ive become a onedimensional person i also suspect i may have undiagnosed autism and i dont know how much that will complicate thingsso i dont know what to do now im willing to expand my horizon and interest and not just out of a perceived necessity but out of genuine interest a well in a way that will help me relate to people but i still have question and concern with that for instance where would i go to find people i clicked with ive been dabbling in some thing like video game anime film etc and that lead me to question like which gamesanimefilm should i consume to relate to people how long will it take to get to a point where im conversational how much do i need to have in common with someone to forge a friendship etc there just a lot that i dont know and i feel that im ready to change but dont know what to do or where to go  i dont know what kind of person i want to bei also worry that this is all in vain and it may be futile to even try to change thing i feel a if ive ruined my life how do i deal with those feelingsin any case im slightly hesitant about posting this because im sure there will have been some thought or detail that i forgot to mention but this is the bulk of it so whatever,anxiety991,im not talking about unwarranted selftalk but just like hey i relate to what you said because type of stuff i never talk about myself until im asked about something and it suck i had friendship that sucked because whenever i talked about what wa happening in my life they would act like i wa bragging or like they were annoyed so i stopped talking about myself i dont talk to any of those friend anymore sometimes i catch myself talking about myself and then feel bad because it feel like i wa bragging most of the time people dont ask and i can only assume thats normal it make conversation so hard all i can do to start a conversation is ask about them and most of the time i can barely think of thing to ask i feel like it make talking to me so boring,anxiety992,today me and my parent went to go eat at a restaurant i used to work at but it wa a different location and they make all their restaurant the exact same when we got there i immediately recognized that wood smell and the atmosphere of the place and it started bringing back all the bad memory i worked at that place for a little over a year and the last time i had been in one of those restaurant wa like  month ago and when i wa working there some pretty bad stuff happened to me i cant stop thinking about how i used to be and how different i wa treated back then im trying to go to bed but i started remembering and my heart started racing and all these memory flooded my mind i didnt even go to the exact restaurant i used to work at and i ended up feeling this anxious but one good thing did come out of today at least this upcoming weekend i wa invited to go play mini golf with some friend and the girl ive been talking to is also going to be there my friend ha been telling me that she ha been mentioning me a lot and this is going to be a great way to do something out my comfort zone,anxiety993,im asking did any oh you get verbally abused by a family member growing up my mom and sister always called me bad name to the point of believing them still to this day they will say those hurtful world and every time i call them out act like it didnt happen when i call my mom a mean name she say not to talk to her like that im your mother but im supposed to take extreme insult a a child i just dont understand,anxiety994,i finally got the courage to join a dating app and i met this awesome guy we have so much in common and he hella sweet last night he asked me if i wanted to meet and i said yes i sounded really eager too but when i woke up i felt so sick and anxious i had a migraine and heart burn i really like him but i just could not do it i told him i couldnt go today and i wa honestly about my anxiety he wa soo nice about it i felt really horrible and i still do and now im kind of nervous to message him now i feel like i messed up and that i shouldnt have joined a dating app but god i really do like him i dont know what to even say at this point eitherif anyones got advice or something pleaseee let me know ,anxiety995,last year i met someone at my previous job she wa a nice girl with social skill we became friend unfortunately i pushed her out because of social anxiety  how well i found a better job and told her she should apply for it so we can work together hoping that she could be my only friend that could give me strength to attend gathering dinner party and thing like that however she became friend with everyone everyone like her they know her name more than they know mine actually i think nobody know my name even though ive been working there for two year and i belong to the fucking staff a a recruiter well thats a  my fault i guess she ha social skill and i dont thats the difference now we barely talk and i would venture to say ive lost another friend because it so overwhelming to see her laughing around and going to every party with our other coworkers while i prefer to stay at home watching netflix and playing the sims ,anxiety996,it wa when i wa  year old and my social anxiety wa at it peak at that time our relative called for dinner and we went there  and after a while i wa afraid that others would notice me when i invited them for dinner my face started getting very red everyone started eating but i could not eat and ran away from there and everyone wa surprised and  get angry with me  i stay hungry that day,anxiety997,im afraid that mine make me boring especially if i want to date in the future,anxiety998,yesterday i wa in the car with my parent and they were talking about how im improving because i wa able to talk to a store cashier they told me that i used to be so weird and depressed i kept quiet the whole ride because no my anxiety is still there they didnt know that i almost had a panic attack when talking to the cashier and my face wa so red but i had a mask on now i cant tell them about therapy because theyll continue to shame me and make me feel like somethings wrong with me when i just want help,anxiety999,i am a sm with adhdautism i am a lowlevel retail manager of a small teami hate speaking my speech come out stuttery or slurred a lot due to nervousness when i talk phone give me a lot of anxiety i feel a panic attack coming on when my phone ring and people calling me over and overphone text verbally etc skyrocket my anxiety level towards having a meltdown i need timeoff to not talk or socialize during the day or i lose my mindwhat led me to silencing my phone wa the fact my most of my boss have little respect for personal time and spaceno advice needed quitting soon and im taking care of the situation despite me being hourly not salary and spam me with phone call phone call over and over while im working harassment when im clocked out calling me on my break demanding thing from me and calling waking me up in the middle of the night never for good reason either always just useless harassment thats entirely unnecessary it would make me so anxiousangry i would feel like having i wa going to have a stroke i get overwhelmed very easily it been a week and it amazing i am so sick of the idea that now people are expected to be available  and live their life around a piece of beeping glass i hardly touch my phone anymore and i feel so much le stressed no more annoying ringing all the time that stress me out call and message now sit there until i feel like answering it never anything important and the world keep spinning regardless of my engagement with it people who call me and get mad that i dont pick up instantly can get mad all they want not my problem sound like a you problemalso my screentime ha decreased due to now not getting suckered into going on social medium due to notification social medium make me feel anxious and depressed limiting it help a lot and this just helped even morewould recommend if you get anxiety from phone silence it set it down away from you and dont touch it let yourself breathe cant tell you how much better my headspace just instantly healed from that small thing,anxiety1000,my sa is so bad that it basically selective mutism or avpd in my mind if you have those people in your life then you must be lying or you dont have a sa disorder i feel like that would be shyness instead obviously thats not for me to decide im not a professional who can diagnose others if youre professionally diagnosed with sa and you have friend andor a so cherish those people cherish them because others have it bad enough to the point where they cant even build relationship or even seek help from a therapist im sure my opinion are all based on experience and jealousy constantly being alone having no friend seeing classmate enjoying their time together standing by myself against the wall at homecoming just to leave an hour in then cry at home for being pathetic etc i know i dont have the worst struggle in the world there are many people who have it a lot worse than me im just sick and tired of those on this sub who have it a whole lot easier and claim to have sa thats a me problem and it something i need to work on i shouldnt be feeling this way i feel like i should be ashamed of myself this is a vent post and it not meant to offend or hurt anyone if it did then im sorry,anxiety1001, i wa bullied all throughout elementary school but had some friend with me still i believe the bullying wa one of the major reason i have social anxiety today i want to see if anyone else with social anxiety went through the same thing and how they overcame it some tipstricks to make my or anyone el social anxiety better will be greatly appreciatedview pollhttpswwwredditcompollzxtyj,anxiety1002,a huge reason why i have social anxiety is because of how i look i am a  year old blond hair blue eyed man with odd feature i will never look even remotely normal no matter what i do if i could wake up one day looking handsome or just normal i would be able to develop social skill and slowly lose my social anxiety,anxiety1003,i just realised i talk without annunciating or conviction and just loud enough so they can hear to avoid the interaction from carrying on so the attention isnt on me too long now this is a problem a people will think youre timid and take advantage the thing is i can talk clearly and loudly if i want but then youre inviting attention so i avoid it but it just annoying a clear communication is vital in work relationship socialising definitely something i need to work on,anxiety1004,so i am a sophomore at college but i have yet to actually declare my major at first i wa planning on studying economics but after a lot of consideration i instead plan to follow my passion in philosophy and minor in economics instead however when people ask about this i have been saying that i still plan to study econ because i am too embarrassed to tell them my real intention out of fear i will be looked down upon and made fun of for studying a useless degree and now i feel like i have dug myself this hole that it will make it even weirder when i actually tell them what i am really studying instead also no one in my friend group is interested in philosophy or the liberal art and are all studying stem related degree making me feel like even more of an outlier in this regard im tired of pretending im someone im not but i really am struggling to tell people the truth any tip,anxiety1005,im not sure but i think i have this along with social anxiety ive been having issue with anger and lashing out when im criticized or when i think i have been i just get angry and then spew my hate this happens online not so much in real life but this behavior isnt me i have selective mutism so i dont talk to people online like in game i dont do voice or text chat but when im criticized i either shut down or fly into a rage and say mean thing to them i dont even know how im capable of that when i cant even talk to them at alljust wondering if other people here have this if so any tip on how to

in her adult year but she ha always been very outspoken not afraid to stand her ground i not only have social anxiety but a complex issue with avoidance personality disorder and extremely low selfworth thats why i feel i never get any better over the year if anything i seem to get worse my friend is completely tired of my excuse a she say and ha said that i just want to be miserable and i will end up friendless and with no partner all alone these word hurt me because i feel she is failing to see my struggle she is getting tired of me making excuse a to why i cant do activity with her and our other friend i try to explain that my mental health is very low at the moment but she just brush it away with we all have mental struggle but we have to keep pushing ourselves last summer i got convinced to go travel with them even though i said i didnt want to because i wa afraid to bring the mood down both my friend said it is ok and we will not do any high activity when i got there i could tell my friend just got more and more annoyed at my indifferent behavior i did join almost all the activity but my energy wa low then my friend ha enough and burst out why did you even come here at that moment i felt like a complete fool i just wanted to go back home i knew my behavior would not be tolerated thats why i didnt want to come to begin with i tried to explain this but all she

overwhelmed by everything i just want to end this vicious circle but i cant just help ,anxiety1066,one advantage ive found of being socially anxious is im able to save more money a ive not got much of a social life and dont go out of my way to make plan whereas having an active social life can be very expensive and make it almost impossible to save another advantage of this is i dont drink much alcohol or do drug which im more likely to do with friend or at social event which obviously ha it long term physical health benefit i know some of u would much rather be social mastermind than save a bit of money but i guess it a small silver lining doe anybody else think like this,anxiety1067,a the title say im considering moving onto med now leading into my final year of school year  i wouldnt describe my social anxiety a debilitating a i have many friend that ive been able to form over the year but when it come to speaking to girl and sometimes even with friend those negative thought can

mood swing or any other nasty side effect that could threaten my grade so thats why im coming to you guy to see what you think thank you in advance,anxiety1068,dont know if this is the right place to post this here but yeahi guess this started back in late october i have these two close friend that i have that are dating let call them casper and kenny all name are fake name for safety i became really good friend with them back in august of  i wa the outcast that wa accepted by casper and his group of friend over that time i got pretty close with a few of them but mostly with casper and kenny we all talked and texted practically every day and for long period of time we all watched show and played online game on discord we were super close there were a few time when we hung out irl durring these hang out it non stop fun kenny is usually one of the two i go to when i need someone to talk to he been kind of the shoulder for me to cry on when stuff go on in my life it been a really big help in my mental health since i deal with depression and anxietyafter maybe a year of this being consistent it ha died down considerably over that time the amount of talking ha gone down the texting ha practically come to a stop with the occasional hey get on discord text i didnt think much of it since we were still playing game and watched a couple of show still fast forward to late october of  and they introduce someone new to the friend group let call them tyler tyler come into the group and he is the nicest guy ever the one thing that stick out is that tyler is coming in with being pretty close with casper and kenny from what they said they met online back in august he start joining in on server voice channel and hung out with the larger group at some point in early mid november he actually came along and hung out with the three of u this is when i truly noticed how much closer the three of them were than i wa i did my best to just mask up and play along it wa hard not to feel like garbageaside from that during the voice call i feel that i am always hearing about how much they talk and text each other and how much they enjoy it this is when i knew i wa basically being replaced what cemented it wa when they started hanging out without me having more inside joke and how i wa being fourth wheeled a i am writing this i am currently hanging out with casper and tyler and i wa essentially dragged a a third wheel that spark that i had wa snuffed out this is where i knew that i wa replaced for good they found someone that they liked and grew closer with in le time than i had i know im jealous of tyler but he is the sweetest guy and i know it not his intention of replacing me so i cant be mad or upset at him anyways i guess i just wanted to get that off my chest i might post this to other subreddits too any and all advice is appreciated,anxiety1069,so some time ago i started liking one of my classmate but i never really had the courage to go straight

bullied for a few year and also had a hard time with my parent who were perhaps not the best parentsi had a very good teacher during middle school who probably knew that i didnt have it so easy when it came to my classmate a i said wa bullied so she treated me very kindly during the two year i had her she always sat by me during lunch at school when no one else wanted to she always took a few minute to talk to me in the hallway or beforeafter class because she knew i had a hard time with friend etc i really want to contact her and just thank her for seeing me and being there for me but i dont know if i dare,anxiety1092,m i am an extremely introverted and a socially anxious person i did not have friend during childhood even growing up my classmate and friend would buy all these latest and trendy gadget and clothes and game and then there wa me who never really understood the hype about those thing and thus never bought them sometimes i felt kind of left out so i did ask my dad to buy thing for me but he mostly denied and even when i successfully managed to buy what i really wanted like a p  year ago i would rarely use it and that used to sicken him and he never bought me expensive thing and gadget afterwards unless it wa more of a requirement like a phone and a laptop now that im an adult with no job and in college i still rely on my dad for money and without him im basically homeless and jobless i dont know why even after my family being financially well off i feel guilty whenever i ask my dad to send over money other than grocery i do not like to spend money on anything no fancy clothes no fancy restaurant no expensive gadget nothing off amazon absolutely nothing although i desire all of these thing ive always wanted to join therapy but dont want to tell my dad that and hence i would not have money for it i need to consult a few doctor for some medical condition that i have but im afraid to tell my dad that and i dont have any money of my own and hence i am delaying my visit to the hospital whenever my friend upload story on instagram of them dining at fancy and expensive restaurant two day a week it difficult for me to comprehend where theyre getting all their money from because everybody i know get their money sent over to them by their parent and nobody work parttime or ha a job i just dont understand whats wrong with me i always have this fear that spending money on literally anything that is not of utmost importance will starve u financially and well be on the street in ragged clothes do you guy also have this fear or is it just me,anxiety1093,it becoming so popular for people to record stranger for literally anything for the way they look walk how you eat etc on tiktok ive seen so many people who are literally minding

attack,anxiety1094,m ive had low self confidence and anxiety for year and i find it difficult to talk to attractive woman my age and im now starting to realize part of the reason is that in both high school and college i wa made fun of or seen a a creep back then i didnt have good social etiquette and stared at people way too much by attractive girl in my class ive been able to improve my social skill and appearance slightly in the last two year of course there always room for improvement but im not sure how long it would take or what i would have to do for me to overcome my anxiety and low confidence i think my mind ha been somewhat traumatized by these experience so i now default to thinking thats how all the attractive woman will behave towards me,anxiety1095,ill write here

but over a few year ive put a lot of time into researching the disorder and into myself and believe im in a position to help others there are a lot of thing i wish i knew a few year ago so it would be nice for you guy out there to learn earlier and beat this horrible disorder a soon a possibleim sure many thing i talk about would also be of benefit to female but im in a much better position a a male to give advice which is why ive focussed this post on male im also straight im sure many of the thing i talk about will also be useful to gay individual but a lot of my advice will be tailored to heterosexual malesits a bit of a long read but i do believe it worth readingfor the rest of the post i will just refer to social anxiety a sadating my experience with dating wa that it wa impossible while i wa in the grip of sa i would download dating apps in the hope of talking to girl and yet would question everything i wrote and get down when a conversation turned badlymy advice is dont go near dating apps dating apps especially apps like tinder nowadays are more like instagram than anything else people post only the best side of themselves and many girl are on there only to gain a following hence why they often put their instagram handle in their bioa much better way to date is through meeting people in real life whether it through work acquaintance or hobby through this you will also learn from experience how to speak with others and socialise better i will touch on this exposure part later a it is one of the fundamental aspect of beating sawhen dating or even when generally speaking to girl it is imperative you dont put them on a pedestal for the younger of u this is called simping  and it is one of the most unattractive thing a guy can do this may sound controversial so please debate me in the comment if you disagree but a a guy naturally  time out of  it is your role to lead and for a woman to follow youyou are expected to arrange date and especially in the early stage of dating reach out and speak to themthe best way i found to increase my attractiveness towards girl is to give myself a many option a possible in year one of university i pretty much fell for my flatmate after she gave me the littlest amount of attention i had never been intimate with a girl so it wa unsurprising i felt that way i wa getting carried way ahead in my head even thinking i would marry her one day unfortunately thats not the way life go it no surprise she rejected me but after a while of living with her i realised she wa a completely different person to who i thought she wa and i would never think about dating her now i also put myself in her shoe shes just moved country wanting to meet new people and live her life and suddenly shes living with a guy obsessing over her  it not really a recipe for true love even if thats what i wanted to seewhen looking for someone it important to be friendly and talk to a many woman a possible by asking friend to introduce you to their friend or meeting them through university or at work they will let you know and give you the sign if they are into you and thats when you start flirting and go for itmasturbation your libido or horniness a a guy is really a force to be reckoned with if you use it correctly it give you the drive to speak to woman and set up date and having sex or dating is a key aspect of selfworth for many men including me porn and masturbation kill your libido im not against all porn i still jack off here and there especially when ive had a dry spell from sex  there nothing wrong with that but it imperative that you are watching the right kind of porn if you do watch porn i would advise watching the amateur kind particularly video of loving couple with foreplay involved this will reinforce to your brain what normal intimacy look like  which mean when it come to it and you have sex you will have the right preconception in mind of what good healthy sex look like and how to give a lady a good time  rather than most of the stuff you see on the front page of pornhub  which in real life is really not that enjoyable for a lot of femalesmedication the single most beneficial thing in improving my sa wa starting a mg dose of sertraline zoloft other ssri are sometimes used but sertraline is often offered first ssri are not perfect i will expand on this later in the post however they do work for a large number of people and i cannot speak highly enough about how they have helped my sa it is imperative that when starting a dose of an ssri you wait a full  week before giving up or moving onto another dosedrug the number of people i see on this subreddit or rzoloft complaining about ssri when they didnt even give their brain enough time to adjust pain mepssd many people online on reddit especially have complained about pssd this is called postssri sexual dysfunction essentially it is a condition where the sexual side effect of ssri continue after discontinuation of an ssri dose i have so much sympathy for those affected by this condition and i cannot imagine emotional pain those affected have however it imperative to state that very few people are affected by this conditionmany people hear about pssd and straight away go down the reddit rabbit hole looking for any example of pssd they can find it a classic case of confirmationbias you may find hundred of example of pssd but there are hundred of million of others who have taken these drug discontinued them and gone on with their life without experiencing pssdalcoholdrugs i have tried many drug over the year in the hope of finding something that would help my sa some helped in the short term some didnt i will briefly go over themcannabismarijuana weed is often promoted a a drug that can decrease anxiety in my experience in the very short term this wa true i started smoking weed around age  and for a while it wa great i could go out with my mate smoke a joint and have a good time however a time went on i noticed i wa getting more and more anxious smoking around my mate eventually i ended up having a panic attack after smoking im at a point now where i never smoke weed weed can help some people but in my experience it never beneficial in the long term for people with underlying mental health condition especially anxietycbd i tried cbd very briefly in my experience it did not help at all and wa a waste of money im sure other people have had good experience with it but it wasnt for mealcohol alcohol is one of the only drug i truly believe that can help people with sa only in the short time however weve all been there a few drink down and suddenly we feel like a social butterfly a our sa melt away it a fantastic feeling but weve also all been there  the morning after when we wake up with a tight feeling in our chest and suddenly the anxiety is back again considerably worse for someone with sa alcohol can be a tool it can be used in moderate amount to loosen up our tongue and make u more personable however it must be used with caution because for many people with sa it can become a crutch something we rely on to function properly  and ultimately lead to alcoholismself carelove we can all agree that confidence is attractive  whether it shown in a woman or a man the single most important thing in becoming more confident is selflove you must see yourself a an individual with value in life if you cant love yourself do you really expect anyone else to love you this is a key aspect of cbt cognitive behavioral therapy it the idea that yourself and your thought are separate for those with sa we often spiral in our own head about how we are perceived and this can lead to u giving ourselves a very low self worth by instead challenging those negative thought that come up or even discussing them with a very close and trusted family memberfriend we can change our perception of ourselves and start valuing ourselves higher this will inturn improve our confidence and make u much more attractive peopleappearance a someone with sa you probably dont have a lot of thing going for you hell i didnt so you must shift the balance in your favour the single biggest thing you can start doing today is working out and eating healthierever notice how bigger in shape people naturally command more respect they might be walking in the club or the workplace and there seems to be an aura of confidence around them it a fact of life that these people are more successful in the workplace and dating and you know the best thing about it anyone and i truly mean it anyone can get in shape the best place to go is to the gym all the equipment is there for you and there even the bonus of facing up to your fear and getting out there in public you might be too anxious to go to the gym i certainly wa at first and thats okay the great thing is you dont need a gym to get in shape everything can be done at home just buy a set of dumbbell and startthis

for a refund just remember to send them back in the refund periodexposure exposure is another thing that will help you if you suffer from sa one of the biggest symptom of sa is avoiding social situation by doing this you set yourself on a cycle of first avoiding social situation which in turn reinforces the internal belief that you cannot cope in social situation the way to break this cycle is by slowly exposing yourself to the situation that give you anxiety start in small step for some of you it may be simply going for a walk in public for others it may be striking up a conversation

feel my heart race whenever a family member chooses to start a conversation with me i sort of freeze up and end up accidentally saying something stupid or making the situation awkward either because i didnt want to bother asking them to repeat their question or because i couldnt pay close enough attention to what they were saying because the haze of anxiety that i would feeli would think that after many year of being in the adult world and functioning independently i wouldnt be experiencing this problem anymore but it turn out that almost nothing ha changed besides the fact that i have slightly better conversation skill,anxiety1101,i feel like i have thrown so much away already i am  and i have spent most of my life being anxious and wondering what others think of me i am scared of wasting

university graduate from india and currently live there in a metropolitan urban area i am preparing for some exam right now and also doing a full time internship along with it in a big accounting firmi have always been a pretty anxious kid growing up and wa deeply attached to my parent who basically sheltered me and validated every fear i had of new thing in life very basic thing like hygiene grocery shopping small talk with family are very foreign to me since i wa basically allowed to be on my laptop or watch tv in my room from the age of  onwards without any supervision i had friend at school and i wa a good student so i never really felt that my anxiety wa something that should concern meand yeah life wa good apart from the occasional teenage embarassments that we all go throughonce school ended and i had to go to college i thought of myself a an interesting person who can be funny and thoughtful and assumed that i would make a lot of friend just like at school it wa very very difficult because i spent most of my time trying to maintain good grade which wa much trickier than it wa in school in my first year  had to delete social medium for a few month and when i came back i had lost all my school friend my best friend of  year had picked a fight and kicked me out of her group and suddenly no one wanted to be friend with the awkward girl from school it devastated me a lot to lose everyone like that and when i did get the grade i wanted i had no one to share it with the anxiety got much worse then and i refused to get out of the house because i thought i might run into all these people and break down all  year of college passed without any significant friendship and while i do have a group of  girl whom i love they all have their own school community college and work group and it get really hard being the only one who want to hang out anymore because all the others have better option for friend i keep stalking my school friend on an insta i made just to snoop and find myself getting angry at them and myself for how thing unfolded meanwhile i am not able to connect with anyone at work or make friend because im rather quiet and dont really party or go clubbing because it is really overwhelming i also have a myriad of health issue that id rather not get into which have linkage with anxiety and depression im also not the best looking person i have bad skin hair and im really thin and short which ha affected my confidence a lot i have never been asked out or even had guy friend because guy especially seem to just be turned off by my general demeanori saw a psychiatrist a couple of year back who pretty much said there nothing wrong with me and that i shouldnt  think too much but my mood and behaviour concern me a lot i genuinely dont feel any connection to the world and tbh the only reason im living even is because of my parent i had a conversation with a family member recently who suggested that i dont bring anything to the table or have an interesting life and top of that i make people uncomfortable hence no one want to be friend with mei need some advice on how to make friend  real one this time and not drive people away im open to any and all suggestion,anxiety1118,tw  short mention of medication xanax abuse at the endi know this ha been discussed before over the year but i have always struggled

social anxiety i suffer from selective mutism a well i no longer go to therapy bc i believe only i can help myselfso i gave myself the task to join video call with my online friend so i can talk on

a m and for pretty much a long a i remember i have always had an issue with thinking that people hate me over the smallest thing either said that i interpret or really over anything for a lot of my youth i would feel this all the time and i ended up essentially buying friendship to satisfy my mind that people dont hate me but a i became an adult that is much harderi feel this way like over anything let it be ignored or talked over in a conversation someone make fun or dislike something i like someone criticizes something i do or think and i interpret it a said in a nonconstructive way thinking i am being talked about in secret i remember specifically a time where my friend sat across from me on the bus they both covered their face and whispered to themselves while looking at me and i became very anxious they were talking bad about me that i immediately got off the bus and cancelled our plan because of it feeling this way cause me to feel so awful and sick feeling to the point where a few time this happened and i carried this feeling to my place of work i ended up quitting said job when a manager said something to me during the shift that i ended up also thinking that they hated me or they think my work is so bad that i should just quit to let someone better workthe time where it the worst is when a friend of mine would actually get mad at me over something i do or said and it would lead me to have some real dark thought in which i would believe it would make everyone happy because everyone hate me or i would do stuff smaller like stop eating or selfostracize myself after feeling like since they hate me they ostracize me so to make others happy i should just not be seen or heard fromthese thought have made it very very difficult to make new friend and just be open in general i never talk about myself to anyone including my friend really about anything i do or like i almost never post on social medium and if i do i often get no interaction and i end up feeling disliked and i end up deleting said post i always wanted to play online game or do thing online with people and make friend but i find it very difficult a welli hate feeling like this and i dont know what to do this constantly feeling ha really fucked my personality up and ha prevented me from doing a lot of thing i want to do due to immediately thinking that shit will go bad and people will hate me ignore me or ostracize me even when it come to being on the internet and even holding a job,anxiety1122,for example you know how if youre about to swear in front of a  year old you

walking down a quiet road anxiety isnt a thing right now nothing crazy happening then a person walk by they seem nice and they say hi you reply kind of awkwardly and try to say hi and it doesnt really sound right it come out weird you beat yourself up about it you mumble to yourself wtf are you doing youre an idiot or fill in the blank that person hears you omg it the end of the world they reply with youre ok it all good it didnt bother me how would that make you feel would that make you feel better about the situationnow imagine youre having a bad day that same person show up they say hey im here if you need me i wont bother you but im here if if you do need me no pressure pretend this person becomes the best friend possible every time youre down theyre there to cheer you up they say thing that make you feel better think of the kind of thing that perfect person could say that would cheer you up maybe it just no judgment and some silence maybe it just reassurance saying everything is going to be ok im here maybe right down some sentence that perfect person would say to younow you might have already guessed where this is going what if you were that perfect friend that knew what you needed what if you were that best friend to yourself what if you were the one cheering yourself up when it wa needed what if you told yourself in those awkward social situation you know it going to be ok what if you told yourself dont be so hard on yourself this is called selfcompassion i recommend looking it up there are some great book on it when it come to personal situation i remember every time i did something awkward id beat myself up about it i never make any progress because of this and hated every situation because i always made it a negative experience for myself the day i started being my own best friend and being kinder to myself wa the day those awkward situation started to not matter a much and because of this my anxiety started to fade and because of that my

brother and his girlfriend i had such a good time but now that im home and decompressing i cant stop this thought loop that im stuck inive always had issue with going out with friend and having a good time but then becoming super anxious about stuff when i get home the time i had couldve been completely perfect but my brain will always latch onto something and then i just spiral and spiral until i end up having a panic attackanyway this friend i went with ha actually helped me with my social anxiety an insane amount since i met him and honestly i stopped having anxious thought after doing thing with him for a long time but today it happening again and it hitting me really hard i just keep cycling through the same worry and i cant stopwe were planning this snowboarding day for a while and i asked him to be the one to teach me considering he been doing it since he wa young and is fairly good at it he planned on just spending this whole day with me teaching me the basic but now i cant stop feeling guilty about it he knew he wa going to spend the whole day teaching me and we both knew i wa going to be pretty bad at it obviously since again it wa the first time ive ever done it but i cant help but feel that he didnt have a good time just watching me fail over and over for hour and not being able to go and just do his own thing with his gf and brother i know that he did have a good time but my brain wont let it go and stop telling me he didnt i can manage to shake these thought off by simply telling myself that we both already knew that the day wa going to go the way it did but then my mind just hit me with alternate anxiety to stress over instead when those one dont affect me enough now im sitting here thinking what if i didnt make a good first impression with his brother or gf what if i wasnt talking enough or being entertaining enough what if i wa super boring and they dont want to go out with me again because honestly with being nervous about learning to snowboard on top of meeting new people it all starting to feel overwhelming i dont want to go to him with my concern even though i probably will end up doing that anyway just because i know and he know that i have an overthinking problem and i know he going to tell me not to worry about it and that it wa very fun and he is happy that i am making the effort to learn and get into snowboarding but even with me knowing that i cant control my mind it like it is it own separate entity that feed me negative thought and i cant get it to stopim trying so hard right now to not go into the overthinking death spiral but i think im losing that fight right now which is why im making this post im trying to think of all the good moment to counter my negative thought but my mind make me feel like all of the bad moment are just too overpowering in comparison to the good one losing control of my thought like this drive me insane and cause me to feel extremely depressed and that im going to lose everything ive built with this friend all over one single day a day that i know logically wasnt all bad i dont know what to do i feel like i have to apologize to him for every single thing thats getting to me i know i should just go to bed and when i wake up it wont feel a bad but i also know that laying in my bed is going to cause me to toss and turn for hour thought looping endlesslynot experiencing this problem

lot of mental health issue that cause a lot of challenge in my daytoday life i look around on the internet and there are a lot of people sharing their story and i want to share mine a well so i thought the best place to start would be my first panic attackmy first panic attack happened when i wa yearsold about  year ago in my grade  physic class  we had a reading period for the first  minute of our second class everyday when everyone wa silent sat at their desk and got to read whatever book they had at the time i personally loved reading period but something wa different that day and it wasnt something i could really predict i didnt feel any different going into the class but a soon a i sat down it startedi sat at my desk in the front row and the classroom wa completely silent i started to feel this sensation in my chest and in my leg quickly buildinga numb tingly feeling in my leg and a tightness in my chest my heart started to beat fast and my breathing started getting short if youve ever experienced a panic attack you know that these are the telltale sign but i had no idea what wa happening i wa very uncomfortable so i immediately ran out of the room in front of the whole class which wa not not the best feeling in the world a i wa feeling all these sensation it became very uncomfortable and i wasnt sure what i needed but i wa positive about what i did not need and that wa to be in the classroom any longer i bolted for the door and ran out of the classroom down the hall to the bathroom and just needed a private place to figure out what wa going on at the time i had no clue what i wa experiencing and thought i might have been having a heart attack i had no idea that it wa mental whatsoever obviously it had physical symptom but i didnt know that it wa a panic attack in fact i hadnt even heard of a panic attack at that time in my life i remember being in that bathroom terrified and not even knowing what i wa terrified of like most panic attack it peaked after about  minute and then slowly died away but i wa definitely prepared to go into the hall and get someone to call  or get me to the school nurse to be looked at because i genuinely thought i wa going through a physical attack of some sort at the time it wa very traumatizingthe way the class were set up i had that physic class in the same period for the entire week so i had reading period for the first  minute again the following day i walked into the same class sat down to do my reading and again the same sensation hit me i ran out of the class and i hid away in the washroom waiting for it to go awayit wa around that time that i suspected it wa not physical and wa more mental but i had no idea what wa happening before this point in my life i wa definitely an anxious kid growing up i had struggle with mental health before that point in my life but it wa the first time i had experienced something that severe and grippingessentially every reading period after that i had to sit in the hallway and read because i didnt know what the cause wa but i wa severely uncomfortable being in the classroom in any of my class when reading period occurred a time went on i learned about myself my anxiety my thought process and i learned that reading period wa a trigger for my anxietyit wa one of the thing that would cause panic attack for me because it wa a situation that i felt i couldnt escape from but at the time i had absolutely no idea what wa going on i didnt know what a panic attack wa i didnt know what wa happening to me or why and i didnt know what wa causing it all i knew wa that this thing wa having a large impact on my day so i started taking my book and reading outside in the hall for those  minute for all my class of course there are a lot worse situation i could have been inat least i wa comfortable in the hallway and didnt have panic attack anymore but the point i want to hit on is how uneducated i wa and and just how naive i wa about what i wa going throughif i had known what i know now it definitely would have helped me in the long run a lot sooner to identify panic attack and that reading period wa one of the trigger of a panic attack i dont know why they started but the great thing about anxiety panic attack and a lot of mental health issue is that you dont need to know what caused them or why they started all you have to know is your present situation and learn the skill and solution to your current situationso if youre going through any of these thing a well or something even slightly similar then were in the same boat and i think that hearing other people story and learning about their experience can really help u with understanding our own circumstancesif i had other people story to read about when i wa in grade  i would have been able to identify the panic attack i would have started looking up resource for panic attack why they were happening to me and coping mechanism for them i would have discovered meditation and learned breathing exercisesi went through a long period of stumbling through the dark so i think that the major benefit of u sharing story with each other is that those of u who are stumbling through the dark can learn different resource i think it can shine the light onto the dark corner of mental health that we otherwise wouldnt receive so thats all i really want to do by sharing my story with youif there anything that i want to leave you with it that you are so much stronger than you know and you need to remember that you are capable of so much more than you believe it is so important to have faith in yourself even when you feel weak because it help u get through those really tough time like panic attacksi also made a video about this on my youtube channel which

pretty severe history of social isolation and social phobia that got a lot better throughout the last decade now f now the first time in a situation where i am stable enough to actually go outside and try to make friend by myself i even found a wonderful new partner this wayi challenge my negative self belief im not interestingentertainingsmartfunny etc enough by putting myself out there that is i meet up with people and try to talk to them about my life and to share thing i did or saw or what i feel or just stuff thats going on with me a lot of the time many people just react by saying okay and thats it and that literally leaf me feeling so dejected and concluding like why did i even bother to talk to them in the first place like i put myself out there and if this is all i get what do i do it for because in the end im the one sitting there feeling shitty about myself because of thissometimes when i feel happier or more confident i think i interact in different way and then i dont think i care much what people think or i also think they react differently to me so i dont know if it just the way i project my insecurity on other people or if my conversation style is weird or if there something wrong with me and i am so incredibly frustrated by this and i need to fix it because it just making me want to isolate againlike i do my best to react normally and to have actual conversation or dialogue with people when they tell me about their life but it never feel mutual even with my boyfriend he generally encourages me to talk and want me to share what is going on but i never feel like there is a normal conversation coming out of it or maybe im just currently generalising because i feel like shit about myselfi have one or two friend with whom this isnt an issue and with whom i generally like to talk because i feel there are actual conversation happening that i am involved in rather than just being a sounding board for the other person but i just dont understand

deal jump to the th paragraph if not into detailsi used to perform at the church when i wa a kid and at some other event a well i dont know how i managed to do it but i clearly remember how terrified i would get sweaty palm dry mouth which sucked i couldnt control my breathing properly which mess the whole thing up  you cant sing if you cant control your breath into adolescence i pretty much put singing and performing on hold even though i still went ton to learn some guitar and whatnot only a few year ago i wa diagnosed with sad and did several month of behavioral therapy and that helped me a lot both for general anxiety and social anxiety i learned to care le about people perception of me i learned that they dont even think about me and my mind make me think they do the biggest lesson i learned however ill say is about ruminating i pretty much wiped it out i dont go back and think about thing that happened nearly a much a i used to so yesterday i went out to perform on the street with my roommate weve been rehearsing for a month i shouldve been way more scared even from rehearsing and dont get me wrong i still feel anxious during the first song we performed i wa still a bit nervous my mouth got dry and i couldnt catch my breath at time and skipped some word but by the second song i wa calmer and could sing better people walked by and stopped to take a listen and record somepeople waved and some smiled at me i went back home after we were done thinking to myself holy shit i did it wtf i still wish i could get rid of the physical symptom tho one thing lead to another

say that i generally enjoy itthe problem lie with taking the first step for example at work if someone come to me and asks if i want to have a coffee with them i will often say no or make an excuse because saying yes is a big step for me even if they are the one askingthis is the main problem for me and it can be extrapolated to many other situation but for example if my manager say we are all going to have a coffee i cant say no so i have to go and i usually end up enjoying iti also tend to think the new people i meet are talking to me because they want to be polite or x but thinking it reasonably they probably like me because they try it several time but i just try to end the conversation so i dont lose their timeis this happening to any of you i want to make friend a i have been

and comfortable with the more senior member than i am right now i sort of get away with being awkwardtimid since im the youngest member of my work group by a good margin engineering but i feel like eventually theyll hire another fresh college grad who will be more well adjusted social and smarter than me and that ill be so unbearably ashamed and have to leave on the spotthese are feeling ive had for awhile but man social event have a way of acutely reminding me of them a a side note one of my new coworkers is a beautiful lady and being around beautiful girlswomen always depresses me on top of that despite the fact that shes very friendlykind to me there this look of pity she give me from  time to time when i fumble my word or look visibly anxious it brief but so so incredibly soul crushing

long timeive started to rebuild my life ive got a job i like now but i pretend pretty funking hard to be calm and collected and no one can tell any different i tend to do fine and people think im alright until they say something like ill be your friend and i just sort of go into meltdown ive been on my own for a long time and ive lost context for what is normal ive gotten so happy and excited to have someone who say they want to be my friend that i massively overdo it on the communication by contrast this person is not a great communicator it seems and i have been carrying on in this new normal of opening up and trying to talkim getting so anxious about it i manage to go all day without messaging because it feel like im being a burden and being clingy and then message anyway because ive spent all day rationalising why it okay because they said they want to be friendsthe nature of the abusive relationship mean i now want to apologise for breathing i try not to but i become a mess and a wreck when encountering poor communication and it worse not knowing whether people dont mind that i just babble away because i feel safe to do so for a changei feel like i should be apologising for having been trying to talk too much for sending a small message each day for example for being enthusiastic for wanting to make plan for misinterpreting thing when in reality i might be piecing together a narrative that i havent even been fully toldhow do you set the line between having done something wrong and apologising for it or for just being yourself and being happy and excited to have someone in your life when do you apologise for just being yourself and do you ever need toall i want is to be understood by someone and it feel like apologising for thing i may have done but dont know ive done to someone who say that they are your friend is needed and that ive not respected a boundary somewhereoh and also this person ha come onto me multiple time and most recently when ive addressed it and been like yo this either need to  go somewhere or not go somewhere ive gotten all fucked up all i want is to be fine because i like being around themi dont know whats what and im trying really hard to maintain a level but im failing ive been alone for too long to see thing how i used tois it a bad idea to apologise for having reached out so much or to admit that i havnt been doing well and have reached out too much a a result im just so tired of being sorry and just want to establish a way of being myself,anxiety1197,i get so much anxiety when receivingresponding to

to me but lately it felt that we were becoming distant and i thought that it wa normal a she had people who were her age and closer to her than me although it hurt a bit cause so i talked with her cause ik communication is key and we sorted thing out and she even apologisedi wasnt looking for an apology yesterday to me wa amazing because we finally reconnected after a lot of time of me thinking id fully lost herwe were with other teammate and in the middle of the conversation one of the girl asked if her gift wa good i didnt know to whom and i thought it wa someone birthday so i asked my bstf so i dont seem dumb with anyone else and she replied yeah shes getting a gift for m is m birthday around this time i didnt know that i said dumbfounded  no like secret santa she said see our team is consisted of an odd number of people but uk i thought theyd at least have the common decency to ask me how they hid it so well i might never know im not blaming anyone and i know it not some kind of conspiracy against me but it still kinda stung im too embarrassed to ask some of my close friend if that secret santa thing wa with the whole team or just specifically that friend group with in the

i could reply to him wa wow thats interesting uhhuh etc i think i can only have some kind of conversation with my only friend and thats just because we share a couple of interestsand i dont know how to fix that ive read about exposure therapy and i personally think ive had enough exposure for the past several month yet i havent progressed a single bit when i got the job i had a one week training

recently heart somebody say this in title and this really resonated with me i tent to overestimate the intelligence or experience or skill of everybody around me so that i start feeling intimidated and stupid but nobody know everything one might be eloquent and good at presenting argument but this doe not mean that this person is an expert on every topic and always know what they are talking about or an other person could be good at math and understand basic logic but is also missing some the fact and come to the wrong conclusion or the other way around i belief we or at least i often thing if a person know a lot about topic a it is also likely that they are good at doing task b and this is most of the time just not true nobody is generally smart or intelligent all the time you might just see the one thing they are really good at right now of course that is not a great new revelation but it could be useful to be reminded most people suck at most thing so it is perfectly okay if you do a well i dont know i like this idea and it help a bit sorting thing in my head and if it doe the same for anyone else i am very happy,anxiety1230,we started opening our present the first

year i basically dont have social life and meeting people ha been a really challenge for me today i tried to get over my anxiety and decided to go to christmas dinner with my fam and i felt so isolated and kinda dumb and boring i didnt talk with anyone there i hardly talk with my family i just see my aunt and my cousin once a year and it kinda hard for me to be confident with them and start a conversation i just sat there and saw them talking while i didnt said a word i couldnt even see them at they eye and of course i feel so guilty about it i dont even know what to say how to behave and i honestly dont care about theyre talking about im other word i feel so out of place like i dont fit it when when i try to say something i feel so stupid all the time doe anyone relate to this

celebrated christmas eve with my family my next goal right now is to order from a starbucks with a gift card i wa gifted a couple day back but i have been stalling on it and i have to do it when im by myself because thats when im most uncomfortable,anxiety1240,and the sad thing is with my sa im kinda relieved  my holiday plan were disrupted when i woke up a week ago with a sore throat and runny nose  a the week went on  my body did little to shake the virus and i wasnt thrilled at the prospect of  hour drive to my folk house for christmas in below freezing temp  i told my parent that it risky making that kind of drive in dangerous cold weather  my dad agreed  therefore i had the perfect reason not to go this year and miss christmas for the first time in my lifebut if im honest with myself i probably wouldnt have wanted to go even if i felt great and the weather wa perfect  every year christmas ha diminished for me  it used to be a holiday that i loved and enjoyed celebrating with my family  but the dynamic changed once my niece grew up and started bringing their boyfriend to the family get together  now stranger had invaded my social circle and the discomfort of sa creeped in  and of course these guy never talked to me  thats the way it always go  i have to make the first move  our typical christmas celebration would be meeting at my sister house for a big lunch and then exchanging gift   over the past few year the gift giving became le and le of an event for me  my parent are too old and feeble to put any effort into holiday shopping so they always just give me money  i would get gift for my niece and they would do one for me   it ha degraded to such a ridiculous level that one year we pretty much just gave each other the same amazon gift card  last year it stung a bit when my niece went to sort out the gift to each person and i only had one gift to open  the fucking boyfriend got more gift than me  it not like the number of gift i got matter that much to me but it wa the feeling like i didnt really matter any more  the boyfriend had stolen my social comfort from christmas and the gift giving wa no longer a fun and exciting part of christmas for me  since i have no friend i will be spending christmas alone with my cat and part of me is happy to avoid the alternative,anxiety1241,hello lovely people i need some advice im  living in wa

mission,anxiety1299,there wa  of u in a group and we had been friend since  we met during start of our college year so it wa easier to hang out with each other those day now all of u in our  s i started to realize that i dont consider them a my close friend anymore in our group we have a person who really smart went to good school got a good job and in a sense wa very mature than u at a early age for some reason we all tend to agree with him or do anything that he suggest because in a some weird way we allowed him this authority possibly we all felt like he grew up to a real adult faster than u but i consider him to very trustworthy and can call on him any time of day to help anyone out the nd person is someone who wa goofy he never took school or his future seriously but he wa the fun one in on our group he just wanted to party drink and smoke but we all kind of felt he wa very immature for his age he kind of made the group fun  he always wasnt the smartest or the sharpest tool in the shed therefore anything he suggest or what his opinion were never taken seriously he had a fight with the first person smart i mentioned and he felt it wa best for him to leave the whole group so he left but me and him stayed in touch and every once while we hanged out with just u two i think the reason he only stayed in touch with me is because even though i made fun of some of suggestion  like every wake did i still listened to him before i diminished him he know i didnt call his idea stupid before he even  finished talking like the others the rd person and myself had a similar personality he wa bit le introvert than me we have similar interest we both play and watch sport liked similar movie  and food and for the most we were on the same page with almost anything i related to him much more than anyone else in the groupthe th person is who at our early year of our group  i wa really close with me and him hanged out a lot during college a year went by after we all turned  he sort of started to have this ego about him anything anyone say or do he like to correct them or tell them that theyre wrong whatever he say is the truth and the logical answer everyone else is wrong in a way i feel like he is fighting to take the spot of first friend i mentioned because anytime my smart friend say something or do he tends to agree with him and never really want to argue or dismiss anything he say also i started to realize he ha way to seeing other people a inferior to him and if he think youre lesser than him he will treat a a nobody nothing you say matter anything you say he will somehow turn it around make it a joke about you he always want people to think he the smartest one the room because of this th person i started to dislike our whole group anything i say or do he will dismiss me in front of everyone because im a bit introvert i think he see me a an inferior to him a well and he can say anything he want i think he started to see me a a replacement for the nd person goofy and left the group my opinion or suggestionsideas  dont matter im also in my s and i dont really have another group of people im close with i feel like if i snap or get angry at him it would be make everything sour and ill have nobody to talk to im not married or have gf this group is my social life i never really been alone before and because for that fear i tolerate him i started to feel like a nobody he would constantly bring up how quiet i am and how will i ever find a girl when im so quiet the reason im quiet it because i dont want him to have a chance to ridicule me each time it would make feel empty and hopeless inside there wa time after we hangout i hope to die in a car accident returning home at this age i think all of the year of being made fun of and being dismissal and how much it really turn me into an introverted person than before this is also effecting me at work coworkers are seeing me a a person that they can make fun and that they dont have to respect me because i wont do anything  there is never really a time where we chill in pair or in  it usually  of u or  of them st rd th i started to slowly made up lie to avoid hang out because i hate seeing him but then i realized how alone iam and thats sucked even more im started to think it would be better for me to cut all tie with this th person because i have been feeling like worthless over the year if i do this there is a high possibility i would loose friendship with the st and rd person a i mentioned  we never really hanged out  a group of  maybe if he gone in my life i can find my old self where i didnt have the feeling of being useless and unhappy im  writing all of this because i dont have anyone to vent off too ha anybody been in a similar situation a i am whats is your

to the bus on the sidewalk by clearing or stepping on some of the way i wa tired and wet and cold and a little high so i just said itd be nice to get some help with it which she affirmed but then just didnt respond further i just dont understand why im obligated to do so out of everyone were all standing waiting for the bus and where she wa standing had a lot le snow then my portion is it just because im a dude i dont want to get my hand and jean wet we had a weird little standoff where no one did or said anything and she eventually passiveaggressively cleared some of the snow while saying like this or some shit because i swear at this point i had my earbuds playing music and wa trying to tune out this bitch honestly i probably shouldnt have been vaping near the bus stop but i wa away from everyone else and it wa helping prepare me for a difficult work day,anxiety1302,i have been wanting to find some people who i feel like feel the same way a me and im so glad ive found this

the subject or the circumstance dont matter im smiling even if something sad like a death come up i struggle wiping the smile off my face i already cant remember a time where i didnt behave like this

happiness affection or laughter im tired of gifting my smile to every random person for free i want it to feel special for the people i hold dear and for myself im aware that this behavior of mine is most definitely a result of my childhood not allowing me to remotely look unhappy or displeased for if i do bad thing follow no worry i dont need this behavior anymore im independent and otherwise

for taking your time reading this post kind stranger good day to you,anxiety1318, realizing that having sa doesnt make you weird or creepy or dumb sa is extremely common and most people even if they dont have it chronically will experience some short period of sa in their life with this also come realizing that if you have chronic sa it will always be there but it doe get alot better over time  realizing that stranger only care about you for the few minute your interacting with them telling the waiter you to after they said enjoy your meal is akward but that waiter ha heard it at least once a day and wont remember you the next day think about the very few moment in a normal day you remember a week later that is equally true for everyone else do not give your self main character of the universe pressure  realizing that people already choose to be around you no one is forcing your family your friend your coworkers to interact with you in a social way those people would simply not interact with you if they didnt think your presence added at least something small to their life so if your being invited to a social gathering it because the host think the party will be better with you there no one willing invite a monster to dinner  realizing it better to just embrace the akward weird and cringe part of your personality the only difference between most akward moment being funny or being embarrassing is how your choose to react to it cry because you spelt your ice tea is embarrassing laughing about needing a shower make it a funny and quickly forgettable moment,anxiety1319,ha anybody tried group theraphy for social anxiety if yes what are your experience,anxiety1320,so yesterday evening i wanted to get some food at my fav place i got into my car

wore diaper while my classmate didnt i remember having to stand there and watch my peer getting into the van seeing that door slide closed and the van pulling away while i had to stay behind with the rest of the baby growing up nothing terrified me more than getting left behind whether it wa missing the bus after school getting left by a van at day camp scout youth group etc this story is related to thatwhen i wa  my dad and i signed up to go to mexico on a mission trip we would be joining people from other church from the northeast georgia region we carpooled with a group from augusta who picked u up on their way through town we continued west to texas and then across the border where we met the other group altogether there were about sixty of u we were divided into three team each of u building a house in earlier year my dad and i would work on the same house but we decided to switch it up this year the house we were building we simple by friday morning we were ready to present the key to the family in previous year these key ceremony would only be attended by the group that built the house but this year it wa decided that the whole group of sixty people would attend all three ceremony so we all had a chance to see the other house our house wa first after the ceremony we all went to the second site then the third the third house wa the most remote and it wa the house my dad had worked on after that ceremony people started making their way to their van my dad called me over and had one of the member of his team take our picture in front of the house it took about five minute at most after that they headed to their van and i headed to mine i got to where we parked only to see our van driving away without me i didnt bother chasing after them they were too far away i turned to where my dad van wa but they were already leaving i wa starting to panic when i noticed another van loading up they were far away but i knew the name of one of the people getting in and i called out to him he got them to wait and i ran over and climbed in i had to sit on a cooler but at least i managed to get a ride back to the hotel i wa pissed i wa also hurt i dont know why they left me i wa too afraid to ask because the answer would not have been good either they left because they didnt care or they thought so little of me a a person they didnt notice i wa missing i cant help but think they would have waited if it had been someone else watching that van drive off without me caused one of the worst feeling i could have imagined a mix of anxiety shame anger and depression i felt like curling up into a ball and cry i keep running this story over and over in my brain why did they leave me do they not like me wa it on purpose am i just obsessing over it because of my past trauma,anxiety1331,hi this is my first post ever i suppose i kind of want to vent kind of want advice or just an opinionive had sa for year but some month ago my mental health really took a hit cause i graduated but thanks to sa felt like i wa going to get nowhere in lifenow a major sa difficulty for me is interview and at this  point i wa like i am never gonna be able to do an interview so im never gonna get anywhere in life graduated and got a degree  but what wa the point if i wa never gonna attend an interview cause simply no interview  no jobtook me a very very long timebut i reached out for help and got some therapy sadly it didnt help a much  but im on the waiting for a higher intensity of cbt anyway since then im referring to like last week i forced myself to do  of the  interview i got offered online on team i did contact my gp a week prior to this and got some med but i told myself it didnt matter if it went horrendous i went blank the fact i would had taken that step would be a big deal for me personally  cause it wa avoid avoid escape which is why i did  and not  and even now is still my automatic response in my head after doing  interview now super unexpected but i got offered both job i expected no offer just doing the interview albeit online wa enough for me now here the issue and im beating myself up about it even though i should really see this a a big win  i get a lot of anxiety driving got my licence somehow  yr ago and i have barely driven sincejob   day a week will have to drive or use public transport  but it simply from a to b and backjob   day a week part of the job is a lot of driving every day to different location but job  link way more closely to what i want to domy degreenow i really really wanted to go for job  it is better experience for me will help more so for me to get to my goal  but i dont feel like im ready for the driving aspect i feel like im almost trying to do too much too fast and i know  i put myself in this situation by literally barely driving but also  i wasnt even ever planning to do the interview so i should take that a a winbut i feel like crap that just when i took a step for my anxiety by doing the interview it like here another barrier i suppose im asking is it stupid to go for job  which is also going to give me anxiety no doubt and will make me drive out of my comfort zone and letting a good opportunity pas because im not ready for the whole major driving all over the place atm or should i take job  and try and use that to build my confidence new placeppl work on driving to a different place back and from and slowly branch out and see that a a positive and apply for something like job  when i feel more ready im sorry for the ramble   i just feel so dissappointed in myself,anxiety1332,i just hate saying the wrong thing because i dont know what to say due to my lack of social skill from my social anxiety im saying this because my best friend told me her uncle had a heart attack so i didnt know what else to say besides dont worry itll be ok then she got mad at me and said thats literally the worst thing to say to someone so she cut me off i for now on never want to reply to someone again because i always screw thing up,anxiety1333,hiso there this girl that suddenly appeared back in my life after  year the last time i texted her and she left me on read i wa obviously hurt but i knew it wa going to come down to that since she wa only hanging out with me cuz she had no friend at the moment now i know she switched school and is also probably lonely and thats why shes reaching out to me again i have only  friend that im most of the time sure hate me but hang out with me out of pity i am very lonley and would normally accept her invitation but my therapist said i shouldnt since this girl hurt me a lot in the past she said some very nasty stuff to my face in front of our classmate in primary school multiple time and would often blame me for thing i didnt do the only good thing about her is we have a similar sense of humour and sometimes i actually had fun with herusually only when we were alone which is probably a bad sign anyways this is probably more of a vent then a question anymore since writing this out i think ill rather just stay at home,anxiety1334,i just leave a fast a i can lol,anxiety1335,i cant find a place to study i am even socially anxious around family so cant study at home i live in a crowded city so coffeshops are always crowded there arent many library nearby there always some noise or sound outside that is irritating there no place i can relax i feel like i live in a prison that is the world itself,anxiety1336,okay so im all for exposure therapy ive been pushing myself out of my comfort zone more often lately travelling alone eating out alone speaking to people etc my main observation with this is that sure it go help my confidence a small amount but mainly on a temporary basis i think this is due to adrenaline while im out but i find that once im home and in my own space again i sort of go back into my comfort hole and i have to work myself up again to go out there and build up this confidence adrenaline i live alone so dont have people around when im in this space secondly the exposure therapy doe nothing for my social awkwardness when i speak to people i still stutter take age to process a response say something wrongweird you name it classic awkward person so my question here is while exposure therapy is all great and stuff what do i do with the shame from my awkward moment i think the main cause of my social anxiety is due to social trauma  being rejected by peer being called weird or awkward which lead to shame which lead to pain which then lead to strengthening of the social fear so if the cause of the fear and pain is still there social rejection due to awkwardness how am i ever supposed to overcome this i cant see myself ever not being awkward i hope this make sense,anxiety1337,i am a m with a  year old daughter and partnerf  for the past  year or so and i have become a shell of the person i once wa i have always been socially awkward ive never went out of my way of to make friend or form romantic relationship they have all started with them talking to me first i am unable to form or start conversation with anyone including my girlfriend because i have absolutely no idea a to what people talk about a i have different interest and have a very unexciting life  when people do talk to me i avoid looking them in the eye and try to get myself out of the conversation a quickly a possible to avoid the awkwardness  one of my biggest fear is being with  people one which im comfortable with and the other not so much and the person im comfortable with leaving me alone with the other person with nothing to say to them just thinking of that situation make me sick inside  because of this i have developed an incredibly low self esteem which ha caused me to drop out of college because my last  remaining class are lab which require me to partner with another person and i am afraid of looking like unintelligent and like a social loser i have accepted that because of this i will never have a job that pay a decent wage because most that do require interpersonal relationship with coworkers i have never felt like i fit in with any group of people i do not find thing such a drinking and going to bar concert or any large social outing fun in anyway  i do not know how to act in these situation and am honestly very overwhelmed by them  i would much rather chill at my house with very close friend but it seems like nobody is interested in that anymore i have shut out all of my friend for what is going on probably  year because honestly i feel inferior to them because i do not dedicate my time to being great at one thing and have many hobby which i rotate through  i have a habit of  obsessing about my hobby for a period of  month so much so that i lose sleep over them and then lose interest in them until the burnout subsides my  friend play video game with people i do not know in while in discord and because of this i can not bring myself to talk to them anymore  i recently told my friend that ive been dealing with anxiety and that it wa the reason i hadnt been around  i started playing videogames with him one on one again but it wa always him doing all the talking and there would be a lot of silence during our session and eventually after about  month of this he started ghosting me which only confirms that i am a boring person and have no value  i have tried to put myself out there trying to join guild in world of warcraft but every multiplayer gamer expects you to join their discord channel voice chat and once it hit that point i leave the guild  honestly i cant even bring myself to play with people that i will see again voice chat or not a i am afraid of being inferior to them and letting them downthis cycle ha brought me to the darkest place i have ever been in and honestly no longer experience any positive feeling the only emotion i have now are anxious and sadness  i havent brushed my teeth in probably going on  week now and if my girlfriend didnt make me i wouldnt shower until the smell would make me sick  i just see myself a inferior to everyone and believe that im not worth it  i hope someone could give me advice or let me know that at least one other person out there is in the same boat a i am and how they manage with this issue,anxiety1338,half my colleague went on holiday today but i thought it wa only one of them so i wished that one person happy holiday yesterday and no one else i told my colleague that are here today that i didnt know and would have wished the others nice holiday too and they kinda chuckled i know it not a dramatic thing that i did and once everyone is back ill tell them my mistake and give them my belated holiday wish thats where i know the story should end but im sitting here almost frozen by embarrassment i cant focus on my work because my brain keep circling back to the fact that i made a mistake i know that no one will have thought i did anything maliciously my colleague are nice enough that i can trust them to not be upset or angry over something so silly but still even knowing all of that i cannot stop worrying and it driving me nut people will say shit like it all in your head yeah bro i know i want to get it out of there,anxiety1339,when im in a conversation with someone or maybe just in the same room with them i always seem to get this feeling that either im not in on the joke or the person doesnt want to be around me i feel like i have zero ability to honestly gauge if it my brain misrepresenting their body language  face and speech or if what im picking up is real so in short doe anyone know of a trick for knowing if it just your anxietyi could really use some clarity since im beginning to struggle to maintain friendship now because im afraid they dont want me around and so i end up ghosting for long period of time it been year and i could really use some people to talk to im tired of feeling like an island,anxiety1340,i know men struggle with social anxiety and trouble interacting but they have just a natural advantage over woman guy are le judgemental and it way easier to interact among a group of men because they literally dont care about superficial shit a lot of the time they can just vibewhen i meet woman i am instantly intimidated woman are often judge mental and can be stand off ish i feel like they are looking at me up and down and can sense my anxietyi love being a woman but i feel like it so much more difficult to make connection a a woman because we always seem to be in competition with one another,anxiety1341,i think i finally realized why i have so much trouble changing im afraid of what others will think of me when i start acting different it a weird situation because i know with  certainty that my life will be a thousand time better then it is now but im just too afraid to change for the past  month ive wanted to get rid of my social anxiety for good because i had fallen in love with this girl in my school and i realized that im not really someone people enjoy being around my crush is the complete opposite of me energetic the entire day and always talking were only in one class together where we sit with each other and so far ive only talked to her once in a while i guess im scared of changing because i dont know how classmate and teacher will react to me no longer being the quiet kid today happens to be my last day before winter break so if there any good time to do a complete  personality change it would be over a week long break how do i get over my fear of other people view on me,anxiety1342,i used to be better about it and managing my anxiety in general but for some reason ive backslid and now the thought of going out give me a pit in my stomach i obviously have to go grocery shopping sometimeand probably sooner than later seeing the state of my fridge but i just cant make myself go i always psych myself out of itis there anything that worked for you any advice welcome ,anxiety1343,im seeing a lot of people realize that they are actually autisticon the spectrumneurodivergent whats the difference between

believe it when i finally found someone just  minute from my house who is licensed in both training and pt when i met her i wa over the moon she wa exactly what i wa hoping for weve been doing sooo much progress ive been gushing to my friend about my progress and have been so proud of myself for finally making the investment in moneytimeat first i thought it wa cute how well we got along wed laugh together be weird together she genuinely seemed happy to see methen i thought wow she really care too shed get visibly excited and super happy for me and my progress high fiving me and clapping when i told her about a sport thing i did and then she would do the massage on my neck but then i starting noticing what felt like chemistry but i brushed it off a silly then one day her voice would lowered a she wa focused on finding a spot while masaging me is it there and i couldnt brush it off anymore yeah i think so thats the spot  i said extra loud to sound dumb lol somebody plz tell me if i sound like it all in my headbut i wa still fine until one day i wa asking her something and she wa leaning against the wall and i noticed there wa like this head tilt gaze while crouching towards me it felt like we were at the locker in high school or something and i thought omg i think i def sense something from her here and that weekend i realized i myself have caught feeling by mistake and now im having so much social anxiety that i can barely talk to this person because i know how inappropriate it is and probably illegal and i do not want to have this crush but i somehow do and i dont know what to do nowweve been working together for  month now we have about  more week to go i dont want to start all over with someone else but i dont want to deal with this awkward anxiety each time i go because im trying so hard to surpress it and play it cool if she ha no feeling for me then this is definitely not respectfulfair to her at all and so now i keep my response to her super short and i think im coming off a mean compared to how friendly i use to be and the other day she asked about my weekend i tried to keep it short and then she asked me more about it and i just couldnt talk normally bc of the anxiety to not let it show that i am crushing so i tried to mutter something and i came off so weird ughhh would it be messed up if i ask to be switched to another pt in the same office do i just stop and hope to find a new place i feel so bad but i have to be realistic here and my wellness is my top priority not a crush on someone who i dont even know that well and who for all i know is not into me and just really doing their job so well that i accidentally caught an attractionnow i also find myself thinking of her a lot and i try to stop but it like im developing this

in the uni that i had very strong feeling towards we havent chatted before that point but i have been admiring her for a while ive been always a direct person but also im terrible at making new friend

chance with her she didnt tell me yes or no she said let give it a try wa awesome news for melong story short apparently in her reply she implied that let just be friend  month ago not directly in a very vague way and all this time ive been thinking im in a complicated relationship we used to talk during this time and i really thought the ice is breaking just to be surprised a week ago that she treat me a a friend all this time each message i got from her made me happy for day literally but i knew by chance in the last chat that she meant to be just friend  month ago and shes sorry if that caused me any troublei just feel i lost the entire world the idea of even confessing my feeling from the start wa so hard on me we didnt talk on a daily basis kind of weekly thing but for me someone that talk with almost no one at all this wa immense  month of daydreaming a life with her everyday to only find out this wa literally nothing and i dont think this whole thing even matter for her the flag were obvious from the start that she didnt care about this but i just kept the hope that something might eventually happen and with constant chatting all this while i really thought i wa making progress always been for her always offered help always been available when she want anything the idea of knowing by coincidence that i wa friendzoned is killing me it been a week and i just cant stand looking at myself in the mirror this is a nightmare for me and i really regret the day that i opened up about my feeling worst part for a god damn reason i still believe this just didnt happen

course where you show up each day to learn painkiller treatment     medication that work in the moment but have side effect    social anxiety exercise that you can do in the exact moment or right

went very well a background i m have been at my current job for  year ive put in a lot of good hard work and really had to break out of my shell and push against my sa to get good at my job i can for the first time say confidently that i am good at my job and really like it last year i had a meeting with my bos let call him louie for these purpose where i asked for a raise for the first time in my life i wa nervous and shittimg brick but i did it and eventually got turned down due to company rule i wa then offered a different job instead one that would be an apprenticeship that eventually would get me acredited this wa a huge deal a it opened me up to way more money and opportunity i accepted the job and left the meeting fairly happy in the coming month though he never mentioned it again and hired  different guy to do it with no explanation i hardly ever ran into louie and had been extremely busy and anxious training new worker for about a year straight recently there have been slow down at work ror the first time and my paycheck have been getting smaller and smaller the guy who are doing the job i wa offered have never slowed down and have been getting paid in full this whole time ive avoided bringing any of this up for so long but everything ha been stewing and i felt so disrespected and uncared about yesterday louie called me a i wa driving to get a coffee and i finally got into it i stood up for myself and i  made louie a tough opinionated old school italian guy to answer for not giving me the opportunity i deserved and how he made me feel a a man and worker through his action i got heated and yelled a little and so did he i have never done something like this in my whole life especially without embarrassing myself by angry cry in the end we both came to and understanding and he apologized we got past it and im the new year im going to be training for a new job  year ago i couldnt even look my retail manager in the eye im really proud of myself today tldrgot into a heated argument with my bos where he owned up to his b and gave me the job i deserved advocated for myself for the first time and it felt good,anxiety1381,it so bad my neck and shoulder hurt every time i get home it feel like im walking around in a full body cast and im unable to do or move anything besides my eye ive started wondering if maybe thats the reason i get stared at in public it that im constantly darting my eye around every room i walk into and people take immediate notice to overtly noticable anxious peoplereally hate social anxiety not even i can take this shit seriously and it not hard to understand people who dont get it because it make no sense to worry about the thing we do that make each day an absolute hell,anxiety1382,im a sophomore in college and i hate social interaction the thing is i wasnt always like this it wasnt until about my sophomore year of high school when i started to develop social anxiety im not sure what the cause wa but it ha taken over my life being in college ha only made it worse but this year i started to make some real progress i joined an esports club at my school and have made some friend through there while i may mostly talk to them only online i have seen them in person and spent time with them and this is a huge step for me it the first group of people that i have hung out with in college now that im home for winter break i figured why not try to improve even more my old friend from middlehigh school were having a get together and i wa invited i showed up basically scared shitless which i think is what caused me to drink so much i wa so nervous that i just kept drinking hoping i could drink the feeling away when they started smoking weed i joined them for some stupid reason i didnt even want to i just felt weird just sitting there and saying no this obviously caused me to become seriously crossed and i threw up a bunch and could not leave the toilet i could barely even lift my head to make matter worse a bunch of other people from high school that i wa never friend with started showing up and seeing me in the state that i wa in i could hear them talking about me and laughing and i could

me my head and neck start feeling shaky,anxiety1384,like always talking to me only me in a bored tone snapping at me about weird thing condescendingly talking loudly bc i have trouble hearing or understanding anxietyrelated processing issue maybe idk how to describe it there a particular look and tone she used several time im introverted and socially anxious so i overanalyze a lot and am quiet bc i overthink and i thought maybe she needed space from me but i dont act clingy or text her all the time or demand attention maybe i glance at her a few time if i think shes talking to me or to listen when she is talking to the other friend in our group who she get along with better and is more extroverted she said before she doesnt mind that im quiet and introverted and u am generally the listener of her story and thought but i felt she wa getting tired and bored of me after several month and i expressed it to her she told me it wa nothing like that and tried to act better before she reverted again to seeming bored and tired of me so i tried to distance myself bc i felt maybe we were incompatible and i didnt want to make her feel burdened but now suddenly shes okay and bubbly and seemed sort of worried maybe about me leavingi guess im just confused now she didnt seem to want me around anymore last few month when i wa in the friend group at school and thats okay i dont mind being alone it feel better than how lonely i felt in the group but why is she so worried about me leaving if she seemed to be so tired of me before,anxiety1385,can i ask you guy for advice on how to

to do the same even though i cant afford it they always talk about business their property their mercs and bmws their money and stuff while i just sit quiet in the corner with nothing to talk aboutand me being quiet lead to me being bullied a they know i bring nothing to the table for them so they think they have the right to bully me make fun of me all the time and tell me how ugly i am and all

the back door only me out of all the people in the partynow i know i can go completely crazy when drunk and be a huge liability but i personally think that this wa it kicking me out of the house

mood and tell me she wouldnt have invited me if she didnt want me here but i honestly cant tell if she doe and im not sure if shes a bad person or if i am because im not on medication rn and shes basically subsidising the eintire trip,anxiety1415,i struggle with trying to make myself feel included in any type of group conversation or activity i think this is probably my fault because whenever i am in a group conversation i go quiet and mainly just listen because i feel anxious also being in the center of attention with everyone listening to me make me feel really uncomfortable so the most i would do is make small comment occasionally and i would try to make myself talk more to include myself but i have a hard time speaking up and saying something before someone else doe but then because i dont say much i would just be left out and they wouldnt talk to me a much and i really want to feel included but i cant make myself and it so annoying any advice on what i can do,anxiety1416,title,anxiety1417,got a degree so im not completely stupid but my severe social anxiety always let me down even when i try my best it never good enough i usually accept myself and

understand,anxiety1418,i just feel really empty right now i am not someone who socializes weekly but in the past i did try and saw friend atleast  time a month sometimes more sometimes le now that i

friend to talk to anymore they dont text me unless i text them making new friend is the most hardest thing i have to deal with i just cant open up that easily and i am really awkward if i dont know youi just feel really empty and in need of just one good friend that i am comfortable with you know just that one good person who care i dont feel super sad but just so empty inside i dont feel anything and dont expect anything good to come soonhow do you guy overcome the anxiety and ur comfort zone it feel impossible right now and sorry for the venting,anxiety1419,hi rsocialanxiety ive

living in different apartmentsim living with  other stranger sharing  bathroom and kitchen since september i have not cooked a single meal while here i either buy premade food and heat it in the microwave or go buy food somewhere like mcdonaldsim afraid to go to the kitchen for long period of time because im exposed i barely leave my room only going to the bathroom to take a shower and take a shit because i started the habit of pissing in a water jug to avoid leaving my room this ha made me go long period of time without eating doing fast up to  hour,anxiety1424,ive been slowly improving my anxiety over the last few month but honestly i think my life so far im  year old ha been completely wasted this ha never been what i wanted for myself ive been looking at discord chat for  hour thinking how great it would be if i didnt think  time before typing something and then i never know what to say for people to like me and think im funny thats why i never type anything if i cant write to stranger how can i stand to go into discord room talk and try to make friend and im always afraid that i have minor and then theyll think im creepytalking face to face is literally impossible for me because i always try to look uninteresting and i cant fake a smile i have to face reality im a failure i finished college now i only made one friend at first but he dropped out after  month i always avoided talking to people i couldnt make presentation in front of the class and even when i wa approached by beautiful girl i always ignored it i never had a girlfriend because my biggest fear is being rejected and humiliated because of my jaw and now i dont know what to do because my parent are already  year old and im way behind everyone else my age and younger im going to start working in the next few month and im alone ive never in my life approached a girl to date me moreover i have never approached a girl to be my friend just so you guy can see how long ive been a retardi dont think there hasnt been a day so far that my anxiety hasnt affected my decision so it only natural that in the future it will continue to affect regardless of my effort so i think i lost to anxiety,anxiety1425,for example i may try to interact with stranger but they turn to hug someone elsepose for a photo with someone elseignore me entirely which leaf me in an awkward position where im the annoying one once wa told to get off stage because i wa in the middle of a shootwhat should i do,anxiety1426,or at least made it more manageable,anxiety1427,anxious a hell at family gathering awkward a fuck feeling left out black sheep i cant connect with them no matter how hard i try theyre all super close and conversating and when i come around it awkward when others come around oh heyyy blah blah blah it like lack of respect it like they dont know me and i dont know how to get them to know me anymore  this shit is always how it is and i thought it would be different this year ha,anxiety1428,whats up friendsi believe i can finally say that i have beaten this awful game that we are all forced to play social anxiety social anxiety ha stolen happiness and year of my life from me it ha made me sad borderline suicidal and feel like a complete loser a screw up i did not expect any of this to change ever not until my girlfriend of  year broke up with me my social anxiety had been getting worse and eventually it made her leave the only light in my life however this ended up being the best thing that could have happened to me at rock bottom hating myself more than ever and with no social skill i decided to go to war with my social anxiety i had nothing to lose after alli wanted to fix my social skill so i decided to throw myself into the deep end i got a retail job selling shoe the first day wa awful and i called in sick for the first  week after my first shift i felt again like a massive loser and decided to give it another shot it wa not a bad a my first shift and i continued to show up it wa awful but it got better very slowly with every shift fast forward a year later and people think i am the most social outging and confident man they know insane but truei hated the way i looked i had always been into lifting but i wa also a fat bastard kg m i decided to continue lifting  day a week to walk  minute a day and to cut the weight it took me  month to cut down to kg i looked great even if my body dysmorphia told me otherwise i even felt great i felt healthy strong handsome and confident i even received compliment and people became more touchy it is crazy how important a healthy body is for good mental health besides getting fit i also decided to get obsessed with fashion i felt great i also wanted to look great very few people actually care about fashion so i figured this would be a good way for me to stand out in a positive way it took some courage to wear certain colour or type of clothing rock a cologne and even wearing ring and a bracelet seemed daunting at first but eventually it became my look it became me people love the way i dress and i receive so so many compliment nowlast but not least and this one might seem weird i got into a youtube channel called charisma on command i got obsessed with their content it is like learning how to be human not any human but a human people would love to be around i watched every single fucking video i rewatched every single fucking video again and again and again this channel taught me how to be someone people would love to be around and more importantly it taught me to love myself i cannot recommend this tip enoughi hope this did not sound like bragging because it is not i am finally happy and it would make my year if this post manages to help at least one person plagued by social anxiety one last piece of advice that helped me a ton fake it until you make it fake it fake it fake it and eventually it will feel natural and i know what youre probably thinking it is not that easy i cannot just make these change i know it is not easy but it seems to be the only way for people like u to learn how to enjoy lifewe fear fucking everything but you cannot be brave without fear i beg you to stop existing and to start living thanks for taking the time to read my story even if it did not help you,anxiety1429,no just me theni dont know whether im imagining it or whether it caused by anxiety and overthinking rather than something more serious but lately ive managed to convince myself that i have an actual medical problem that is stopping me from having proper conversation it like i cant think of word fast enough or that even if i can think of them i cant put them together into a grammatically correct sentence fast enough im so convinced that it stopping me from exposing myself to more social situation ill just think im to incompetent to maintain a conversation,anxiety1430,my sister in law is a very private person so only like to share very certain detail about herself she doesnt do chit chat because it boring only talk when there something worth talking about but ha also ha said she hate been asked how she feel about stuffthis just leaf me constantly struggling to talk to her but also completely confused a to whats interesting not being nosy and being worth talking aboutwe have music in common but thats usually a very short lived conversation leaving me scrambling with what to say to her all the time i want to ask her these question im genuinely interested in her because shes a nice person and were related but it been treated a prying before and i dont want to upset her or make her mad at me to make matter worse shell have hushed private conversation with my wife in front of me and get annoyed at me if i overhear anything ive effectively become scared to talk to her because it might upset but also ha me questioning if there is something wrong with me a everyone else in the family talk to her just fineit would be easier to deal with if i could limit the time i spend around her but this isnt feasible either a i live in my inlaws house the house she grew up in she life  house away from ours so she can come round when she plea and often doe to see my wife and kid the fact i cant even ask her to leave or cant be in a space where someone can just walk in and make me feel like this is making me not want to come home after work anymore it sends my sa and feeling of worthlessness into total overdrive a it a constant stream of little failure to confidently interact with people what am i supposed to do cant interact but also cant disengage completely i have tried with just being polite but that make me feel like a failure too it so illogical and frustrating,anxiety1431,basically ive struggled with social anxiety for a long time but it interesting and weird because itll shift form over time i used to go to the gym all the time with little sa but for the past  year my brain been like nope we have

worked i walked in spoke to the person at the front looked around and acquainted myself with the environment and then left feeling proud i took a small stepnow the hard part getting myself to actually go workout lol but at least it not a daunting now because i proved to myself i can do it ,anxiety1432,no one feel permanent i feel like friend could vanish overnight if i dont hear from someone for a longer period of time than usual i feel like theyve left me for good or decided they dont want me around i think having a relationship where i saw them  ha built something unhealthy within my brain where a person need to be around me all the time in order to feel their presence in my life ive currently got  unopened message to friend that i sent today and cant stop checking my phone for when they reply i trying not to be but my brain so desperately want to be needy right now to people i want to hold on to in my life i started worrying that i hadnt heard from someone in a while and snapchat reminded me we only hung out  day ago cant wait for counselling to start in a few month hoooo boy weve got a lot to talk about until then i just need to try my best not to ruin anything,anxiety1433,ha anyone ever felt or feel like they dont fit into any social situation or feel like an alien when it come to social interactionsive been feeling like this for a whole and it

last question i forgot to say some of my skill i wa wanting to highlight too but i wa eloquent with some other question on one hand im proud that i did it on the other hand just like ugh why did i have to mess up on those  question and let my awkward self out in front of the interviewer i feel like my voice is very strained and face frozen when im nervous especially on the phone oh well im just so glad it over and now waiting for the result tagging this a a success because i did it no matter the outcome if i dont get this one then on to the next,anxiety1441,heyi know what you all feel like i wa alone my whole life besides a few friend but i have learned  thing that really helped me instead of being these just be yourself tip find out your personality type it sound stupid but trust me that way you learn thing about yourself and you realise that a you are not alone and b alot of behaviour of yours are due to your personality im intp which mean it part of my personality to have an hard time finding new people not only due to social anxiety get your hormonesvitamins checked espacially a a man get testosterone free test estrogen checked they are known to cause low confidence low motivation and anxiety if not optimal i discovered my t level were far below optimal and im now starting trt google trt social anxiety also vitamin and all important nutriens should be checked make sure all those thing are perfect and check if symptom improve most likley they will by alot also tell your doc to check all these value i needed to ask  time till someone actually checked my t level dont give in first do step  to have the best result slow and simple exposure therapy start doing thing that give you some social anxiety daily be creative you dont have to meet people every day it enough to be around people like going to the mall or going to the gym your brain will adapt it is like a muscle if you do it every day your confidence will eventually grow if you stop your confidence will shrink again and your anxiety grow i also did this when i still had a panic disorder and it helped my recovery alot stay away from drugsalcohol a much a possible but use it to your advantage if there is no other possibility never drink regular regular drinking increase stress and anxiety thats a fact but when you do step  exposure therapy there may be new social situation like a party were it could be good to use the alcohol to get over your fear of going there for example the first time i did this my sober mind wa not able to even think of going there then i drank  beer before and suddenly it felt easier now i am at the point were i dont need anything before and can also talk with people without alcoholthese are my  most important thing regarding social anxiety  avoidance personality disorder  living a an introvert hope it help anyone and let me tell you guy that change is possible at any time during your life even after  year of living with it there is hope for

outside of the car on big store and walking up to the door for small store still cant bring myself to go inside but hey baby step,anxiety1450,just a little background on me before i start my social skill are not great and i dont actively have friend because i abandoned them a few year ago due to some realization about myself that i had when i wa having a rough time at this point i am too afraid to have friend again because of social anxiety the fact that i dont know how to maintain friendship and that ill probably just abandon them anyways among other reason also i dont even know if i actually enjoy being around people especially group of peoplei am however more content than ever with being alone than ever and doing thing alone like traveling i dont leave the house much and barely interact with people outside of my family at least until i start my job in january i do however get a lot of satisfaction from one off interaction i have especially while traveling i prefer this because committing to people is scary and i dont have to deal with the anxiety of trying figuring out how to maintain a friendship or the pain when i inevitably canteven though i say all this sometimes a feel like i want to dip into having friend again and talking to people but i always pull back after one interaction because of my inexperience and anxietynow to some recent interaction that are really affecting meinteraction last week i wa on a cruise with my family early in the cruise i met this girl at the pool and we talked a little bit and bonded a little because we were some of the youngest people on the cruise i didnt feel like i completely made a fool of myself or screwed up the interaction too much so i felt okay about it from that perspectivei didnt see her much of the rest of the cruise because we were usually on different schedule but i just waved and said hi whenever i did see her this wa the first thing that really affected me when we were first talking she mentioned that she wa disappointed that there werent more people our age on the cruise to interact with given that i didnt completely screw up the first interaction i kept feeling like i should go and say hi and ask her if they wanted to hang out or play a game with me or my sister and i the main dilemma here is that i am way more socially incompetent when my family are around so i knew that would never work out and i would be too embarrassed to say i wa going to hang out with someonebesides one other brief interaction nothing else happened the rest of the cruise and it wa affecting me because i felt like i should have done something even though i knew it would not work out i wa just really hoping i could have one last interaction to resolve this tension i felt lo and behold our first flight home were the same i had weird interaction on the ship because my family wa around and i cant behave normal around them but at the airport while we were waiting to board we talked for a while and it gave me some closure and i felt good about the fact that i talked to someone and didnt screw up too bad even with this closure i still felt like i wanted give her my contact info so we could stay in contact and just see how thing go but i didnt do this because i wa too embarrassed to do it in front of my parentslater on the flight when i wa on my way back to my seat from the bathroom i passed by her row and she stopped me and asked for my instagram i told her i didnt have any social medium and that i deleted it year ago i offered to give her my phone number instead but she didnt want it we live in different country and were traveling abroad so i think she wa worried about international texting charge at least thats the most basic explanation i can think of but i totally understand if not having social medium wa a red flag for her or made her uncomfortable after that i just said sorry and went back to my seat and we never interacted after thatwhen i went back to my seat i felt really good about myself because i stuck to my choice to avoid social medium and wa not going to let anyone make me feel like i needed to use it to be normal i deleted all my social medium year ago because it wa having a negative affect on me and i am still very pleased about that decision i would be so fake of me to make a social medium account just so i can talk with some person i met while travelingat that point i decided that i would give her a piece of paper with my number on it and she could decide whether she wanted to contact me or not and i could just leave it there i make decision in the moment without thinking all the time and then rethink them immediately afterwards so i though that would give her another chance to choose whether she wanted to stay in touch or not they were in a rush to get to their connection after the first flight so i never go to do that it wa so weird because i wa just feeling really good about myself for sticking to gut but then i felt bad because i lost a potential friend which i supposedly dont even want in the first placei had a really long layover after that so i spent a while trying find her up online which in retrospect is creepy af but i didnt find anything i knew that even if i got her contact info we would text for a week or two and then probably never text again because i dont know how to maintain relationship but it still feel like a missed opportunity to make a friend but wait i dont want friend so wa it just because she is the opposite genderi would like to think that i dont treat people differently because of their gender and that i am absolutely content with not having any relationship but maybe im subconsciously seeking that out im disappointed in that behaviorinteraction a couple of week ago i wa on a cross country train on the last day i met this guy in the observation car after i sat down next to him it started with just some small comment about the scenery and it turned into a really nice conversation that basically lasted until the afternoon when we got to our destinationfor some reason it wa really easy to talk with him i assume thats probably because we talked a lot about thing i like train and travel which is much easier for me and didnt feel like i wa preventing him from doing anything else since the best thing to do wa just sit back and enjoy the amazing scenery i shared some of my snack with him and generally got way more comfortable talking with him and i didnt feel awkward at allat the end of the day when we were close to our destination he gave me his business card and said i could contact him if i wanted to hang out while i wa in town the next day thing didnt go a planned and i got done with everything on my list faster than i thought so i easily could have contacted him but a always i have so much anxiety about committing to thing with other people this is especially true when im traveling solo because im trying to make them most of my time and waiting around on other people and not having clear expectation of what is going to happen doesnt sit well with mei feel kinda bad because he seemed like a cool person and i could have made a friend and it would have been great because we both had some thing in common i still have his contact info but i havent done anything with it this is just another example of how i dont know how to do friendshipsconclusioni dont know why i interact with people because im too afraid to make friend and then i let the interaction affect me way too much even if they went okay also my social and friendship skill are absolutely not good enough so i know either the relationship will fail because of that or because i sabotage them because rejection feel comfortable and like what i deserve and i have a fear of being acceptedi also wonder if i need to use social medium again in order to move forward with my life im very against going back to it and i dont think i could use it productively even though some people can i even avoid linkedin which i feel basically ha the same premise of trying to show other people how perfect your are just like other social medium i do however know that the main benefit of social medium is that you can stay in contact with ton of people and see what they are doing without having to expend the effort of actually staying in touch with them also some people may feel like it is a red flag if you dont use social medium which i understanding thats probably why that girl didnt want to take my numberthanks for reading i would love to hear if other people experience similar thing or what you thing of my experience,anxiety1451,but i am too nervous my social anxiety level is too high and my job is at clothing store i dont know what to do at the job i hope they wont bully me i am even thinking about not going right now,anxiety1452,i dont wanna give value to anyone i wanna keep it balanced i dont wanna come off a a desperate person i show too much interest everytime and i regret alot later on i have so many unnecessary thought on my mind which are completely useless and are damaging me from the inside i hate this what is wrong with me man i feel like cry ,anxiety1453,almost completely monotone and show no enthusiasm or expression i feel like a zombie walking between the living im dismissive and only talk to certain people but have no real connection with anyone i think i used to be really connected with my cousin we were friend now it just like i dont want to talk to him much anymore after i had felt like what wa my own death ive become almost completely indifferent i can make eye contact go here go there but ill always have to announce how much i dont want to be here or there i used to stress about being positive around others and talking more whenever i feel intense anxiety ill stick through it real cold like only to express bordem and disinterest or ill just escape again im getting the fuck out of here dont fkn talk to me ive gone through some sort of burnout this past year and im more isolated than ever before i have family to see but nowhere where id ever feel truly connected with anyone although i always gotta ask myself if i even want to or do i even know how either way it very lonely living in my world rn i definitely need month or yr of time by myself i enjoy being alone i still need more hobby and probably more of an education sometimes i think no company is better than bad company but become depressed when i dont do anything on my day off or anything very valuable some people would assume their success by having people they consider friend that dont even have the slightest of interest for their best interest anyway thats where i wish i had some sort of like minded motivator not in a needy way but someone that at least life life in a similar fashion i dont think im in desperation i dont think ill make friend or really desire to certainly not with the people i come across right now,anxiety1454,we have our christmas celebration at college tomorrow and i cannot function right now i have an exam right before that and i cannot concentrate one bit everyone is so excited about the dj party and everything and i am freaking out over the whole thing i know it is silly but i am panicking over what i wear and how i will look stupid just standing there while everyone will be enjoying the dj night i cannot just not go because my friend and my parent want me to and i am in a difficult postion to back out,anxiety1456,because im doing a pretty demanding degree im on campus every day of the week all day im always by myself i havent made any friend in the  year that ive been here even though i see the same people and friend group regularly worse i very rarely even speak to anyone my normal routine involves sitting alone during lecture and break then going back home constantly feeling lonely is bad enough but the anxiety selfconsciousness and low selfesteem that go along with it is making me utterly miserable sometimes i feel so selfconscious when sitting alone during a lecture that itll be difficult to concentrate on the actual lecture ill feel like im being judged a the weird quiet guy who doesnt speak to anyone and ill feel terrible about myself when i see other people sitting with friend and generally having a nice time it make me feel different weird incompetent etc i also feel like im missing out i wa genuinely looking forward to fixing my social life before i started uni it wa such a big opportunity for me to overcome my anxiety and poor social skill but in the  year that ive been here i havent been out a single time alone or with anyone else it just completely shit the fact that i live an hour drive away from campus make thing even worse i know im whining like a bitch at this point but im starting to lose all hope last year i would regularly read book by psychologist on overcoming social anxiety and i wa so determined to fix thing none of it worked,anxiety1457,when i moved to my parent home state in  i thought i had found the perfect balance between family and space but right now i just feel alone the one time my family ha had to be together every year is christmas this year due to a number of shortsighted decision im only going to be seeing my brother im grateful for that but some part of me is devastated to be spending my first christmas away from my mother and sister whats worse is that i recently caught covid and the five day of quarantine made me realize how easily i can be isolated even more close to home if it wasnt for work ill id have only a few finicky relative and acquaintance to rely on i suppose getting a car would probably help expand my horizon if nothing else but even then id still be just a socially distant a ever i feel so little confidence in my ability to form any sort of meaningful connection with others,anxiety1458,when i look in my mirror i think how disgusting and ugly i am  sometimes i just wish to rip my face off so i dont have to see it anymore when im at school i think everyone see how ugly am i  they all take glance  at me solid  second  some smile some just dont  some people say im handsome  but it easy to take pitty on someone isnt it at this point im just wondering if someone is at the same point a me sorry for bad english,anxiety1459,looking for job rn a a  yr old and im dreading it but im just gonna put up with it when i wa  i had a job at this pizza place and i only went like  shift because i wa so anxious and i cried every night about my job i had nightmare and stuff about the job i just had to quit or i wa gonna mentally die this aged care home i applied to emailed me for an interview and ive also applied to  other job but im so nervous that im gonna quit

had the pleasure of being confronted for the way i talk i know that i havent always been this anxious when it come to socializing period but somehow or another i have completely lost my mind using the word um uh when you are talking is a habit so i have been told and not a good one i also have started to stutter real bad when answering question maybe because i am unsure i am answering the correct answer im not sure but some advice would help because honestly i had no idea i wa going downhill,anxiety1461,so i have been wondering about this for some time now to give some background information i have had period in which i had high social anxiety i wa the kid in the class that would turn red every time a teacher asked a question or that wa shaking during presentation or refusing to do them additionally i wa always too afraid to ask girl on date talk to stranger or put myself in front of a large group however i have been wondering whether those symptom were not merely a result of low selfesteem i have had period in which i wa on an alltime low not taking care of myself not following my own interest and having few meaningful contact however in the past year i have made change to my life i began incorporating a normal sleeping schedule working out especially running and weight training a couple of time per week eating cleaner cutting down on caffeine and doing thing i wanted to do and it seems that my social anxiety decreased a lot to maybe even normal level of course i still get anxious when doing public speaking or sometimes in meeting and try to avoid karaoke but it seems that my anxiety ha settledampxbi am not saying that this is the solution because my knowledge of the topic is very minimal i wa just wondering what others would think of this especially since my therapist is also not convinced with my theory,anxiety1462,honestly what i usually do is just sit at my office directly and saying hi to each one individually when i encounter them but it doe make me awkward a no one doe this except me lolbut having to go to each one and shake their hand and talk to them and hug some of them is very tough for me but this what others usually do,anxiety1463,i went to the optician to try on glass and my mother accompanied me the optician looked at my ear to adjust the glass based on them after she left with my glass my mother wishpered to me you already

able to do thing i wasnt comfortable with but i still feel bad about every social interaction and i keep thinking that my social anxiety would have saved me from embarrassing myself or stopped me from being weird the thing is i have no idea how normal people act idk if what im doing is right or wrong i still feel incredibly uncomfortable in my own body and everything i do feel dumb and annoying i never know what im supposed to do ever,anxiety1465,im currently working a temp job giftwrapping for christmas and received a customer complaint which said i did not treat her a a customeri helped

personal life im completely quiet and introverted againrecently i left work where i wa firing on all cylinder drove  minute to my daughter nativity and basically couldnt talk to any of the other parent despite literally having just given a tour around the business to  potential new customer i sort of assumed id have grown out of this by now ,anxiety1474,so it seems whenever i go to any party house restaurant dinner whatever i always have a headache at the end of them and sometimes i become really faint or low blood pressure a well and my best guess is that it a combination of the noise of everyone chatting away and also trying my best to focus on people and what they are saying but then i realise they arent talking to me anyway but i sit there and assume that i should be there and available to chat to the people in my vicinity then after some time i realise im probably the most boring person there personality wise lol even after drinking and it always the same outcome,anxiety1475,a lot of people seem to talk about how when it come to being in a conversation they never know what to say they never know what to say next or they feel like they just dont have anything to contribute i used to kind of blindly think that i related to this but i starting thinking about it more and i realized that it actually the opposite for me i always know what i can say next there always a sentence or reaction that come up naturally for me in my head what stop me from being a part of a conversation though is that i am always afraid that im breaking some unspoken social rule that i might not know about in the past i wa actually very talkitive but also kind of a weird kid i still had friend growing up but i always noticed in elementary school that people didnt always react positively to the thing i did or said a i got older i guess i subconsciously learned that the le i say and the more of my personality i hide the more neutral people would be with me i wouldnt be making a many friend but at least i wasnt going to get ostracized by my peer anymore i have so much i want to say all the time but im so deep in my fear at this point i dont know when it will ever feel safe for me to be myself around people last year i tried making friend with a group of people and the more i opened up i feel like the more they got le interested in me even with my family i feel like im hiding myself sometimes everyone always say just open up but what if im already trying that and it just go wrong when i do the negative side of me tell me that maybe im just extremely unlikable like i naturally just repell people somehow and it something everyone else can see but i cant how do people just know what is ok to say and what is not how are they so confident in knowing that what they say will land literally everything that come out of my mouth is carefully selected to be the most neutral response i can come up with something that ive learned work but it not enough to show my personality or connect with people and it just so hard when being yourself is recieved so negatively all the time i think thats part of the reason i have such low self esteem it just feel like people never end up liking me when im being myself it really discouraging to feel like youre finally doing well with socializing only to find out that people dont like you at your best,anxiety1476,hii seem to struggle in social situation i tend to panic and that seems to lead to oversharing or discussing topic that are not suitable for the particular group it lead to very poor situation in which i discus personal financial plan negative thought that dont pertain to a conversation and many other discussion that i myself dont understand why i initiate what can i dothanks,anxiety1477,it doesnt matter how nice and upbeat i try to be probably half the people i meet find my behavior weird off putting or rude i work in a pharmacy going to quit soon and i have soo many customer perceive my behavior a rude i wa nothing but nice and polite to this girl and i saw her mouthing what the fuck under her breath and making an annoyed face when i turned away from her she rolled her eye when i told her to have a nice day it to weird because she wa nice when she initially approached so my behavior and demeanor wa offputting some customer call me sweet and are super nice to me but many others develop an attitude and get defensive while talking to me one girl took her stuff and left my line after all i did wa greet her ask her her name and tell her thank you lol i recorded my voice and it sound really flat low monotone so i think this is why i sound rude combined with the fact i cant make small talk im quiet and i give one word reply to customer when i try to make my voice higher pitched this actually backfire and i sound fake and really bitchy when i say thank you it always sound so sarcastic and condescending i tried to compliment this guy item by saying it wa cute and where did he find it and he grabbed it from me and gave an offended look and he thought i wa mocking him or making fun of him i also have mean looking harsh eye and i think this make me look unkind it just strange how certain people find me really sweet and quiet and kind but  percent of other people think im a rude bitch,anxiety1478,im  and ha sa for mostly in my life growing up  im  and never had a serious relationship and obviously never lost my v card  im thinking of going to an escort to loose my card  is this normal or anyone here did it  also my only worry is that i dont

growing up and i am finally starting to feel a little bit better in social situation thanks to lot of practice but i still have this core belief that when i meet people they dont like me and it make it hard for me to form friendship with people because i am scared theyll find out im not a cool a they first thought my friend and husband tell me that i am likeable but i cant believe it about myself for some reason doe anyone else struggle with this and ha anyone found a way to overcome it ive done therapy which helped a little but still cant shake the thought distortion,anxiety1481,it like am so not everyone will see it right awayim trying to see it a some kind of experiment to see who would be kind to me instead of a real interactioni told them i cant come today because i feel really sick so someone else need to bring the cooky if they want some god i hope it wont get too awkward,anxiety1482,i guess this is a little vent im so frustrated basically ive been working in a group with  others for the past month on a project in my college english class we each had six powerpoint slide to present and the slide had only a line or two of information so we had to add on with our own input a well a explaining the graph and image i wa doing so well all throughout making eye contact with a loud speaking voice and adding good information even on the last slide but then at the final bullet point i wa to cover i ended up losing what i wa saying and just froze i kept saying and over and over until i started to cry and thats when one of my partner came in and finished my thought for me it wa and still is so embarrassing for me because not only did i cry in front of the entire class but also my history teacher and a few other teacher i had in the past it also incredibly annoying because it wa the last thing i had to say before i wa finished plus it wa my favorite slide that i had made to cover and i rehearsed what i wa going to say in my head over a dozen time i feel like im always going to be known a the kid who couldnt finish their presentation because they cried especially because my school is really small i feel like i let my team down,anxiety1483,im  with bad social anxiety i dont vape daily and ive never even vaped ive just tried it  if u know what i mean there a difference between once trying it or repeatedly inhaling it  okay so last weekend i wa at a party where we shared a vape and i found that when i wa vaping it i seemed more social and relaxed and i could strike up a convo with someone ofc there wa alcohol but i wa sobered up already so im pretty sure it the vape that made me relaxed i also didnt stutter that much my social anxiety is pretty bad in school and it making daily life hard for me so i wa thinking maybe i should try out vaping for my sawhat do you think is it worth it,anxiety1484,i recently moved and only have my bf here im really lonely and want to make friend but i dont know how in a new place and im too scared

want to share it with friend if it not even them if anyones curious i wa bored waiting for my train and thought it would be cool if i had a meet cute rn and then i proceeded to run into this guy i went on a date with,anxiety1486,for everyone here who struggle with social anxiety there is hope im a f who ha never known a life without social anxiety ive ruined countless friendship isolated myself refused phone call missed out on so many opportunity and at one point could barely leave the house this year i backpacked across europe  solo and can finally say social anxiety no longer control my life i am confident in conversation i made friend from all over the world i hold a full time job answer phone call and dont miss out on opportunity out of fear anymore this isnt what anyone with sa want to hear but sincerely the only way i have overcome this god awful illness is by doing every single thing that terrified me  sitting in a coffee shop alone going to the mall alone striking conversation with cashier complimenting people on the street saying yes to plan facing social anxiety head on is the hardest thing i have ever had to do i still struggle with it and i think i might always but now i dont let it stop me i just want to say there is hope you are worthy of love you are not a awkward a you think everyone is focused too much on themselves to focus on you and you are more than your social anxiety lt,anxiety1487,over the weekend i stayed at my boyfriend house to celebrate the holiday with him and his family for most of the weekend it went great but there would be

try to fight those urge and intrusive thought while trying to focus at work and they wont stop when im alone idk if social anxiety ha to do with it i cant distract myself from these thought i cant do anything i cant fulfill my sexual desire cause first of all im gay closeted and ashamed and too socially anxious and scared to find a partner i hate the idea of casual sex so thats a big no i feel so trapped and doomed i just come home after work and lock myself in my room and start cry and try to unwind with the raunchiest and nastiest kind of porn and after that a social medium marathon it like

technique but i cant stop the loud noise i feel hopeless and suicidal,anxiety1495, i am in my early s went out with my parent their treat for some drink and a meal to celebrate my birthday we did not tell the waiter or the place that it wa my birthday so no one knew but my parent our waiter wa a pretty jacked guy like low body fat muscular clearly go to the gym  to  time a week consistently i say this for a reason it stood out compared to everyone else there and i wonder in hindsight if it mattered once i give more infoso the waiter wa polite and we had some drink i wa all smile and please and thank yous after every thing he did no waiter certainly could complain after a drink or two i got up to goto the toilet and my mom said the waiter like looked at me in shock or admiration a i walked off because she thought he wa a pretty big muscular guy but then when i got up  ft  also big muscular granted could lose  pound after last few month i am probably lb but my mom said i looked really big next to him in comparison anyway based on where we were sitting i noticed the waiter come by each time a he wa always in our direct view maybe i wa staring or looking too much and that may play into the next bit not been out in a while for various reason but once i wa back at the table shortly after that i glanced and saw him looking at me and laughing and could see he mumbled something to his colleague ive always been good at reading people from a far so i wa like huh is his colleague about to look at me too and laugh and the fellow waiter turned  and looked at me and laughed and i pretended not to see out of the corner of my eyei noticed numerous time he looked at me after that and said somethings to fellow waiterwaitresses and they looked at me infact literally every waiterwaitress he said something to them and they looked at me and giggled or laugh made me feel really self conscious after being so polite to him especially when i wa told hey let take bday picture after i just finished a big meal and just repeatedly saw the waiterwaitresses laughing at me and i went from feeling good about myself on my bday to feeling like something wrong with me and my mood and self esteem plummeted the next time i looked i glanced and felt like our waiter wa saying something to them about me i glanced back again and then saw  of the waitress and  other waiter he wa saying something to pop their head round the corner look at me and laugh this is a really high quality pretty expensive place we are at so all the staff a bit more quality so it kinda stung i mean i wa dressed normally infact thought i looked pretty damn good until i see the staff laughing at me saw some lady at the other table granted they were quite bit older than me seemingly eyeing me up numerous time which made me think i cant look that bad or stupid considering they were seemingly checking me out and smiling a few time at me but by then my confidence wa dinged since im trying to enjoy my birthday and i keep catching staff staring at me and like chuckling i dont eat with my mouth open ever or slap and i make sure i always wipe any mess off face after eating messy food immediatelyperhaps i wa just overthinking thing but they definitely like all looked at me at numerous point and all laughed the worst wa when  of the staff like looked at me back to back giggling about whatever when i left the couple female waitress did sorta check me out but perhaps they were just thinking what an idiot although i am not sure why at that point i couldnt tell youi guess i would just say be kind people try not to judge too harshly i wa just going out first time in a while after hard work and struggling with some stuff and i felt like i wa being laughed at on my birthday when before that i thought i looked pretty good left totally confused and wishing i could have legit just heard exactly what they said about me so i could correct it and instead now i just feel like it something i cant control i really just wish i could know what the damn issue wa like i wa in fresh clothes super polite and friendly just trying to eat and drink on my bday after not having the ability to do so in a few month hmmf,anxiety1496,ive struggled with this for over a decade  everytime i muster the courage or peer pressured into attending a social event it is a catastrophe  ive never tried medication but i feel it is time  it is affecting my job im the cliche it guy  all i feel is emptynumb when im around people  im the type to only speak when spoken to so i can go week without speaking ive lost the reason to communicate  small talk just feel pointless to me  watching people make  minute joyful conversation about cheese or being vegetarian and im sitting there solely out of  people dead inside body numb to not feel anxiety but i bring zero value to this gathering it really pain me that i have to experience this at work i could of liked this job  your peer pressured into doing activity for company culture  surrounded by extrovert and you have no life experience  what do i do nextmedication ive never tried it  if it take the anxiety away when i stop the medication doe is returnis there any service i can use to improve small talk  even though im dead inside i at least want to be able to fake like i care and can have joyous conversation on cheese or

sensitive and have awful social anxiety,anxiety1500,a little over a week ago i attended a large biyearly social event the first day i wa invited to an activity room i really enjoyed the following day i brought a couple friend to the room but the vibe wa a lot le inviting and carefree than last time the people were different too it a large scale group activity so everyone wa chatting and waiting around for it to begin suddenly someone who seemed like they may be coleading the event yelled at me and the room went silent everyone stared at me i wa confused but i apologized  i dont know what for my cheek immediately turned pink and i had trouble breathing total panic mode i wa scolded then the person continued what they were doing but the rest of the room stayed silent it felt so embarrassing im nearly  year old but i wa just scolded like a disrespectful child when the activity began there were immediately some problem it wa possible that some people participating were not participating correctly but due to the nature of the activity no one could know who until the people responsible were voted out voting people out is a part of the activity everyone accused me and the people i wa with of sabotaging the activity some accusation were quiet comment under breath some were literal motion to make u leave someone accused me of shit talking the coleader who had yelled at me earlier it wa a confusing mess and i really didnt understand of course all of u were voted out of the activity immediately and the actual leader announced we were officially not at fault for the sabotage but it didnt matter by that point the social damage wa done and frankly no one seemed to care whether we were actually at fault or notit wasnt until later that night one of my friend explained that the coleader had been annoyed at my presence from the beginning and had thought that i wa mocking him and telling my friend next to me that i thought he should just stop talking this wa relayed to everyone in the room when i wa scolded but since id been talking to my friend about getting our eyebrow threaded i had no idea obviously it wa all a complete misunderstanding even during the activity my friend who id been talking to asked me quietly do thing seem really intense to you whats going on he also had no idea everyone in the room had turned on u it been over a week and i cant stop mentally going back to that room kicking myself for all the thing i could have said to somehow clear up what happened or stand up for myself im hurt that people would make such harsh and untrue judgement about me i feel dumb and foolish for not knowing what wa going on when it wa happening mostly i feel so so so sad after the first time i went to that room i thought this could be a fantastic place to make friend ive been really lonely since the pandemic and when i got invited into that room i felt so much hope and opportunity now i feel like it ruined but worst of all every moment im not distracted im replaying thing people had said during the activity thing i didnt understand at the time but make sense in hindsight and im hurt all over again how do i forgive them and myself how do i stop thinking about this my social anxiety is so much worse this week than it been all year i felt like i wa making so much progress and now i feel like i regressed just from this one incident i need comfort and id appreciate advice overthinking isnt something i usually do,anxiety1501,a the title suggests i really want to play dampd but the roleplay element brings a lot of

know how to say no to and let them take advantage of me because of me being a people pleaser i guess eventually this person actually believed or they were still trying to take advantage of me in a way and wanted to keep in contact i tried giving hint that i couldnt keep in touch a much a they wanted to and i eventually ended up blocking their number even though they were a piece of shit person took advantage of me mocked me humiliated me etc i still feel bad for ghosting them i guess half of it is that i feel ashamed for not having the gut to just tell them off like a normal person and half of it is that the way i went about it is not the right thing to do and i feel bad for people despite their action towards meits been about two year now and while it gotten better i still feel bad about it from time to time just wanted to vent a bit,anxiety1505,i have trauma from my biological family so i always avoid people even subconsciously because i think they wont be able to hurt me social

think i dont like themit come off a rude and of course theyll ostracize me and be rude back and if they see me for what i am scared i look vulnerable and they bully harderit seems like such a simple

bought our ticket but her a there been a bit of a problemthis attraction only sell year pass  they are reasonably priced and the price is not a problem for her but the fact that it is a year long pas ha made her quite anxious she would be happy to pay the same amount for just a day pas but a this isnt somewhere she would want to visit again in the next year it seems to be making her feel pressured to go again i have tried to comfort her by mentioning that i also probably wont return within a year but she doesnt like the idea of wasting the year pas and a such is holding off purchasingshe ha been looking forward to this despite being quite worried about it and this is the last step i know it isnt that she doesnt want to come a she initially planned to just show up and buy a day pas but

explaining very impatiently that lunch wa at a different time which made me feel bad because i simply just didnt know so i dont understand her attitude the fact that the classroom went quiet made it worse i dont know why but i felt tear forming it literally wasnt a big deal at all but i had to hold myself back from cry i wa trying to keep myself together but then one of my classmate asked why i look like im about to cry that did it for me and i started cry a lot which made me feel even more embarrassed i dont know i definitely feel like im overreacting but i still feel extremely embarrassed

i told them thats a bad idea cuz theyll be quiet for  day but then will tease me even morea few week ago i got sick and couldnt come to school for a few daysi think those teacher told my class about

various craft and no matter how i try to get involved it like people always see me a an outsider instead of a member of the group im not sure why this isi it just too soon and they havent gotten to know me well enough yet is it my body language am i acting too withdrawn without realizing it acting too outgoing and annoying without realizing it am i imagining itive had some nice conversation with people but im always left with the feeling of not being accepted it doesnt help that no one ever seems to remember my name even after a long chatim rambling but it feel like the whole social integration thing is one big language that everyone else understands and i dont it a struggle to go through interacting with others let alone stay aware of all the little cue and unspoken communication every time i try it feel like failure and im not sure what success would even look like,anxiety1513,i wa hanging out with my friend who also ha a lot of sa and we were talking about

just overthinking so many horrible scenario,anxiety1516,im always in denial i have social anxiety i know i have it but i avoid googling about it for year because i genuinely believe it can be magically cured a i age which is wrongreading about people experiencing the same thing i do are eye opening iam not alone iam not the only one experiencing this thing i never know like brain fog that i always experience but never know what it is to overthinking small thing to feeling insecurei hope someday we can socialise properly but we are too are people we are not some sort of alien we arent

louder,anxiety1518,and it is called laughter yoga yes im perfectly serious but before dismissing this please know that this is backed up by science a well a many people experience a well a my own i did practice it for a few hour whenever i could remember for the past few day and id say that my anxiety in social setting wa decreased by probably  at least ive tried many many method before and im someone who like trying out far out stuff but nothing had such a quick and powerful impact on my mood and openness to others whilst also being quite easy i also found myself laughing genuinely with others which wa so rare before that i had forgotten how it felt even though there are many playful method the gist of it is simply to laugh and laugh even if it fake at first science show that the brain think youre actually laughing and therefore release dopamine endorphin serotonin and decrease cortisol the anxiety marker if youve already tried everything please try it if you havent please give it a go too and let u know about your experience a good place to start would be to watch video by the indian doctor who created this approach like this one you need to do it at the same time

do alright when it come to workrelated or professionrelated talk so my social anxiety doesnt prevent me from functioning in my daily life but it almost comical how others even in the workspace can transition to social conversation effortlessly whereas when i try to contribute to social conversation in work i can visibly see the look of wtf is he on about overcome the other people facesso i spend a lot of time in online community instead like here on reddit or discord lurking for the most part but joining comment too fairly often but there are time when i really get passionate about something and end up posting more indepth than i usually would and at this point i should know by now that im just gonna get a torrent of backlash just that big blasting reminder that others just dont ever seem to think the way i do so disheartening at time just wondering if im not the only one who go through this,anxiety1534,im making it a point to keep widening my comfort zone and to frequently practice socializing ive been going out to place where i can meet people  time per week for the last month and im starting to feel more comfortable so i want to keep that going and transform myself

everything and everywhere i dont want to live like this further i want to get better but will this every end and can we even get normaldo this get better do anyone know anyone who got better i am losing hope,anxiety1539,i have noticed that im not interested on people and on knowing them im happy when i encounter someone i trust but for example i work at a shop and honestly im not interested in knowing people asking them how they are or being friendly with them i just dont want to interact with them and when i do i feel im just being so fake and i feel drained i sometimes feel that maybe im a bad person because of that or that maybe im considered cold or weird and one part of me would like to change is it normal to be this way,anxiety1540,im so terrified i dont know if i can do it theyre only open for one more hour so i need to do it in this time frame unless i want to wait another day i know waiting doesnt help and usually i just impulsively dial the number eventually while i am still a terrified because there no way i can calm down enough to call them after calling myself down but i am so scared i envy everyone that can just take phone call so much i know it stupid to be this scared i hate that this kind of stuff freak me out so much when i am capable of staying logical and calm at everything else except for these social interaction,anxiety1541,hi when i talking to people that i am not fully comfortable with yet i develop the this sensation of my lip shaking and firming up when i am speaking to someone else even if i am just having a basic superficial conversation my lip will tense up and shake it is even worse if i have to be confrontational or speak in front of a group of people i notice that if i am cognizant that my lip might tense up when talking to people i may be able to control it or it becomes worse do any of you experience this,anxiety1542,so ive been applying to job and getting either rejected or no word back my main concern is that i had anxiety to learn to drive so i cant and i dont even have money for a car anyways i feel stuck bc either i have to uber to a job thats  min car ride or apply to something thats a  min walk away ive applied to stuff thats  min mainly bc using an uber would get expensive and im already limited bc some job i would love require me to drive combined with the fact that a a woman im nervous to even take an uber ive never used the service and i keep worrying about just getting into a car with someone i dont know in front of my house bc im too nervous to fake going to a neighbor house and having to deal with potentially some guy asking me personal thing i dont want to answer i feel like id be stressed just going to work hoping someone can even take me there i guess the good thing is i have a family member who could take me but i know they can get busy but thats when im gonna have to take an uber i swear i really just am willing to walk the  min to some job avoid using the service entirely both bc the fear and the cost,anxiety1543,my social anxiety wa telling me not to go public on reddit with thisdont tell anyone because it embarassing you dont want people to look down on you dont show everyone that youre a rejectbut im ignoring that voice and sharing because i have nothing to be ashamed about not everybody is going to be on the same page a me and thats not my fault i dont want to treat it like some sort of secret shame when i shouldnt be ashamedbeing rejected ha no value on my selfworth because if someone i loved wa rejected i wouldnt look down on them any le why look down on myself not everybody gel well with everybody and i will focus on the people who do gel well with me so yeah i wa rejected from a group and thats okay,anxiety1544,i have a wedding i need

i have not spoken to him since though and have not been invited so i dont know what to thinkits not even that i mind being alone new year eve it more a matter of everyone asking what i did new year eve and when i say i wa home alone they will all just think im some weirdo loner and my parent will feel bad for me which i cba listening to it like there is some social norm that you have to be at a party new year eve and if you are not you are just a lonely loseri wa also alone last new year eve and didnt mind it only bad thing is that my mother will get sad on my behalfbut then again maybe i will get invited to my old friend party but i would think that if he wanted me there he would have invited me by now and im not about to text him and ask if i can come i dont want to be the guy that

month ago when we met and im  sure there are feeling there on his side a well problem is im  f never been in a relationship and dont even have any experience with male friend im more anxious around guy in general and whenever i tried dating gave up on that year ago i would pretty much have a full blown panic attack preceding and during the date not sure if this is a good thing or a bad thing but he is of a similar age to me and ha also never been in a relationship though a i understand it he ha quite a few female friend im really pretty embarrassed about how uncomfortable i am around guy i know i might have another panic attack when i see this guy again and im terrified my anxiety gonna make him uncomfortable and unwilling to take thing any further with me im so anxious about this and i really dont know what to do i consider myself a reasonably confident person considering my sa but with dating it just go down the gurgler id love to know people experience with their first

i think ppl heard me my conversation are pretty normal but it happens when i share info about me,anxiety1564,but it wa a no didnt even get a first date before getting rejected  it wa really hard to bring myself to ask i wa so nervous but i spent a lot of time working up the courage until i did it  i figured there wa a possibility she might say no shes been single for  year since her boyfriend died and i assumed her being single wa by choice  ive been chatting with her on and off the last  month the day i thought i would be a good time to finally ask her out we were chatting back and forth and then i ask her and then shes just gone she ghosted me for  hour i could see she had been in chat many time but no reply  i wa dumbfounded a i thought shed care enough for me to politely decline that  hour i wa driving myself crazy wondering if shed ever talk to me again and wa she laughing at me behind my back with her friend  ive been single close to one year now after a  year marriage failed i feel im ready to date after i worked on myself all year but im really socially awkward and have a lot of social anxiety  when she finally wrote back after  hour she just let me down gently with saying she wa busy but that sometime we could get a group of friend to go hang out i humored her and said that sound good  im  sure that group gettogether isnt happening and wa just to nicely say no if somehow it wa happening i probably wouldnt go anyway since im really embarrassed about asking her out and getting turned downi think i have a lot to offer someone in a relationship and could make someone very happy but i think people wont overlook my shyness and give me time to get out of my shell to give me a chance,anxiety1565,i cannot really understand why im afraid of talking to people specially those who are close to my family one thing i absolutely despise is small talk one thing is disliking it another is being afraid of being approached by people because they might start

water wastage for the society instagram one of the staff member asked me if she can record me reciting the poem and the president had to get her picture taken my video wa recorded so i went where the president wa getting her picture takeni look over at her  when i looked at her it reminded me of the sweet comforting and caring word she said to me and it all started playing back  reminder i am filled with anxiety here like it wa at it extreme i felt that i could just talk to her and cry to her about my anxiety and she would probably be really  understanding i just really wanted to talk to her and how sorry i wa for disappointing her while i am thinking all of that  i think made her feel really uncomfortable a she might have thought i wa looking at her chest cuz she wa trying to cover it up with her coat she did that  to  time before i got the message i think it wa too late and i made her feel really uncomfortable i really didnt want to the next day i avoided her so she doesnt have to deal with me and how uncomfortable i might have made her felt and might make her feel again fast forward to november i saw my chemistry teacher in the hallway and i said greeted him during that particular day my social anxiety wa acting up i stopped in the hallway and wa evaluating my greeting with the teacher a i usually didnt greet my teacher evaluating if i did anything wrong or awkward i stopped outside of a classroom window i wa so zoned and felt out of my body that  the people in the classroom were all blurry for a solid minute right in front of me were girl sitting their head turned towards mei wa frozen in that place and couldnt exactly move it might have looked like i wa staring at them which made them feel uncomfortable but i wa zoned out i think it wa the president of the environmental society i am not sure when i zoned back in i realized what it must have looked like and in my head i wa like shit shit shit anxiety filled my body and i quickly started walking away from the room so they dont feel even more uncomfortable again  i am not sure if it wa the president of that societya few day later there an assembly in the amphitheatre of the college i head over there and i see one of my childhood friend i look over at him and think about the funny memory i know how cheesy it sound but it true i wa thinking about the time when he used to call me black for instance i am brown pakistani a i had the darkest complexion my eye quickly darted to the president who wa sitting right in front of my childhood friend from that angle it must have looked like that i wa actually looking at hermy eye darted to her eye a she wa looking at me uncomfortably i notice her female friend lean in and  look at me that way a well i had already made her feel very uncomfortable so i quickly went to the opposite side of the amphitheatre for context my childhood friend alex and the president of environmental society are friend  my childhood friend aside from alex other friend who are also friend with the president in college have stopped talking to me altogether they used to meet me happily before the incident and now they dont even meet me whenever i meet them it like their is anger in their eye for making their friend feel uncomfortable and i understand that but i really and truly didnt mean to i think i am losing a lot of friend i have been cry and dont know what to do me zoning out isnt just limited to girl it ha happened with boy a well whenever i am walking school ground there this constant anxiety i feel now i fear that i will zone out and make someone feel uncomfortable again when i dont intend tomy childhood friend and i are from the same all boy school please help in this situationplease name are changed,anxiety1568,tldr a year ago i went to an old friend birthday party and it wa terrible now he inviting me again and feel conflictedthis anxiety isnt getting any better and im really struggling to make new friend so i feel like i really should go and try to keep the few friend that still remember my existence but at the same time i wouldnt want to relive a single minute of how i felt last year basically a year ago a friend that i havent seen in a while invited me to his birthday party and since we had a great friendship in the past and i even wa the funny guy when we were younger i accepted but then when i wa there it wa so damn awkward i just wanted to escape they were waiting for me to do a le funne but all the new people and his family were looking at me and shit all night so i stood quiet for the whole thing it also sucked because whenever i actually came up with something i said to myself nah it would only make thing worse only for one of his new friend to say the exact same thing i had in mind and make everyone on the room laugh and sht anyway now a year later he also invited me this time for god know what reason and im pretty conflicted about it on one side he still care enough to invite me even tho we barely talk to eachother anymore and id feel pretty bad since back in the good day wed get go to each others birthday on the other side im not the same guy from before and now i feel like a le carismatic boring and uglier version of myself there also probably even more new people now and it will get way more awkward than last time also i dont think his parent like me that much and i feel like they wouldnt want me there so if last time i wa sweating and holding my breath over a stupid dance i dont know how id handle it now but again i feel bad for saying no since he wa one of my best friend and i also rejected another birthday party from another friend of the group this year so yeah should i go or nah,anxiety1569,why do i have a fear of people finding me uninteresting,anxiety1570,removed,anxiety1571,removed,anxiety1572,because of my sa i commonly come off a stupid and constantly make mistake because im nervous at my workplace im known a ditzy and have even been told that i should of been born blonde because of how dumb i am blonde arent even dumb though it just when im being watched i tend to make more mistake because im nervous and i say stupid thing to people when im trying to make conversation because you guessed it im nervous and not thinking straight im not stupid im not ditzy im just nervous,anxiety1573,so i generally try to get away from social situation a fast a i can in school the faster i can get to a class and not have anyone talk to me the better i always rush through the hallway between class and i always sit down somewhere where no one else is sitting so that people only sit near me if they actually want to talk to me which almost never happens unfortunately for me our school ha an assembly every morning im not sure how common this is in other school but basically everyone in the school go to the hall first thing in the morning and some of the staff will show a videomake announcement on stage that part of the assembly isnt really the issue it more before it actually start i cannot bring myself to walk into a hall with every single student in the school there it just way too scary for me the problem is it cause me to get marked late sometimes when i actually came in on time i just didnt go into the hall because i wa too scared doe anyone have any idea on how i can help prevent this from happening,anxiety1574,i m just want to rant about it somewhere pretty long post but i just need to write all this somewherei hate i hate it so much i hate waking up each morning thinking ill magically be a different person but everyday when i get to school my sa take over and i just cant control itive been trying to get rid of it for month by now mainly because ive fallen in love with a girl were together in one period and she wa the one who decided to approach me at the start of the year and sit next to me the thing is that our pair of table are isolated from all the other classmate so it just the two of u sitting with each other shes basically the exact opposite of me in school the center of attention always talking and always energetic at first it seemed a though she showed a slight interest in me she would always talk about her day or crack joke but i would never know how to respond and i tried to change because i had fallen in love so every once in a while i would tell joke a well and she would laugh cutely but i could never keep up the energy and i would always go back to being quiet and confined to myself we even exchanged snap and texted four or five time but that wa it now it seems that i have deterred her away from me she doesnt talk with me a much now she mostly talk to the nearest other classmate plus shes always asking why im so confined and is always tell me to be more open so thats were i am at a of today it wa especially brutal to see that it had progressed to u just talking for  minute so yeah i felt shittier then ever today and just wanted to write a posti dont know exactly where my sa came from but i guess it the constant need to impress others i think that i have a fear that if i dont do perfect on a test if im not polite to others if i dont constrain myself to a simple quiet person that people will stop looking at me with acceptance but i hate that mindset i dont want to care about what others think about me i want to fail exam i want to skip class i want to scream at the top of my lung and be impolite and be everything that a dumb teenager is without giving a fuck most of all i just want to stop overthinking about every little detail i dont want to spend hour thinking about what to talk about with my crush i just want to be in the moment and enjoy itand the ironic thing about all this before high school i wa introverted both in school and out of it but two year ago i finally became an extroverted person outside of school nowadays when im with friend that ive know for year in public im not afraid to do dumb shit i dont give a fuck at however many people look at me weirdly if someone saw me with my friend in public they would think that all i do is live like each day is a party i never have nothing to talk about in fact i assume im probably the most annoying person my friend know and i come up with joke on the spot that even make me laugh and wonder how the hell did i think of that but something about school is like an impenetrable wall and i just dont know what i have to do to finally change myself i think that another aspect of my sa is my trust in other people it take a reallllly long time to reach a friend level status with classmate for me although most of the time people drop the effort to be my friend because they assume im not interested and once again this is really only an issue for me in school if i meet a stranger in public i could be acting a if ive known them for my entire life in under an hourso thats all i have to say im tired of living like this im tired of living a split personality and i wish that i could kill off my introverted self im scared that ill lose my shot on someone who i truly love and who possibly love me back im scared of all the opportunity ill lose because my sa say no but most of all im scared that if i dont get rid of this parasite now ill never enjoy the few year of my teenage i have left and ill be stuck with it for the rest of my life tomorrow im going to a social event at my school for the first time every bit of my brain is thinking of the million of way ill fuck it up or embarrass myself or how i wont enjoy it but im still throwing myself into it because worst case scenario im already at rock bottom so i wouldnt feel any shittier then i do now but thats alright a well because ill keep throwing myself over and over and over again no matter how much blood sweat and tear it take until i win ive lost too many chance to enjoy life up until now but i cant keep living in regret and there are still so many more chance in the future best case scenario i can finally change once and for all leave my old self behind and people can finally see who i really am have a great day ,anxiety1575,removed,anxiety1576,i dont know where to look what to do with my hand im overthinking everything im not comfortable,anxiety1577,like how do people join in convos im trying that rn but i always wait for the other side to start it bc if it me trying to join in or start the convo l think l am annoying them i get ignored a lot a lot like even on wp l never usually message in group chat bc l know ill get ignored anyway today for the first time l got the courage to start a convo by asking a question about physic in our group chat it like  ppl there and  ppl replied to my question and i asked about another detail and they have seen it but none of them replied back i dont think it wa a bad question or anything too i just dont know why it happens to me like these thought lead me to think that the problem is about how i look but l just dont think thats why i actallu never thought that l wa ugly never but when l started th grade l started getting quiter and started getting ignored so i thought l wa disgusting and that wa the reason ppl were ignoring me and l got depressed i really wanted to kill myself and take myself out of this world i didnt even have the strength to talk to someone not even one world i lived like a plant just pain and now i started to think that it might not be about my appearance and maybe personality but srsly why would someone ignore me like that on message why like she literally answered my first question and not the second even thought she saw it everyone saw it nobody replied back am l the problem why do you think it happens sorry if i made a mistake while im typing l type really fast and i dont wanna read that all again,anxiety1578,im literally considering quitting it wa so bad my social anxiety is so severe that im a wreck after my first day of work even tho i did nothing they could literally see how nervous i wa so my supervisor just let me take training quiz on the computer and tried to get me to talk to people also first thing in the morning when i went in somebody said something about me prob bc i said nothing and didnt make eye contact and she went stop it shes young which just made me think what are people gonna think of me if i still act how i do when im old i try so hard to hide how nervous i am but recently multiple time people have pointed it out even tho i try to hide it and my supervisor noticed so i told her i have social anxiety but i dont think she understands i have social anxiety like the mental illness shes very kind and sweet and i appreciate her so much for being gentle with me today but i dont think my new boss understand how bad it is for me multiple time she referenced me being shy and even did it once in front of others when i said no to her offer to walk with two of my coworkers people to somewhere in the hospital which is fine but her calling it shyness implies it something i can get over quick enough she also said stuff like ive had a few girl like you in the past youre gonna be chatting in no time this wa wellintended but made me feel worse because i dont think im going to be chatting anytime soon and what is she going to think when she realizes this also when i told her about my social anxiety she said playfully in reference to herself dont pull that infront of me a in dont be anxious around her which is fine except i feel bad because i cant help it you can be the sweetest most gentle person in the world and ill still be scared but others dont realize this so they take my anxiety around them personally sometimes this is what im afraid of with her i just feel horrible about myself i watched two of my coworkers who are girl around my own age talking to each other and i so badly wanted to say something but i knew whatever i said i wouldnt know what to do with i guess i just feel so fundamentally flawed a a human being and like there no place for me in the world i feel so terrible about everything im even considering if i should just go on disability i definitely feel disabled ive just been trying to recover on my couch im so tired of being so fucking anxious all the time i have  million different worry about work and my relationship with my coworkers and how im too quiet and weird to speak to them or fit in and how im gonna do a terrible job and etc when i wa younger i feel like i could get away with it now i feel like people just view me in a skewed light that i cant escape,anxiety1579,a teacher that i kinda have a tense relationship with always look at me and i dont want to give agressive or weak eye because i fear they will target me yes it happened before so how long should i keep eye contact with a superior and how should i break the eye contact also im asking this a if eye contact with normal v superior people should be different i dont how true that is thank you also english is not my first language so please help please,anxiety1580,yeah,anxiety1581,i m wont explain the hair but trust me when i say it awful it awful basically ive been having the same cut for like  year and a relative offered to do it for free and ha for year and it always looked incredible but yesterday i decided to go for a really big change and wa going to go out of my comfort zone to go to a barber but the relative wa insistent anyways he fucked it up majorly now i know i need to go to the barber to get it fixed but going with decent hair wa already dreadful enough now im gonna walk in with am embarrassment of a haircut which theyll probably laugh at and talk about with their mate and im absolutely dreading it im supposed to go tomorrow but i wouldnt be surprised if i put it off out of fear of embarrassment,anxiety1582,i dont know where to go with this i am afraid of besides having a social anxiety that i could also be a toxic person and nobody bother to tell mei wa part of a pretty stable friend group and we did voice chatting several time a week often i wasnt paying attention sometimes somebody would say something to trigger my reaction like something negative about cat it wa okay i knew they liked cat they had cat on their own but once i got in a really heated discussion via text about feminism notice im a woman myself and this person wa telling me all the stuff about why they think men have it so much harder in life than woman which wa just utter b to me i noticed the person avoiding voice chat after that and honestly i didnt mind because it tainted my perception of them badlyanother person often made some negative remark about trans people mind i do have a friend who is trans and so i could hardly tolerate his remark like the existence of trans people doesnt hurt his existence they dont take anything away from him maybe you get me and maybe half a year ago this made me snap to i wa so angry why couldnt he stop why would this person often say so much bullshit just to trigger my reaction they also often told me how i should avoid social medium because it wasnt good for me he completely ignored that i used it mostly for fandom stuff and i doubt this affected my health a i avoided think i didnt likebut that doesnt matter anymore after a few month of not interacting with those people i went back a few time they were mentioning they wanted to ask me to come back to continue playing a game with me where i had the save data that wa about a month agoi havent seen them in that voice chat since i hoped we could finish playing this game together but now it seems they started over without me since i can see the activity on steamand it hurt so bad like they werent really the best friend and we had argument but they actively trying to avoid me now this make me feel like i am a toxic person and im afraid ill end up entirely alone one day since it so hard for me to make friend thanks to this shitty social anxiety,anxiety1583,ive finally gotten to the point where i want to try making friend but it so hard to break the ice in person so many people my age   are either glued to their phone

person who loved to speak express share and socialize i dont know where wa the starting point or what the cause of my sa is but recently i wa talking to the psychologistworks a a pr manager who is my collegue at work i shared my problem about always criticizing myself worrying before presentation stressing at night thinking that i might have said or done something dumb that day a we discussed

waiting for the culmination i suddenly froze and my throat got dry i even had tear on my eye all of these were because i wasnt sure if the joke wa funny enough to make all of them laugh or smile at least other thing that made me realise is that i always put myself bottom on the way of my career i think low of me a a result im not able to motivate myself enough after realization i shared my feeling with couple of friend and family member i have a lot of people around me and they couldnt believe it they were like you the jokster one the speaker the popular oneim here to ask if im the only one who realized that too late or if there are people who are also good in hiding those fight inside and still doing their job that make it unbelievable for others that you have a sa maybe nobody can

about my hobby my parent dont understand my interest even if i try to let them know they generally avoid other culture or very advanced technology my sister is too young and too different from me and there arent any neighbor my age in this tiny village i live ini wa happier in kindergarten and primary schoolin kindergarten i wa the leader of sort i always suggested the game and had the best toy my  bffs were always with me i threw birthday party and everyone would come my friendship book wa fullin primary school that continued i wa one of the best in my class winning award for reading competition i wa in the center of the friend group and wa the one to introduce the trendsi think at the end of th grade something changed i didnt notice anything at that time but the center began to shift to other kid my female bff since early kindergarten who wa always by my side didnt talk to me a often anymorein the summer holiday after th grade everything changed i have never been in contact with some people from my friend group since then i didnt have a phone yet and somehow my female bff and i didnt talk for the whole holiday then we went to different school after i got a phone i once sent her a message on christmas but she didnt replywhen i got into gymnasium the best german school i wasnt at the top of the class anymore some of my old schoolmate including my male bff were with me at that school but we somehow didnt talk that much anymore i wa too dumb to realize where this wa going i didnt have many friend anymore only the kid i sat with in the break but with those friend i never met in privatein the th class of gymnasium my mark got worse but i didnt realize it because i had always been the best in school without learning i didnt know how learning worked i got hyperfixated on anime and didnt try to get closer to my semifriends that year wa the first year i didnt have a birthday party and i realized i didnt have any friend anymore also since then i wa always picked last in pe but that is probably because im chubby and nonathleticin th class the group i belonged to split apart because one kid left the school i started to sit with another group it wa the same a before i didnt really belong to them i wa an extra that year my latin class started and my mark got even worse i spiraled into an abyss of anime bad mark my parent are mad no one talk to me anime my mother sent me to a therapist for a short while to talk about my problem but all i did wa tell her about how i felt like no one understood me and she just listened it wa a helpful a me talking to myself or writing an autobiography like right nowat that time i still had  people i played with the neighbor granddaughter  year younger than me she visited her grandmother once a month and stayed over the weekend with her i felt a if i wa back in primary school together with her cousin we played adventure outside and had sleepover in my roomthe second person i wasnt that close with it wa the year older son of my mother best friend we got along fairly well but i always felt that we didnt have the same interest our age difference got very clear with him he went to the same school a me but wa managing his mark and wa overall maturei think i wa a late bloomer until th class all i wanted to do wa play with toy and watch anime i dont talk with both of them very often anymore because the girl moved further away and the boy is an adult now but id consider them my last real friend even though we didnt share the same interestsin th class the new group split again and i joined another my mark were so bad i had to go to the principal and decide to either stabilize my mark or change school i took private tutoring until the end but i had to change schoolsi changed into realschule one educational level lower than gymnasium it wa the school my female bff went to and yet we didnt talk again after she showed me my new classroom i had my hope up but i wa too incompetent to ask her to hang out again in th class but at a different school it wa different but not really i wa on top of the class again the teacher praised me for my general knowledge and my mark i still didnt have real friend when i entered the classroom for the first time i tried to look a approachable a possible but i messed it all up and again ended up in a semifriend group then covid and with it homeschooling a you can probably already guess i saw no one for those  year no illegal meetups not that anyone would have wanted to meet up with me and no phone call because we werent close enough in that time i built out my lasting fixation on anime now manga and web novel too at that time i watched almost everything if you do not believe me you can tell me an anime title and most probably i will know it of course i only grew more distant from any social interaction at that timein the th class school with mask in the classroom one person from the friend group changed to another class am i the destroyer of friendship but this time i stayed with the rest i still have the best gradesin th class my grade became slightly worse but still goodnow im in the th class this year i will graduate if i dont fail i think i can hold my grade but i got bad grade in math and chemistry english is the only subject i always get the best mark i wonder why answer subtitled anime manga and web novel fully in english  english mc streamer i must have read  full novel in that time in june the leader of the friend group i hung out with wrote a word text in which she basically said i wa annoying and that i should leave them alone she sugarcoated it so it sounded a if she wanted the best for me after that i became another friend group extra by that time i guessed how that must look on the outside my hopping around between friend surely made me look disloyal of sort after a few month i had enough now i am alone in the break and fantasize about the novel i readim completely clueless about what i want to do after graduating and dont have a dance partner for prom teen worry or what you call themall my life i just wanted to belong somewhere after writing this i realized that many thing are my fault too i always want to be loved without giving anything and in the end it made me avoided by everyone my parent try to make me a functioning member of society but im lazy and i dont have a single ounce of social capability endif you have read this you can judge me in the comment now ,anxiety1596,i just got off mirtazapine cold turkey like  week ago off kratom since friday  december had a relapse yesterday i

so far which is greatmy doc even prescribed me lyrica for daily use or whenever i need it but i never have been taking it more than once every one or two week a i wa and still am horribly anxious about lyricas own dependance and withdrawal that can be bad according to some people and that using it regularly just make my condition worse in the end and offer me another bad withdrawal time that put me even deeper to the ground of deep depressionas i suffer more than anytime probably because of withdrawing from kratom and mirtazapine while i thought mirtazapine ha no severe withdrawal might also only be the kratom withdrawal and i dont eat lost kglbs in these  week i dont sleep and feel very fucked insane cant move much or do anything functional i wa wondering if it would be the best to just go back on mirtazapine but otherwise im very happy and proud that i got off mirtazapine and dont have to take it daily anymore i just dont know what to do i know lyrica would help me if i continue taking it but i also know there can be harsh withdrawal for many people who take lyrica daily mirtazapine might have withdrawal too and maybe i should just use this opportunity to finally get off mirtazapine which even didnt help my depression much did nothing for my social anxiety but it made me eat and sleep which can contribute to improving depression mirtazapine is the th med im trying now without much or any success life still ha been a daily pain and suffering since trying these med and  different psychotherapy for  or more year nowwhat would you do in my position get on the lyrica train a many do and swear on but also many suffer from withdrawing in the end get back on mirtazapine and hope to be better in one or two week finally eating and sleeping again and getting back on my weight i always wa skinny but now am really thin cauese of not being able to eat or drink at allalso my doc just prescribed me lithium a my th med to try plus mg mirtazapine  my doc doesnt know that i quit it on last monday but a i dont suffer bipolar depression and i couldnt find any information or study for lithium being succesful for unipolar depression or social anxiety which is my biggest source of depression i just hesistated to take it until nowotherwise i also have many supplement left i still wanted to try and had hope that they can be finally heal me lavender extract bacopa rhodiola rosea extract same dopa mucuna lemon balm gotu kola extract magnolia bark extract gaba not bought yet but maybe wa thinking of kanna lion mane mushroom dxm low dose polygala tongkat ali can any of these be helpful for my withdrawal and depression and social anxiety even if  pharmaceutical med didnt helpits hard to decide which way to go a all of these med need time to work and i dont have the time or ability to suffer that long until i know if a med or supplement work or if it doe not lithium seems so unuseful for my issue a there are only study using it for bipolar but i dont have bipolar depression still my doc see a reason why she prescribed it to me i guess a next trial after  failed med and  failed psychotherapy i just dont see the reason a there is no science i can find behind it i could take mirtazapine and i know id probably start eating and sleeping again in  week thanks to mirtazapine but otherwise i think i might get dependent on it idk if this is withdrawal from mirtazapine or kratom or both but if it mirtazapine too id be better now off of it than prolonging the use and withdrawal of mirtazapine i surely wont touch kratom again for a while a ive really been dependent on it and it just fuck with my mental health after one week daily use and i also dont eat on it to get effect on empty stomach  it just isnt worth using it daily and i have to take a looong break from it until i can start using it like once a week max because i know when i only used it once a week it wa effective and giving me good result but daily use just worsens my state a lot i could continue lyrica with the very high risk for dependence and withdrawal when trying to quit it one day but i know it work for my social anxiety better than any med before even if it only a little lift otherwise many use it daily a no other med worked and they just pay the price for a bit of life quality and one day going off of it with bad withdrawal and maybe longterm damage  hows your experience with lyrica a therapeutical daily use for depression and social anxiety ever tried to get off of it is it possible or a very bad idea to use it daily even if it the only thing helping a bit i could try any of the above mentioned supplement i still havent tried i tried many others before without success but maybe you have some other supps that helped you with treatmentresistant depression and social anxiety when no other even strong pharmaceutical med didnt help but at that point i also think if strong pharmaceutical med couldnt help me or treat me right how could a supplement do i could ask for another medication than lithium i will surely tell my doc that i hesistated to try lithium until now a i couldnt find any study on it for my issue anywhere and wa overthinking of going on another med again just failing having no success and maybe side effect and withdrawal of it for no success or effect in contrary what med could i still try if  med didnt worki already tried these med and no one treated my depression and social anxiety not even touched it except for mirtazapine enabling me to eat more and sleep better escitalopram cipralex promethazine venlafaxine effexor quetiapine seroquel sertraline zoloft opipramol paroxetine paxil duoloxetine cymbalta moclobemide aurorix weakest maoi amitriptyline gabapentin diazepam valium mirtazapine remeron gt make me eat and sleep probably lil effective cause of helping with that bupropion wellbutrin pregabalin lyrica gt lil effectiveall no success plus  depth psychological

worked so far for me a wrong diagnosis atomoxetin modafinil ritalin dexamphetamin lisdexamfetamin other benzos clonazepam bromazepam alprazolam oxazepamany idea what youd do in my position rn i dont eat and just starve all the time i dont drink i dont sleep this is very unhealthy so i have to do something plus my horrible depression and social anxiety not enabling me to go out see friend just canceling all appointment dont visit university anymore and probably just have to quit my master degree and never make real friend or romantic relationship having no future in sight while also being cognitively very retared and probably just turned dumb no skill no knowledge just no future and no strength or anything i could offer anyone  and the anxiety i could never catch up on all these thing skill knowledge and experience other already have in my age im  nowi feel like ive missed out on a lot of experience and knowledge to survive in adulthood even if let say survive depression and social anxiety itself i dont know i surely remember when i first noticed my mental health issue that my deep depression had big impact on my cognition and joy or ability to learn thing the social anxiety contributed to this cogntive performanceability in public of course now i dont know if it might have been all the many different med i tried or the depression or a combination which made me so freaking dumb that kill my hope for being able to live a normal life even if id be able to finally ever feel not fucking hellishly depressed and freakingly socially anxious once these are thought like i just dont have learned any skill any knowledge about any topic or profession might it just be football basketball following it on the tv and knowing about player i dont know anything about car or mechanic a some men my age do and make them somehow manly for me i cant play any instrument or dont play any sport in a team i dont know anything about politics or any science topic im just blank only positive i see is that im at least a good looking young man a good looking loser i feel so unmanly because of not knowing anything about this stuff and have no skill or knowledge i can offer make me suicidal and reducing my self confidence and self worth a lot i wa really often thinking about having add but started only very late or no one rarely urged to test me on this a i have social anxiety and by that surely am not the hyperactive adhd type  i heard the missing h part is the reason why many adhd patient get ignored even if the attention deficit disorder is still fully presenti really have big hope on med even if  different one didnt work yet but i dont know how my life could change other than a med supplement or any substance being finally effective and supporting me cause i tried so much therapy diet sport  they only help a little and i really think it just my brain chemistry and it cant get better without any substance helping me even my new doc said this type of depression and anxiety i have can only be solved by pharmaceutical help or biochemical influence from the outside a so much didnt help me until now and i tried so muchsorry for the long text this make me see that lyrica helped me to day with my issue a otherwise i would never have the energy to write so much and not feel bad and just crawl into my bed doing nothing than starving and staring on the wall or trying to sleep and just not feel my horrible feeling of depression self hate and future anxiety i really am living unhealthy now so at this moment i really take even withdrawal of lyrica just to survive but idk if this is a very bad idea i try to not take it tomorrow but maybe i feel so horrible again that i have to at least eat one meal drink a bit of water get out and get something done for university or other todos i just skipped for  week now,anxiety1597,just wanted someone to vent to lmao im kinda dreading it because like most haircut they mess it up or it really awkward,anxiety1598,im tired of people disregarding social anxiety a shynessthats happens to everyone work on it business do not like shy peoplethe other day i wa w some friend and i decided to tell them that i have social anxiety and apologise for my shitty behaviour when im anxious i tried explaining but i wa cut short and realised it made no sense trying to show themthey answered yeaaa used to happen the same for me youll get over it in a couple month dw it perfectly fineno you havent gone through that you havent been in your bathroom cry thinking you are the most stupid and embarrasin human being you havent isolated yourself for week you havent hit yourself thinking you are worthless useless and ridiculous youve never skipped class just because you felt so ashamed of yourself that couldnt even look at urself in the mirrorshyness is not social anxiety social anxiety is a mental disorde the worst and most disabling thing that ha happened to me and im tired of people crossing it a shyness and telling me ill get over it and everyone go through this no they dont they wouldnt last a day with my brain,anxiety1599, it very special to have a life partner with whom you can talk and tell everything youre going through but unfortunately i lost it a month ago i dont know what the reason wa but even if she wasnt my life partner i would like her to stay a my friend i hope someone who make someone with schizoid personality disorder feel this way will be happy for the rest of their life but what i learned in this process is that being able to explain yourself to someone without the judgmental voice in my head is a unique feeling i think i will miss her very much but i will miss this feeling even more than her,anxiety1600,after  month of constant texting it become unavoidable that we should probably talk to each other for real once im so scared of it though because i really want to make a good first impression and not fuck it upi thought maybe talking with someone else first in a lower stake situation could be good practice for the real thing we could play a game like minecraft gta or whatever else you own it doesnt really matter the important thing is there something to talk about if i dont know what else to say,anxiety1601,most of my life i wa socially avoidant until people came to me it sucked but in a way that made me feel safe i felt like i wa doing the rejecting i wa choosing to be aloneive felt so lonely since moving to a new city that ive been trying very very hard to put myself out there lately it hurt in a new and different way i feel like no one genuinely want to be around me i feel like im trying to convince people to give me a chance like i need to be able to pitch why im a worthwhile person to be around when i dont even know if i am it been over a year since ive been here now and i feel like i have a couple surface level friend but i dont feel any closer to making the kind of relationship i need i feel like a backup plan it feel like im fighting with my social anxiety putting in x the effort and still coming away empty handed just because i suck at this it draining and it make me feel woranyone relate,anxiety1602,anyone else ha the issue to be nervous when having an appointment with new people new situation i get heart racing for about  minute and than everything is fine i really enjoy being around people and my social skill a very good i dont think about what people could think of me or anything else just knowing i have a new situation make me nervousbut it end always the same gt

friend i wa able to speak with classmate and friend with ease now it very hard for me to speak to others even when i need help now im a loner in school and rarely talk in school,anxiety1605,ive had a group of friend since moving to the city a few year ago we dont hang out a frequently a we used to but i still talk to most of them several time a week even if it not too indepth this weekend i saw on social medium they all went on vacation together somewhere upstatei had no idea this wa even being planned we all share a group chat together and it still pretty active so i assume at one point they made a group chat without me so they could plan their getaway together i had to find out from instagram story of all place that this wa happening and started texting people to ask hey what the hell is going on basically i got no answersi still feel completely confused humiliated and hurt i dont understand why i wasnt invited or if i did something that caused offense and i dont understand why people i thought were my friend couldnt be upfront with me if that wa the case i cried myself to sleep every night this weekend and woke up feeling like shit every day im at work and i can barely focus i just feel like i need an explanationi have a lot of lingering childhood pain from always being the odd one out being excluded being picked last etc this isnt the first time it happened to me but it definitely hurt the most because i got so secure in this friend group being lgbtq a well it so hard to find people you really connect with and i thought these folk were my people having to reevaluate that over the last few day ha been nothing but pain pain pain ugh,anxiety1606,   okay so here a little background i am a person that easily get irritated and frustrated which make me usually yell to my friend one of my friend make fun of my interest to rile me up because my frustration is funny to her let call her a once i accidently insulted her because  she started to frustrate mewe didnt talk for  day ik it isnt long but it wa like hell because other friend of ours a year older than u let call her bwould go to keep her company they would talk even after the bell rung and i felt like i wa not important because b wouldnt turn her back and attempt to talk to me a and i sit together b would get in between u which resulted in her to turn her back to me in order to talk to her which made me remember my toxic friendship in th grade my social anxiety wa at it peakest during that time and i would take everything they said to heart which is why i am so insecure about this that week wa the worst because i started to notice little pattern in their behaviour  that shouldnt matter in a friendship because i wa once again reminded of th gradei even cried when i got home and in school   now i dont share my interest with them that much anymore and try to not get irritatedthey judge me and when i tell them it not funny they laugh especially a because friend a is the head of mischief and the b is the enabler however though i do share sometimes with the b little sister shes the same age a me let call her c though she sometimes also make fun of me when a initiate it it lighthearted but it is enough to make me feel sad because they team up they all usually gang upon me maybe it because i am pretty small compared to them they also dont wanna do anything i want to do friend a usually want the opposite again to rile me up and friend b follows her like a dog friend c follows them because it what the majority want in my opinion that is she almost never complains and always obeys   i am of course not forcing anyone to do anything but honestly it feel like they dont care about me that a much a they care about eachother ,anxiety1607,it weird like say im on my own ordering a drink at a bar im fine but a soon a im with a family member i hate it and cant do it myself,anxiety1608,mine some music made by michael jackson,anxiety1609,some text,anxiety1610,ive always adored daydream i get to create my own imaginary world where i actually have best friend who think about me and whom i love very muchthats my issue i cant find a best friendyeah sure i have friend now but i dont have the best friend that i daydream about my friend dont really text me first like ever nor do they ever start conversation with me much theyre nice yeah but at the same time they just dont satisfy my ever lasting hunger for human connectionsometimes i feel pointless and invisible and meaningless like people never remember me or care about me that much i just wish i had someone a guy who would always text me first ask me to hang out stay with me the entire school day and most importantly never forget about meive been daydreaming about this since th gradei like to sing mitskis song remember my name every time i think about thisi need someone to remember me i need something bigger than the sky hold it in my arm and know it mine just how many star do i need to hang around me to finally get somewhere i can be all done somewhere like heaventhats how i feel i want someone bigger than the sky who i can hold in my arm and now is minelately ive started daydreaming about making a circle of friend with these  imaginary guy and we would go around and have fun little adventure together and we would all care for each other and never forget each otherso yeah i need help managing my daydreaming and loneliness problem im getting therapy right now but i like to write down mj thought and post them since it help me manage my thought,anxiety1611,two year ago i wa totally confident of myself but now my jaw started to grow out of nowhere and i have a deviated and extremely long jaw that make me look stupid because it doesnt even match my face since then i cant be happy even with my family i dont feel like myself and it cant be more obvious that everyone treat me with pity literally  month ago i looked like a different person but now i dont even want to eat outside because i chew like a fucking cow and i look angry like a bulldog i need to wait  year for my surgery and i feel like my life is on pause until i have it,anxiety1612,when i first went there i am quite sure i told her my age few month later i had my birthday i had expectation towards myself being that age  i should be proper adult normal job etc i am nowhere near any of it so saying my age make me feel ashamed anyway few month after my birthday she asked me how old i wa i politely said something along the line closer to  than to  so you can more le get the idea how old i am she kept insisting asking playing with pause i didnt say at the end of the meeting i noticed that she wa visibly irritated   annoyed i wa going there for month it wa the first time i saw her like that she wa always just polite nice so it wa visible i felt uneasy after that session but i kept going there  month later she asked again i dont believe she forgot or anything she kept insisting even though i know she remembered me not wanting to answer i wa stupid enough to say because i felt cornered why do you need to know my age you know my story how doe it matter if i am  or  obviously to judge me it wa pretty obvious from the conversation that she judged me saying between the line how i shouldnt feel how i feel at that age and asked me how i have money even though she didnt ever care about it before and i wa going there for month i quit therapy it wa few month ago but i still feel ashamed about it i feel ashamed that i wa so stupid to trust her with anything i am never doing this again it actually proved my fear that people will judge if you are not someone at certain age,anxiety1613,not only i wa new to the environment my aunt ha been treating me unfairly verbally abusing me insult me etc right after mass end this ha been going on for  night alrdy and the previous week i didnt think it get that worse and my parent are in a different continent i cannot just tell them thru message that aunt is acting like a total bitchwe do nightly mass before christmas it a tradition we have but today my anxiety is getting worse and i have no energy to go with her and it always crowded we have to stand the whole time outside and i have no energy to complete nightly mass,anxiety1614,my sa manifest a clamming up and fidgeting to the point where i have bandage on my hand im kind of tired of hearing from the life of the partyloudest person in the room that they have social anxiety too i dont understand it it feel totally different is there something im missing with coping in the moment is someone able to shed some light on this for me im incredibly confused a these seem contradictory to me,anxiety1615,im gonna be  soon and still ive got no friend never really had any all i do sleep eat go to class and then come back home and repeat i sometimes go out alone but when i see everyone hanging out in group i start thinking about  myself why keep suffering if this is never gonna go away  there no light at the end of the tunnel ive been like this since i wa  i have no doubt in my mind that sa is the root of all of my mental issue without it ill happy,anxiety1616,so uh basically im currently trying to work on building self esteem particularly in reference to my appearance alot of my social anxiety is how others perceive me in term of self image i very much wish it wasnt that way and ive made alot of progress considering where i startedfour year ago i started my battle with anorexia a coping mehcanism stemming from my home life and undiagnosed general anxiety  adhd im very happy to say it been a year since id consider myself fully mentally recovered from it im also in a very good place with how my anxiety and adhd is being manage which is really nice and a tbh excitinghowever i am at likely the highest weight ive been a i wa on bed rest for a while after a recent surgery lost alot of muscle  not being able to move around doe that im cool with it a long a im physically healthy but it is taking some getting used to so today i went on a walk beacuse i wanted to and refused to let my anxietynegative feeling dictate my life and know that id much rather see the sky and just relax outside than be locked inside all day i wa right too it wa really nice despite what happened next i wa crossing some traffic light and one guy shouted something like heyyyyyy really loudly followed by something else i couldnt pick up it kinda sounded like nice i had my back turned to themwalking away and wa literally wearing sound cancelling in ear heaphones so you can imagine im suprised i could even hear it thinking id dropped something or idk crossed the road when i wasnt supposed to i looked back and saw them looking at me while smirkinglaughing but also looked kinda sheepish idk it wa just confusing in the back of my mind i cant help but think they were mocking making fun of me because they think im wildly unnatractive not a helpful thought but one thats there atm i glanced back again when i wa much further away and still saw them looking at me idk how to take this if it idiot being idiot fair enough but why did they think they knew me or something where they making fun of me because i look funny or bad i would really appreciate hearing what you guy think about this and how to move on from thinking about it,anxiety1617,removed,anxiety1618,feeling really bad right now today i had to do an oral presentation but i had a panic attack and had to leave before it wa my turn to expose feeling like i am a failure,anxiety1619,so i just started therapy about  month ago and it took me about  year of constantly getting worse until i finally got myself to do somy social anxiety is the main reason im going to therapy and in the first few week i think i made small progress that i wa really proud of my therapist would say we start with small thing to get myself used to social situation again stuff like buying grocery and then we would go from there i took these thing a task that have to be done or my therapist would be disappointed if i dont and in term of anxiety it wa basically level easy for me so it wa kind of an easy winbut now shes giving me task to do that are a huge step out my comfort zone  and im really not sure i can do them until i see her again next year i knew before that therapy isnt going to solve all my problem in a few week but right now we only talk about stuff thats been going on this week and what i could do until our next appointment to improve my anxiety so in the end im still the only one who can improve my situation and i couldnt do it in the year before so i am just not sure if therapy is going to help me do it maybe it still too early to judge because  month isnt really a long time for therapyi dont knowi dont really have friend lol who wouldve thought who are in similar situation that could encourage me or that i can talk to in depth about itso im just wondering if people in similar situation feel a helpless a i do and what happens if i cant fulfill the task my therapist is me asking to do i know i have to do the stuff that scare me continuously otherwise it only get worse but it feel impossible rn if people with similar bad anxiety have already overcome this and got better id love to hear your storiesadvicetldr im scared therapy wont help me overcome my social anxiety,anxiety1620,full disclosure i have sa myself i am no expert buti believe everyone ha different level of sa i myself like my alone time and more often than not people drain metheres this co worker at work i have been chatting with and long story short she just come out of a relationship desperate for friend and ha been bugging me to get coffee outside work unfortunately she ha no respect for boundary shes an open book about her life and expects me to be the same like she keep asking me who i like in the office after telling her many time  i do not want to tell you also she admitted shes attracted to me and one time got jealous because she noticed i spoke to another female colleague on team when she wa next to me explaining an it issueshe keep trying to get me to meet outside work and honestly the more a person bug me to hangout the more i refuse and find that person mad irritating yesterday i told her flat out that right now im not comfortable meeting outside work and i might never be comfortable so forcing it doe not help i also told her that i need space but today she bugged me again asking if she did anything wrong doe anyone else feel this way angry irritatedwhen people bug you to hang out and open up,anxiety1621,im sitting here looking at a chat on my discord with people i dont know thinking that i wish my life wasnt this way im sure my former bully from the past would be pleased to know that i became someone so lonely isolated and that i would never ever have a girlfriend who would have thought looking back at the way i envisioned this going to happenanyway i want to radically change myself because i have no alternative i cant kill myself and my life wont just end out of nowhere but i dont know where to start either ive thought about starting to make video on tiktok make friend on discord but i feel weird for bothering going to omegle but people just want to troll starting playing valorant to interact with girl and simply sharing my photo here on reddit on rrateme to feel more valid ive even thought about emigrating to another country because i feel that my parent undermine my selfisolation behavior and because the country where i live portugal is old and it very difficult to make friend with young people,anxiety1622,ive been friend with this guy for over a year now and i know he ha had a major crush on me since the beginning i never felt like that for him though until recently when ive been starting to wonder if there might be something there  i think i may be demisexual though so these thing are kinda harder for me to figure out so we are giving it a try and ended up kissing tonight it may be because he doesnt know this wa kinda my first kiss and it wa just a bit much but it just felt so weird i didnt feel any spark or butterfly and it wa almost even gross i just am sad it wasnt enjoyable i feel like maybe there something wrong with me i dont know what to think about it all,anxiety1623,i have always had a difficult time socialising and prefer to keep to myself more or spend time with very specific people that i feel safe around i grew up in an abusive household mostly verbal which may have added to this but not sure  anyway ive always had friend and i think people do like being around me but recently im feeling that le and le i used to overcome my social anxiety by drinking which helped when i wa at event although the anxiety wa worse the next day because i would black out and forget what i did i wa also sexually assaulted twice while drinking  when i wa drinking i had more friend socialised more and felt more included  last year i moved out with my best friend  it came to a point where she wa sick of my drinking and i really didnt want to upset her so i quit drinking for good  it ha now been a bit over a year my body feel a lot calmer and im proud of myself for quittinghowever the drawback of not drinking are that i rarely go out unless i know the event is important to another person  such a their birthday i never go on date i would just prefer to stay at home by myself or see people in very small dosesthe reason i ask this is that my best friend roommate and i have been having a problem where i get anxious when her boyfriend is over and avoid them by going to my parent or staying in my room theyve tried to hang out etc but i usually avoid it because of this they started going to his house more to make me feel comfortable which is unfair and she is bothered by my lack of effort  i wanted to make it up to her so i invited them both to hang out yesterday in order to push myself out of my comfort zone  going into it i felt confident and ready but during the hangout i wa extremely awkward and quiet i had no idea when to speak or how to act which ruined the day because it change the atmosphere when someone is barely speaking  ive been anxious all day because i feel like i let them down by acting this way and i really want to make thing better we havent talked much all day and when i messaged her saying i hope yesterday wa okay all she said back wa yeah you  i think she might feel weirded out by me and disappointed with how thing went  one on one i am usually fine and can socialise normally but whenever there is another person  or people i dont know well it completely differenti dont want to completely isolate myself forever but i just end up feeling worse about myself whenever i try to socialise more what do i do,anxiety1624,so i had finally found the courage to go to a bar alone thinking i would try to socialize and then i met those  girl in the street and asked them what wa the best bar to go where it is possible to socialize with other people and then i asked them if it wa weird that i wa going alone and they said yes like a big yes im a girl btw so i left before i even got into the bar and now my social anxiety is back guy and i am convinced everyone think im weird and feel sorry for me if i go to a place alone,anxiety1625,honestly to me friend are really important but i always push them away no matter what a i feel like im too clingy to them and disturbing them constantly like i feel insignificant in their life and they could always live a per normal wo me yet they are so important to me so i feel it always a one sided friendship maybe this is due to a lack of self worth but i really feel like i dont add value to anyones life in the end although i really want to i crave attention and love yet with social anxiety i cant go out and actively seek it it just so confusing,anxiety1626,i am tired of feeling being watched all attention on me i dont want go outside because i have to walk  and i dont know whom i will meet on my way and i feel like they will laugh at me because they may think i am stupid because my dad also say i am stupid,anxiety1627,i am  nd year uni student barely have any friendsi am trying my best to break out of my shell and for the first time in my life i think i have a crush on this social girlhowever it not that i want to be with her or anything but i cant help but feel like since i have social anxiety i will never get to do some thing like asking out a girl i like outwhich make me feel extremely distant from the world and in return make my anxiety and depression worse,anxiety1628,i am so fed up can anybody help please i used to count myself

overcome my fear i stuttered a lot but i managed to convey my point of view and finished to the end in the end the teacher said that i did a good job sure it a little embarrassing but it such a relief for me,anxiety1630,this wa one of my more recent discovery i never noticed it because i did everything in my power to prevent it without knowing when i wa growing up i never talked hardly at all or did anything out of line and when something would happen by accident i felt so embarrassed and ashamed after i made too many mistake i would self sabotage so that i felt in control of the negative reaction now im at the point where i have no idea who i am ive been trying to find myself but ive been seeing that i cant accept the part of myself that could be perceived negatively anytime someone disagrees with me or doesnt like something about what i saiddid i get incredibly anxious and overwhelmed and dip from the situation immediatelydoes anyone else deal with this how do i overcome it or at least manage it,anxiety1631,removed,anxiety1632,i wa going to get donut with my exfriendroommate and at the last second they said i had to go in by myself to get them and they would wait in the

for thing still i know how i am  i hate myself for it it on my mind near constantly it so debilitating being called out by another person for it make it much more real ,anxiety1633,i went to an early christmas gathering with my step mom dad and  sibling i love my step family to death they are my family and ive known them for  ish year just adding step for context they live around  hr away so

say i dont want them to think i dont want to talk because thats not the case i just cant i want to make joke and be at ease i just dont know how ive thought maybe im on the spectrum for a few year but i havent really asked for help maybe unrelated but ive been exhibiting sign of ocd for  year now i havent gone to any sort of therapy so it undiagnosed and i know those can have common symptom all in all i just want to befeel normal,anxiety1634,i feel like a chump being unable to talk about anything really with anyone im cool with,anxiety1635,i wa hosting a small get together for my seventeenth birthday one of my close friend ditched me for some dumb reason i can see through the lie im not stupid the reason she gave were definitely lie i already have very few friend i have major social anxiety it just hurt to see someone you thought wa your friend do that i did so much for her birthday not that i did it while expecting something in return i did it because she is my dear friend least i can expect is for her to show upi always help her out with anything she need not gonna do that now i help her a lot during and before exam she can fend for herself now left her message on seen the one where she said she cannot make itdidnt even have the courtesy to privately message me did it on a group chat she can get losthate to admit but im angry i know it not a good emotion to have,anxiety1636,i wa at a neighborhood block party tonight and it started off so well but a the night went on my social battery quickly depleted and i feel like i accidentally made someone really uncomfortable because of my weird presence  i feel like i can have a conversation with someone and act fairly normal but if the conversation go on too long i start to get nervous and in turn make the other person uncomfortable resulting in a negative experience kinda suck man,anxiety1637,i am  have really bad social anxiety im too shy to even look at people around my campus especially girl i feel like a creep going to talk to them because i know i find them attractive it feel twofaced and that im leading them on or something i look down at the ground all time so i dont leave it open that i wa looking at them which would probablly creep them outdispite all this i really want to meet someone special i dont think i will though ive looked for advice but it ha not changed anything im still cold and shy it is like im born without something in my brain that is used in making connection with peopleive recently tried to stop myself from devloping crush on girl i do happen to look at and go out of my way to avoid them if i think im getting attracted to them i dont want to give myself false hope that ill ever be able to ask them out sometimes i tell myself they are gay or already have someone and this help someim still scared though of being lonely later in life when it is too late to find someone is there a way to stop feeling attraction physically and emotionally to others it just feel like it taunting me at this point,anxiety1638,hi so i have a hard time trying to explain thing so ill try my best here so i dont know why but i always feel really bad for making little mistake in term of social situationslike if i have to use the restroom or if i am standing in line for something i accidentally cut in line i dont mean to do it for instance last night i ate at a fast food joint with a friend of mine and i needed to use a restroom so i got up and went up to the door and i saw the door is occupied from a walking distance but before i even stopped to wait in line the daughter that wa waiting outside for her dad by the bathroom said someone in there with a annoyed look and i just said oh and  awkwardly waited until he left another instance is that a couple of day ago i went to a basketball game for my birthday and i guess there wa a line to take picture next to a statue i wa there with my family and we were standing right in front of the line again we didnt know it wa the front because usually there is always a worker there guiding people so someone said are you guy want a picture we said yes and then he said if you want a picture the line is that way there wa an awkward silence and i felt really hot and anxious because everyone wa watching u so me and my family walked away i just get embarrassed by little mistake like that because it make me feel like i am the most stupidest person in the world i have very low self esteem issue and i have a hard time trying to stand up for myselfi always let people push me around doe anyone else feel this way,anxiety1639,i have really bad sa and i feel like ill never meet someone i get too shy to talk to pretty much anyone let alone people im attracted to and wish to ask out i hope this doe not come off a incely in nature but i just really would like to meet someone and be able to ask them outi want someone to spend time with to eat with and talk to to kiss to cuddle but it all seems so far away i know im only  and i still have time but i never socialize with people and try to find that special someone i do use dating apps tho but i have had no luck with them and will probablly delete them soon tbh someone wont just stumble into me especially if im shy right i have to go out and look for them and im so scared to do thatdo i have any hope i feel like ill be in my s done with college and never have talked romantically to a girl or have been on a date i know this shouldnt be the sole reason for wanting a partner but i also dont want to be an old man one day and have nobody in my life and it be too late to meet anyone,anxiety1640,so lately ive been experiencing bout of anxiety and typically i dont get it in social setting and ive found that usually when it happens it because of a crush i have on someone here lately ive been crushing on a friend and it been eating me alive i know he probably doesnt see me in that sense but because were both in the same circle of friend and we see each other fairly often the anxiety just skyrocket and i find myself pulling away this is a fairly new circle of friend and my typical goto in situation like this is to distance myself entirely because even in time when im not near the group of friend or the individual i start thinking about him and it doesnt get any better doe anyone have any tip on how to deal with this type of situation,anxiety1641,so im starting a new job and am planning on night sleeping the night before i will go for a run a few hour before my start time to i will feel like as bit at least a little le

dollar tree today and we stopped by the glass jar i wa telling him how i used to bake edible brownie in high school using the mason jar method and a lady came around the corner and asked what we were baking i felt uncomfortable because  we were talking about weed and were both underaged and  i felt like she wa using a mocking tone like she wa about to tell u off for talking about weed so i said what and she repeated herself and then i said weed and she looked shocked so i just started walking away but my boyfriend told me later it seemed she wa just curious about what we were baking in an innocent way but i took it a completely different direction it made me feel extremely anxious embarrassed and uncomfortable,anxiety1645,i know at this point it may seem weird it physically uncomfortable toobut still covering half of my face gave me confidence boost and im considering to start wearing againit hurt being insecure about my face  or being insecure and ugly whatever,anxiety1646,im f and he m we are both law student in the uk though im obviously doing an undergrad law degree and he doing a master we met at a chamber event and i wa with one of my good friend  the three of u got along very well so i thought that we were just a friendly trio despite him being so much older he wa very touchy during the event and kept grabbing my leg though i had a feeling he wa interested but decided to just brush ib off i did mention my boyfriend to him anyway my friend and i exchanged number with him that day and planned to meet up again a a group of three fast forward a month later he just texted me and asked how i wa doing and asked if i wanted to get drink with him he also asked if thing were going well with my boyfriend they are i suggested that we just get lunch or coffee and then he suddenly suggests dinner on friday night i insisted on lunch or coffee because i wasnt comfortable with drinking or going out at night with him and he suggested changing the plan and told me he would later suggest a date more convenient for me did he ask me out,anxiety1647,yes,anxiety1648,i can see myself getting more and more anxious the more time i spent in my room the easiest way to explain it is that i put on an act whenever i go out of my room the more i stay outside the more i do the acting the better i get at it but it tiring and i see myself getting gradually worse i mean apperantly i wa really talkative a a child my parent always ask me what went wrong where it went wrong i mean i never woke up and chose to be this way i dont even know when it started or did it just never end well still the introusive thought are getting worse i am dodging about  of social event i dream and think about suffering physically and mentally not really suicidal thought but i atleast never cry i mean it ha been that way a long a i can remember some people call me emotionless which i agree with tbh also i am realising that being lonely is feeling a lot more lonely that it used to be doe that even make sense basically i mean that before i would be alone in my room school and so on  and i would not mind at all even more so i wa afraid of changing anything about that i couldnt imagine myself being anything else than lonely but now feel lonely and i feel bad about being lonely it just hurt to always be by myself it feel wrong to always put an act on i just feel like im just supposed to be this way but it also feel like i dont know who i am or what i am but in the end im still better of than some people that i read about on here  it is pretty selfish of me to go on about stuff like this when there are people much worse off then i am in the end i just wrote down everything that came to my head so there really no white lining to this these are just my thought which i once in a while write down because it make me feel better,anxiety1649,sooo i met this awesome girl on bumble bff and this is our third time hanging out i had

caused the ops departure and i shouldve known since he wa also speaking english in a rather mocking and sarcastic tone i tried saving face by saying that it wa a joke to piss him off but it wa so fucking obvious that wa not the case and before i had time to delete my first reply this girl who wa a rather close friend of mine and some other girl i really admired saw it and i felt so fucking embarrassed that i deleted my reply and then my account altogether i wa in the community for le than a month and only started posting and engaging for a week anyways so it wouldnt really matter but although im not there anymore even thinking about how some people are gonna remember that awkward interaction and the fact that i wa a part of it haunt me besides i feel so unfathomably

the presentation teacher spun a wheel with all our group i wa really hoping i wasnt first but wa and it wa completely fine i spoke and my voice didnt shake or anything i didnt stutter or speak quietly

thing mind you i have been at a bar before with a couple of his friend he knew i wa anxious and he made it so we only stayed for about half an hour to an hour but still i had an anxiety attack before

talkative i wa asking lot of question and i couldnt stop talking apparentlyis this a normal thing that from a very talkative child you will became socially awkward person who is afraid to talk to almost everyonei am afraid to talk to a stranger because i always think that they would find it weird speaking with me even without complitely knowing me and i always get mad when speaking with parent

social anxiety who is a virgin this stuff make me really sad and angry every time i see it it not their fault i dont blame anyone for making these meme it their choice but im just bitter i guess hearing love song on the radio make me sad seeing kissing on tv doe the same even seeing a beautiful woman strut her stuff make me sad because i know i cant ever be with someone like this because talking to people make me scared idk how others can be so casual about such stuff to the point where they actually enjoy hearing sad break up song maybe it just because i recently experienced limerence idk but im sure it related to social anxiety and my bitterness concerning social activity i feel im missing out in,anxiety1669,sometimes when im in public and my social anxiety ill physically try to close myself off from the world by either covering my face or wearing my hoodies hood or even going to the bathroom and hiding there i wa wondering if anybody else here feel the need to hide from everyone sometimes,anxiety1670,i dont know anything about football but im trying my best to not make it obvious but i am getting really nervous and anxious ive gone out for a while for

nite after knowing him  mths weve been seeing each other x a week i have a  year old and he ha a  yr old and  yr old we are both in our late s he such an extrovert and im a hybrid between extrovertedintrovert sleeping over for the first time when you have social anxiety is like an anxious experience im like omg am i going to fart in the middle of the nite what happens if i cant sleep and he will find out im a freak w sleeping issue omg he going to see my adult acne with no makeup on at nite then i took klonopin to help relax at nite to sleep and my mouth wa like cotton mouth so im like he going to hear my dry as mouth making noise im not looking for advice i just wanted to share that you all are not alone social anxiety is a debilitating disorder ive tried it all exercise nature meditation positive thinking counseling benzos i truly think the only thing that help is zoloft but man doe it interfere w sex drive so im back on  mg zoloft  i guess it a cross we all must bear but let me tell you the people that have social anxiety are unique and stand outtypically we are empathetic people that others migrate towards i never had a problem making friend because i analyze everything and how i came across to the person and if i treated them well we are unique but beautiful people even if we do have social anxiety hang in there all remember nobody perfect everyone ha a cross to bear  much love,anxiety1674,i used to have a bunch of cringe attack which is when i would randomly get hit with a wave of cringe from something i did in the past ive seen a lot of people here mention the same thing happening to them too so i hope this help someone a much a it ha helped methe main thing i do is try to vocalize exactly what i did in the cringy memory and why it make me cringe it is important to actually vocalize it so either speak out loud or mouth out the wordsso an example of what i would mouth out would be when i interrupted him and then stumbled over my word it seemed like i interrupted him without having anything to say im worried everyone thought i wa rude or dumb make sure to mouth out every word dont let your brain fill any gap in the word with vague feeling or memory the point is to turn those feelingsmemories into full sentencesampxb tldr vocalize what you did and why it make you cringe when you think about itampxbanother thing that ha helped me wa never actively disproving the idea that i did something cringy trying to fight against the embarrassment i felt only made me feel conflicted and tired and it never seemed to help really delving into the memory and finding the specific reason that i felt embarrassed helped me more than forcefully trying to put thing into perspective ever didmy theory for why this work is that when i only think about these memory in my head i tend to just feel the cringe without processing it in any way this led to me having cringe attack about thing that happened year ago like elementary school even though im like  lmao thinking about what the other th grader could have assumed about me felt kinda goofy but it worked a the cringe attack kept rolling in i just processed each one a they came and now i rarely get them at alli hope this help someone shoutout to anyone who read this far,anxiety1675,i quit prozac and actually have self control i feel like since i got my confidence people think im an angry person but thats just me not being nice all the time i have slowed down on weed and only smoke once a day now but i still have trouble going to school i have found even little hobby or  distraction help  take my mind of thing and i am not depressed just a little awkward im going to go to school all week tmrw and not sit in my brother car cause i havent been since last

gotta be ready for tomorrow again,anxiety1677,i realised this when i wa in hostel for  month that all  of the  friend i made there wa because of the help of my extroverted childhood friend i think this happens to lot of u introvert or people who are socially awkward,anxiety1678,i spend the next  hour overthinking everything i said and cringing even if it logically wasnt that weird  bad ill also think about all the thing i should have said or done it make me physically cringe to think about how do you make it stop,anxiety1679,doe it really do ya any good,anxiety1680, make eye contact nod in conversationnodding mean i understand it mean i am following what you are sayingeye contact is a distraction it make you focused on posing a certain way instead of listening and following the conversationboth nodding and eye contact are useful tool when you use them at the right time you have much le anxietyyou have to be able to communicate the basic of whats happening on your end and not lie about it thats the only way two people can connect simple thing like i am following or i am actually interested in this mean so much than you realise for anxiety wellness and connection when speaking but when you are lying about this your break the connection you are made a liar and a fake and you cant keep it up so you will experience anxiety,anxiety1681,im at a point now where i feel im able to push myself out of my comfort zone to overcome my fear but the thing is that i dont know what to do or say im ok with thing that have a script like ordering food because it preplanned but anything else is terribleim autistic so i guess im not great at reading the room and im often told that i seem quite emotionless closed off etc  so when i talk to people i think people are often under the impression that im mad at them or that im just kind of a boring personmy mom always tell me there load of people with similar interest a me that i could talk to but even then idk what to say the idea of going up to stranger being like hi do you like my weird obscure interest seems absurd ive tried online too and while i have one close internet friend every other conversation i make with anyone else just doesnt go anywhere and leaf me feeling silly for even tryingwhen people talk to me first i am often at a loss for word and if i do think of something to say it usually so awkward that my awkwardness rub off on the other person people usually talk to me once before leaving me alone because they realise im weird boring and awkward so not worth the effort when i wa at school teacher thought i wa trying to be too cool for everyone they have actually said this or that im uninterested in the class because i never got engaged with class discussion or made any friendsits just kinda sad idk what i want to achieve from making this post i guess just to complain a bit and maybe hear any advice or talk to people who feel a similar way,anxiety1682,for asking for help from my supervisor about my job counselor beneficiary i feel like he know too much now that he know why i decided to go i dont know how they could help me but i feel the advice ill recieve is only going to induce anxiety just by hearing and knowing what theyll be telling me to do im not so uncomfortable going there and meeting whoever just what theyll be telling me to do in order to help my anxiety i feel like turning down their advice already like another lousy depressed i dont want to ,anxiety1683,i have to go to a family event today and im having panic attack because theyre all so judgmental and none of them even give a fuck about me what if they ask about my friend i dont have friend  i dont even know who half of them are idk how to talk to them the only thing giving me peace is that i know there will be good food there,anxiety1684,a number of u did not grow up with the adequate social code which mean we very frequently but ourselves in situation where we are trying to say

anxiety going to work but know that outside social event will start to give me anxiety again i dont want to be just an awkward person and have them regret hanging out with me i tend to be really quite in group conversation but feel like i need exposure therapy to get out of my comfort zone however when i make plan i have horrible anxiety leading up to the event my stomach feel weird and uneasy and

having school spirit activity before on tuesday pm before we break for the holiday activity are thing like showing the kid a movie one teacher ha claimed this one playing video game with them baking cooky with them and i think a few morei also got sort of roped into being second chair of our student council the teacher in charge of student council ha made clear she expects all teacher to contribute something fair enough she ha repeatedly asked me what i plan to do but i just tell her ill do whatever is needed not a good answer i also have zero selfesteem and feel very worthless i am terrified of this event because i worry that no one will show up to my activity specifically because i am offering it this will confirm my inner narrative that i am worthless and unlovable i know i shouldnt care what my student think of me but the truth is they are the one i spend the most time with and know me best if they see me a worthless it just confirms to me that this is true we were all asked to start club for student with special interest i considered starting a wwii club but ultimately did not for the above reason so yeah i am stressed to the max about tuesday and just imagine people will avoid me like the plague because i am a worthless and unlovable fool,anxiety1705,im a loner and an extremeintrovert i completed high school a couple of year ago but now im too scared to

country,anxiety1707,tldr psilocybin mushroom helped me overcome my social anxietyi am a senior in college who ha struggled with anxiety for a while now ive never been the most social person in the world but when i got into college it really started making itself apparent that i wa kinda quiet and wouldnt say muchhowever being a college student it natural to put thought into self improvement and thing to do in order to put yourself back together againone thing that ha helped me on my path ha been the experimentation of psychedelic substance like lsd and psilocybin mushroomsjust the other day i ate three gram of psilocybin mushroom with a few friend and i can say with  certainty that it wa the best experience ive ever hadthe whole time my buddy and i were hanging out i didnt feel like i had to overthink what i wa about to say and instead just said what came to mind and it felt really good to just be myself and talk and share idea and beliefsive applied this mindset to my sober life and it only ha been a positive result sincei dont condone the reckless use of drug and i certainly dont condone the usage of thing like heroin or cocaine but if youre in your s and youre struggling with anxiety i highly suggest maybe researching microdosing and what psychedelics do to the braintheres a really good documentary on netflix called how to change your mind with michael pollan and it go over all the positive implication of psychedelics from a very educational and medical standpointjust thought id share,anxiety1708,i m afraid i ruined everything with someone because of my social anxiety congrat i feel so stupid and cant stop overthinking about it and now i cant sleep if only irl could have a reset button like in rpg game,anxiety1709,i dont know if this is the right sub for this and please direct me if it isnt my  year old son had a recital today he told me he wa a bit nervous he played very well  when he wa finished with his song he said mom look then showed me how much his hand were shaking   i felt horrible that he had so much anxiety about his performance he wa diagnosed with high functioning autism when he wa  through the school his dad and i never had him tested on our own since everything with  the school iep helped him significantly when he wa  they decided he didnt have autism but had high anxiety at the time they diagnosed him he wa doing well socially and had lot of friend  then covid happened and they had e learning instead of in class learning i feel this hurt him significantly he didnt keep in touch with friend and they didnt keep in touch with him either  they are basically the same introverted video game playing kid   it like they forgot how to socialize or didnt know how to outside of video game his dad and i have  shared physical and legal custody and have coparented well for over  year his stepmom is a nd mom to him and i appreciate that this bothered me though after it wa over we talked with his dad and step mom for awhile i brought up driver training since our son ha been very hesitant to take the class they both laughed and joked that he could take it next summer when his  year old step sister doe then maybe she could get him out of his shell and he could make friend wtf  they laughed and joked about it like he just need to suck it up a a mom this really bothered me this isnt just sucking it up it make him uncomfortable to be in a classroom of mostly stranger or probably kid who are just dick   i have been diagnosed with severe depression  gad adhd and ptsd adhd in the past year i didnt recognize his symptom because boy show it differently than girl do he come across a the most confident secure young man when he talk to me about life i didnt realize he wa masking it like i used to he seems more confident than i ever wa at his age   anyways i am rambling my heart hurt for him that he is dealing with this im making him an appointment with my mental health specialist monday she ha made a world of difference in my life the past year and i dont want my boy to feel even a fraction of what i have felt in my life i guess i feel guilty for not noticing this  but  i need to be his advocate i would never laugh at my son for not being a social a his stepsister that is just mean and cruel  i already know ill be thrown under the bus for taking him to see my provider but i dont care  and if they want to prescribe him medication or see a therapist that will help him im going to stand my ground he is under their insurance but if i have to ill put him under mine even though it super expensive i hate that he so uncomfortable and feel like that  i just want him to know life doesnt have to be filled with anxiety,anxiety1710,im pathetic ive let this sickness consume my life and destroy it ha

of the attorney brushed it off saying oh we get anxious sometimes too so despite getting the courage to share this among a room full of people it wasnt enough and ended up getting picked anyway though maybe sharing that my anxiety can lead to panic attack which ha happened to me enough time maybe would have helped but i didnt think about it at the timenow sitting in on the actual trial wasnt that bad since it wa nice and quiet the thing that got to me the most wa being around the other juror during break we have to wait in this small room and being there surrounded by very loud people that i have very little in common with wa absolute torture for me we werent allowed to bring our phone but i did bring a book but i couldnt focus on it because i wa experiencing sensory overload big time due to multiple people having different conversation at once about thing that held no interest to me it got to the point that i ended up having a breakdown when i went home after the second day because i wa just too damn overwhelmed and drained from being around all those people with little to no way to escape it and decompress it wa equivalent to being an a classroom in high school except these were full grown adult and not teenagersanyway it all over and done with now but i can only hope i wont have to do it again anytime soon or ever i think i might bring up the panic attack next time maybe that wa what i needed to say and it also suck because my workplace wa having a christmas party that i wa set on going to but i wa just too socially drained to go luckily my coworkers understood and

a mountain of expression sentiment sentence that i have to sift through to hopefully find something that is the correct puzzle piece to fit just right into the conversation and if i cant find one i ready myself for being exposed a an imposter for the few ppl i do manage to get comfortable enough with to let them peek past my careful mask literally one person rn and it dicey i still feel like im gonna step on a beartrap i get called quirky and weird in a more affectionate way for others even the mask isnt quite enough and i get called quirky and weird anyways so it really all for nothing and i know it all for nothing and i know they must be able to tell something isnt quite right which make the pressure way worse and so it go all this to say i live in constant fear that other ppl will find out im not like them and have no idea what is right to say or do and im just copying others with all these scattered anthropological notation in my head doe anyone relate and have the lock combo

work there anymore and wa talking to her and two other people that work there and said something about being stressed to which her coworker said you can just start drinking i said yeah one time i asked cara what she doe for selfcare and she said wine because i honestly thought she wa joking when she said thatanyways later on that day we were taking cara me and one more coworker who we are both close i said something about my anxiety she said the organization we work for should support u more because youre overthinking and my drinking ha gotten to be a lot i didnt know what to say i told her that i felt constantly like i might throw up because of the stress my plan is to advocate for more mental health support at work by writing a letter and joining a committee where i can bring up the need for more support but should i try to talk to her since i have my own social anxiety i keep feeling bad that i bought up what she had said and that i mentioned vomiting even though thats how i feel,anxiety1732,i just need to express this since it hitting me so har rn,anxiety1733,this is more directed to people from the uk how did you get help im nervous to use the nh a ive had multiple experience with them and none have been great but maybe i need to advocate for myself more it feel a though they dont actually help people not a dig at the worker a i know nh is in shamble also the

heelllp,anxiety1734,i would love to volunteer take different class such a fitness class etc i would really like to meet other people but i get so in my head i start thinking what if they are judging me what if they think there is something wrong with me what if i look awkward and then i get in my head about the way i say thing and the way i stand  then i start worrying about eye contact such a if i am creepy making eye contact and staring at them and then if i look away being concerned that i am being rude in term of volunteering i get worried that i will get lost and not know where to go that i will come across a rude antisocial and quiet i hate this,anxiety1735,cant even fucking see anything properly rn cause of the tear building up but im not even fucking sad at this point just completely infuriated,anxiety1736,removed,anxiety1737,i have been taking improv class since october to help me work on my sa and two day ago i went on stage with my group and played improvisation scene in front of a public of people i dont knowand some scene i did where not that bad and i heard some laughsi still cant believe i went through with this i never though i could do it me the fearful anxious guy i really had to force myself and wa even the first to volunteer for the first scenei have been working so hard it ha been so painful but it paying off i came a long wayit is possible people we can do it there is hope,anxiety1738,im so fucking done with this shit man all i want to do is to be able to have fun with my friend and to be able to socialize with them like a normal fucking person but no i cant even do that im just so god damn anxious around them and it to the point where even when we drink the alcohol doesnt even help anymore it just make me drown even deeper in my own thought and make me even more insecure about myself because i already cant function normally a a human when im sober so the alcohol just add to that it just so unfair i see other people my age hanging out in public with their friend all happy and talking and laughing and stuff but when im with my friend i just cant fit in or even hold a conversation with any of them because of this anxiety shit and it suck because ive been really close friend with these guy for year since we were in like grade school so youd think that i would be comfortable around them by now which i truly am on the inside but my anxiety just doesnt want to let me enjoy myself with others i guess it just so unfair i wish i could just get brain surgery or something on the part of my brain that isnt letting me be myself,anxiety1739,yesterday i f accidentally went to my company party i wanted to go to my bfs company party but his company is right next to mine and while i wa driving there my bos noticed me so ofc i had to go to my partythere i felt like it actually went quite well i had two glass of mulled wine and actually really talked to my team for the first time and they laughed about a lot of thing i said it wa fun usually im pretty much mute i thought i left a good impressionafter that i went to my bfs company s themed party i went there and  people were smoking around the fire and had drink my bf offered me a drink and i took it we went into the building and there were around ppl in a pretty small room there were light and music a couple people were playing beer pong lot of young people girl with crop top they had apparently had shot of jgermeister before my bfs bos wa dancing with some womanso maybe you get that i had the impression that drinking more wa ok at this party i also have never been at a company party before this day ive only been drinking for  year and because of my med that ive been taking for a month apparently alcohol hit stronger i wa also being kinda dumbsince it wa all a bit too much for me and my bf wanted to stay for a bit longer i drank more one shot jgermeister and one and a half beerslater  people join the party and ofc it people from my team theyre both around  my bf said i should dunno how to translate it shift down a few gear but i thought i wasnt acting that badso today i wake up and i feel kinda good i know i wa probably acting a bit awkward but the med have kicked in and i just dont give a fuckbut my bf wa pretty grumpy today and later tell me that most of the people at the party actually didnt have much to drink and i wa always getting louder and louder which i didnt notice and basically i wa making him look badwere both devs and trainee we dont have the kinda job where reputation is very important but im still fucking ashamed my coworkers that i work with every day and barely heard me talk before saw me i thought i left a nice impression before shortly after destroyed iti just wanna be normal i feel like maybe im just a fucking awkward person and my anxiety wa protecting me before,anxiety1740,my social anxiety is starting to really hold me back up until now it just stopped me from enjoying life to the fullest but now it starting to hurt my actual career a well i am a very good student academia is the one thing i dont doubt my ability in but im applying for internship and i struggle with the interview there are no leadership position on my cv because thats simply not me there are no example of me motivating or persuading others for me to give these interviewer when they ask for themdo i have to accept le for myself because i have this disorder or maybe im being lazy and cowardly and blaming it on a disorder that doesnt actually exist i dont think so other people dont feel the same terrible way i do in social situation theyre so so lucky i think feeling underappreciated and feeling like you deserve more is a common trait among people with social anxiety you see le competent morally worse people ending up with better prospect more friend more interesting life than you just because you struggle to talk to stranger it so sad and im a bit scared for my futuresometimes i dare to think about how ducking unstoppable i would be if i could just feel comfortable in the presence of people i dont know well how much better my life would be,anxiety1741,ive got a new job and ive met so many amazing people but none of them keep in contact with me i hate myself i wish i got closer to people i just never end up getting to properly know ppl i dont get it we have good fun when were together but i never have the deep convos with ppl the living is communal and i shared a room with a guy and another girl i thought me and the guy got on kinda well but we never had any deep chat and he got really close with  other girl in the house and i just feel so left out he left and he messaging everyone but me i sent him a message just saying best of luck and he just said thanks and that wa it i dont get why ppl never want to keep in contact with me my friend at home were so toxic so coming here and meeting genuine ppl i didnt know what to do i just regret not getting closer with ppl and now theyre gone and ill never talk to them again i just hate how i feel so empty that my roommate ha left and he not even thinking about me,anxiety1742,i cant help but feel like thats how people see me a a child who doesnt know any better im  twenty one and yet people are careful hesitant to be mean to me like yesterday at work i did something wrong and when my coworkers found out it wa me one said dont get mad at her it wasnt her fault in other word she didnt know any better like with a dog who ripped up some pillow the dog is excused cause they are just a dog and didnt know any better a child who cry cause they dont understand what they are feeling they are excused cause they dont know any better if it wasnt my fault then whose fault wa it did i just not know any better do they view me a mentally incapable is that the excuse thats where my thought go another time wa when i wa quitting my job my bos wa begging me to stay cause for some reason he enjoys my company not only a a worker but also a person i kept declining another coworker who wa younger then me told me not to let my bos pressure me into staying a if he needed to tell me cause he believed i wa easily persuaded into doing thing i didnt want to do i know im overreacting and thinking too much but i cant help it i cant help but believe thats how people see me a stupid and need others to go easy on me all because im timid and cause of sa dealing with sa ha me appear in such a way that it give others the wrong impressionthat im a child who need to be treated differently doe anyone else feel like this a helpless child,anxiety1743,i dont have many friend so i really appreciate the one i do have however sometimes i just cant help but feel horribly envious of them when they tell me story about randomly being approached by otherseven worse is when we are somewhere together and a person ive been seeing around and i really like start talking to those friend not me never me no one ever approach me they exchange social friend get compliment about their style friend is happy about it but they dont seem to have much of an interest in those people and i watch it silently just standing next to them screaming inside hey look at me i like your hair so much i heard you talking about a topic i am very interested in i probably look aloof i probably look uninterested or other time i laugh and act really obnoxious and loud and awkward but somehow still trying to pretend that i dont care they arent interested in me i dont think i am actually unlikable i have good quality i think i am smart and i believe i am kind my self esteem is getting a lot better and honestly so doe my anxiety so do my social skill yet i still never get approached and those people will never know how much i wanted to talk to them how many scenario i made up about talking to them they will live their life and wont even know my name if i ever come up i will be friend friend me though i will think a lot about them a missed opportunity i genuinely think we could get along if not for my anxiety and this is somehow the worst about this allthat i do not think i am unlikable and because i do not think i am unlikable i dont know why no one seems to well like me that much or find me interesting enough to start a conversation having a good self esteem and social anxiety feel like your brain constantly arguing with itself,anxiety1744,everything is incredibly complex when you analyse it and im supposed to stand up for my opinion a if theyre correct if someone tell me im doing something wrong i believe them i do a lot of shit wrong all the time so when people tell me to just be myself and be strong and dont give a fuck about what others say it demanding an unrealistic level of faith i have in my own judgement im so insecure because time and time again ive proved myself to be untrustworthy and basically fucking thick,anxiety1745,my family are having old friend over for dinner ughhh that small part where i have to walk into the kitchen and say hello to everyone is scary i have to smile i have to present myself and show myself off even for a few moment i have to show some warmth to people i dont really think about ever also when they ask me question about what ive been up to and i know they are internally judging me ighhhhh the mum especially is scary because shes no nonsense and ha the capacity to call people out for stuff plus my dad is so insecure but also loud af and will be running around trying to make people laugh perhaps at my expense just generally being a very annoying person i hate this shit,anxiety1746,i am trying to get rid of my social anxiety but a lot of advice i come across seems to be for people who have a high level of anxiety when they first meet someone that decrease a they get to know someone and get comfortable and open up slowly i seem to be the opposite when i first meet someone i can fake not having social anxiety i can ask them basic get to know you question and control my body so that it outwardly appears that my stomach on the inside isnt flipping out so badly which it is anyways a i have more and more interaction with a person i get le comfortable and not more a time go on i lose my ability to even fake not having social anxiety and i become more and more quiet and anxiousis anyone else like this how do i stop this it feel like i slowly ruin every potential friendship with how my social anxiety increase with continued interaction,anxiety1747,mg capsule with my daily cup of coffee and magnesiumzinc tablet ive been taking it for  week i had to interact with people at a shop yesterday and a neighbor today that i usually avoid anxiety absolutely gone i wa able to talk to each of these people about really trivial thing and actually enjoy small talk i usually suffer from heavy procrastination avoidance chest tightness intrusive thought physical tenseness sweating staying home stuttering brain blankness trouble looking people in the eye you name it i will say i wa once outgoing and enjoyed chatting i lost my way amp self esteem somewhere down the line for about  yr this is the first time i feel like myself and feel interested socially rather than defensive and scaredhappy to answer any questionsmy disclaimer is please research and the routine that work for you if youre interested and want to try rnootropics and rsupplements have been hugely helpful to me a well a youtube video review of ltheanine and google searching all the info possible,anxiety1748,i dont have gfs right now to go out to eat with and im not close with my family so i usually go out to eat alone if my boyfriend is at work and im at chipotle right now and i actually wanna cry because i literally have so much anxiety i know people are not paying attention to me but my brain is making me think i look dumb right now eating alone i literally started cry and walked out to my car and eating in my car now even tho i hate eating in my car  lmao i hate my self sometimes,anxiety1749,recently my sa ha gotten exponentially worse to a point where when im sitting in a group and for example am introduced to new people by my friend i completely zone out to inside my head and stay silent the whole time i sometimes force myself to say something but i cant even think of what i want to say because of the negative thought in my head so usually something stupid come out when i do say it this all started recently most likely because of a depressive episode ive had i know that the people im with look at me weird but have no idea how to react even when im silent they just look at me and i dont know what to say so i look away i feel really awkward and im sure they do to when interacting with me how can i explain to my friend that im going through this i live in a country where mental health isnt talked about or known about so when i try explain they most likely dont take me seriously this is all going towards me losing everyone and being known a a weirdo for the rest of my life any help would be greatly appreciated,anxiety1750,i wa about to go out with my dog so i already put on my earbuds and wa listening to music while grabbing my boot i started to widen them so i can easily slide in but it took time and time this stressed me out so much although i usually dont have social anxiety around my parent but then this cold shiver hit me i struggeled so much putting on these damn boot i even made it worse by pulling out a shoelacei thought about what they might think of me i really cant do anything not even tying shoe normally,anxiety1751,hey im a f and for the last few week ive really been wondering if it actually might be better to just let my anxietypanic attack happenwhen ive talked to my doctor or a therapist about it theyve always just said that it a good thing but ive obviously never really told them how it feel when trying to fight it eg for about month ago i were for a whole weekend in a very socially demanding situation with hundred of stranger and like  i knew from school but didnt talk to that whole weekend i basically just focused on not having an anxiety attack but instead my anxiety level just stayed right on the edge for hour meaning it wa all i thought about instead i couldve tried to find a bathroom and get some of the worst anxiety out of me like that i probably wouldve had quite a few anxiety attack during the weekend but at least i wouldnt have felt like dying a muchsry if got a bit long but what would you do and do you think would help me most in the long run,anxiety1752,im in a friend group of  people and have been for year now that were older we see each other le but we have a group chat and one of them said we should buy ticket for this event and i did but i feel like they dont want me to go there with them im afraid ill be a downer or just annoying very often im so scared they want me out and im not sure whether it anxiety or they just hate me  when i ask them i know theyd say im welcome because they have to right should i just act like i dont feel this way because of the selffulfilling prophecy,anxiety1753,my family went on a rant about mental illness not being real my boyfriend say he doesnt understand how people so unimportant could have such an effect on me which is kind of the whole point isnt it im just really struggling and it feel like no one understands am i destined to just go about life misunderstood,anxiety1754,it a huge stadion and i go alone but im so excited and now i dont worry about the huge crowd i just want to see the bandit gonna be a huge experience for me,anxiety1755,so background  i wasnt interested in making friend for the first  year of my life but during covid i had felt socially starved for human connection so now im  and have made many more friend despite my social anxiety but im having some problem with certain thing mainlythe fact that i have struggled to hang out with my friend outside the school but i started doing that a few week ago where i went out to play football with some friend from my class and despite that fact that i dont even like football i still had fun i also invited  friend to my house to play video game and we had funbut here the thing everytime i see my friend hang out without me i get extremely upset because it make me feel like they dont care about me and that im pointless and meaninglesslike today when i looked at the instagram story of one of my friend and found that they had hung out without me i quickly got hit with a strong wave of emotion and thought like they dont care about you because they never even notice or think about you and you are meaningless and pointless and will never get to hang out with them again started racing in my head i texted one of my friend about it and he told me that the reason why i wasnt invited is because the person who invited them to his house wa someone i didnt know so he didnt invite me cuz he doesnt know me lol and my friend told me that he would have invited me if he couldso yeah even after that i felt extreme upset it like i wanna hang out with them more i wanna be there in every hang out i wanna be there in every picture i wanna be texted first i wanna be invited morei just need a way to stop or process these heavy trigger like emotion that come everytime i see or hear about my friend hanging out i tried muting their instagram story since thats where they post pic of them hanging out but i keep getting curious to what theyre doing and i open the story anyway and i get triggered againi just felt starved for so long and now i finally have something and i love it so much a bit too much even,anxiety1756,best product and service,anxiety1757,me and a person i dont talk to very much both wanted to speak to eachother it wa mutal and we talked for about min and we were both done we said all we wanted to say so mutually we both wanted to part way but of course neither of u knew how to end it without being abrupt rude or disrecpctful anyways we kind of crossed back over with what we have already spoken about just because we didnt know how to part way then i just ended it because i thought i would want to avoid him in the future if i continue to betray myself now by not ending it so i just randomly said well i better get back to it and left,anxiety1758,hello i am almost m and my longest job wa about a week i most certainly have social anxiety and apparently a judgement phobia which wa told to me by my therapist well now i just ignore my therapist call and havent put out

a girl stuff during a student film my coworker asked me to helpout i came in and shortly after wa paralyzed with fear and dissociated i froze up i noticed they kept lifting this girl dress up and it wa completely accepted i wa puzzled later i found out people were saying i wa checking her out and being disgusting i am appalled i saw what wa happening and looked away i didnt realize until later they were adjusting a mic but it made me look incredibly creepy i do not know how to handle this im a young woman and wa just nervous and didnt realize what wa happening now im stuck with this another group ha accused me of being a stalker because i ended up in the same place a some popular chick multiple time even though we go to the same school people have got this horrible idea about me now because im quiet and awkward and observe and panic and it blown way out of proportion i do not know what to do because i genuinely never had either bad intention im mortified and do not know how to resolve this,anxiety1760,it my friday social event in a line time and i feel like im creating fake screenshots in my head my he like her more is attracted to her more im just eh i could have a cv

everything make more logical sense,anxiety1761, i hate when ppl say they have no irl friend ik that might be how they feel so i cant entirely blame them but ive had friend online b who say the same shit to try and relate to me or maybi they just felt like that but it so frustrating they dont know what it really like to have zero irl friend idgaf if they say oh but we arent that close ok maybe u arent besties with ppl irl but the second you start messaging irls and hanging out youre friend im not trying to gatekeep having no friend cause thats some dumb tiktok twitter shit but it feel almost demeaning when everyone is like yeah i dont have any friend irl either dont worry because it make me feel bad for caring at all oh everyones like that ok well ig ill just km then since my issue everyone ha and can deal with fine or if they say they arent dealing with it it the same shit because the next day they come with some story about going out with friend irl and i feel like ive just

prime and now i just have to go through the last spurt of life im not suicidal or anything i just feel like there nothing to look forward too you knowlogically i know that  is quite young the beginning of my life blah blah blah but i just agree a though ill turn from a kid who probably need therapy to that one weird person you meet sometimes there hasnt really been anything that make me happy i try to get out of my comfort zone like last summer i worked at mcdonalds for a month but i just couldnt fake socialness and whatever so i ended up quitting after a monthits just that no matter what i do i cant connect with people which just make me feel sad c i just want to be a normal girl tbh i dont care about if im rich or poor in the future i just want friend but even when all the opportunity are given to me i simply cant,anxiety1764,im so nervous for when i turn  i have mo clue what im going to do only job ive ever had wa literally working once a week and then i tried  day a week and couldnt even do that i would literally cry so hard id puke because i wa so scared and i wa literally just a bussersemi waitress idk what im supposed to do i wabt to go to college and stuff but i doubt itll happen ik it sound really wrong and maybe misogynistic but my only hope is finding a husband or something or else ill be forced onto the street but how am i supposed to do that when my anxiety is literally crippling idk what to do everyone tell me to grow out of it but it wont go away im so scared itll still be here when u turn  in  idk what to do anymore it like im just waiting for my life to end it terrifying,anxiety1765,had a normal day and nothing important happened but tomorrow i will be doing something for the first time that ha a me a little nervous,anxiety1766,people say that if you practice putting yourself out there it will get easier to do it i really really push myself to be social at work to make conversation with people to go on date group event solo travel etc i feel horribly judged at work in my apt building we have no sound proofing in my town i know that i come across a awkward and people tell me im weird and a downer i try very very hard to to be but it seems like cant help it  it just my nature i try not to care that people tell me im weird awkward or uncomfortable but it really eats at me im often worried that people are just barely tolerating me or humoring me out of politeness a small number of people gossip about my mental health and ibtry to ignore itbut it make it hardi dont have many close friend or a partner and at  i think it show people in my small town say im a bit of an oddball i wake up out of a dead sleep filled with dread and social panic every night honestly no matter how much i put myself out there i feel incredibly insecure im losing  or  hour of sleep a night and it starting to show i feel like im trying so hard to maintain my reputation and it killing me,anxiety1767,everytime i make plan it induces major anxiety even with friend who are relaxed my brain equates it to that of a job interview or something this especially happens when im meeting up with people i havent seen in a long time how do you calm yourself down so they the inside of your body isnt freaking out in anticipationif you think this sound bad with friend imagine how awful and impossible it is when it come to dating i hardly get involved with anything romantic but when i do i hate date hate hate hate them,anxiety1768,so i have high functioning social anxiety i get hella nervous in crowded place but can talk to people if they make the effort anyways i actually like being alone it feel peaceful and you dont gotta deal with other people b ive been belittled and neglected all my life by friend and family people always went out of their way to find the smallest flaw in me whether it something i said or did and they never took me serious cause im a walking twig and quiet in general which is why im the way i am now i do wish i had a gf to have some type of support but in the end im fine with being on my own at this point dont know if ive become accustom to this or if im going insane mentally anybody else feel this way,anxiety1769,yeah fuck you all,anxiety1770,i think the thing that fuck me up the most is the overthinking my brain doe every time i leave a social setting like today i went to a white elephant office party i only started working here two month ago so to me it wa really important that i make a good impression and socialize because i really want to meet people and make new friend i didnt talk much but i think i did alright i took super long opening my gift tho and everyone wa starting at me i just couldnt figure out how to untie the string at the top and it wa embarrassing so now im laying in bed and my chest feel so fucking tighti also said thing that i wish had been funnier and not a embarrassing it just feel like ive made a complete idiot out of myself but i cant tell if it the anxiety or im just super awkward but i feel like this every time i leave a social event  i feel like i need help,anxiety1771,f here i have never been in a date in my life since sa make it really difficult for me to feel comfortable around guy i also tend to like really shy guy so waiting for them to make a move is rarely an option advice would be appreciated and no i cant just approach dude confidently cause im a girl and i can get anyone i want thats a lie and sa take point off that too trust me,anxiety1772,tldr pretty sure i got ghosted by someone i felt i wa connecting with last heard bad shit going on pulling back from people again wondering if overreacting or notas the title say im pretty sure i got ghosted by the first person i felt i mightve been making a connection with in over  year i fell hard into my sa and depression back then after mistake i made before all this now tho i wa starting to break through it when we started talking it wa so easyi wasnt even thinking about it for me that doesnt happen at all and it felt like she wa looking at and talking to me not looking at the job or clothes or moneybut at the person and she seemed so kind genuine and sincerei feel like an asshole thinking she ghosted me last i heard she watched one her coworkers get beat by the coworkers boyfriend even tho i feel i mightve been ghosted from what i last heard im worried because of shit ive seen in the past and idk what to feel but now i feel like im on the edge of fence on one side being a complete reclusesafe sound and alone and on the other side being the nice caring outgoing person my friend and family see the person i want to bethis whole thing ha got my pulling back from people again this time im trying to fight it instead of giving into it but it not going great im pretty sure im overreactingtheres lot of shit that can go on in life and if i am ghosted im pretty sure ill be ok in the long run but it the combination of hurt worry and a hint of anger thats driving me up a wall and drove me here am i over thinking and do yall think i got ghosted and are these complicated feeling normal,anxiety1773,im genuinely wondering idk whats wrong with me a a girl i feel like it should be easy to make friend but i just feel so trapped idk it like every time i think about talking to someone i think like they probably already have a bad opinion of me since i dont talk why start now i cant start a conversation in class it my senior year now and while ive had friend on and off i havent really been able to keep any i just never got close to them i have only made friend with people who approach me first but the only people who approach me first are just guy who try hitting on me idek man im so tired of being alone online i can talk to people so easily and i feel like my real personality show online but in person i just shut down,anxiety1774,idk where to start but im just having more breakdown consistently now and i have no one to vent to so i appreciate if anyone take time to readsince high school making friend and socializing ha been my fucking kryptonite ive seemed to only pick up acquaintance since then and it hurt me so much im someone who really care about people and try to go above and beyond for them by helping out and caring for them i try to make myself available whenever someone need me and even if i am attending to something i try my best to be there because i truly care it hurt so much to see these effort and kindness be taken for stupidity while im ignored afterwards and not even given a simple thank you it a if life really just gave me a pile of dogshit human being and put them in my life just to destroy my mental health on my birthday i cant even get a simple happy birthday or maybe even some sort of recognition or anything i just feel like cry everyday now because i always see everyone so happy and kind to each other in their own group and i only dream to be part of one idk it wa

grandparent,anxiety1790,im currently a sophomore at university and since coming back home ive realized that over the past two year ive let my anxiety control me i find it hard to make and keep friend in general sometimes i dont vibe with the other person and dont make an effort to hang out other time when i really like talking to someone i realize the enthusiasm isnt exactly reciprocated i think my combination of anxiety and depression ha just resulted in me becoming a very boring and dull person even with my boyfriend and best friend i find it hard to hold conversation for more than  minute without an awkward silence i know that they probably arent this way with other people and it discourages me even more from reaching out and talking to them since college started i had a very idealistic view on how thing would play out but i feel like i played the card dealt to me wrong next semester i plan on rushing a business frat that my boyfriend is already in so i could try to make some longlasting connection however i cannot stop thinking about how boring they would find me or how they wont like me i know im just overthinking but it feel impossible to foster any confidencedoes anyone have any tip to cope with anxiety and poor self esteem in college,anxiety1791,ive worked in retail for over a year now started not long after graduating college and it been so frustrating to try to overcome the worst symptom of my social anxiety i cant count how many time ive been helping a customer and then my mind just go blank blank or i run out of thing to say and awkwardly migrate away i thought that eventually it would get easier to talk to stranger but it seems like there is some part of my brain that just put me in a state of tension a soon a i begin interacting with someone im in therapy and have tried different medication but havent seen much improvement,anxiety1792,i have been playing the oboe in my town philharmonic for the last  year im m and every year we usually do a christmas dinner and this year we have secret santa now i have  option either i do not buy a gift and do not participate at all in the secret santa but that may be looked a bit down upon by others or if i choose to buy a gift i receive one a well now there is the problem i would have to go to the front of everyone around  people and receive a gift i know that i will be anxious alcohol may help but i want to stay away from it should i try and put myself in an anxious situation to analyse it or should i just stay off and do not participate at allmy mind tell me not to do it because it is safer but then it would also be looked down upon therefore being judged by others what would you do,anxiety1793,my post are usually one giant paragraph so dont count me out if it seems overwhelming lolso a few day ago my therapist and i were trying to figure out way that i could get out and put myself in situation where i might meet new people and she brought up going to a restaurant alone now a someone with social anxiety that sound terrifying but ive given it some thought and i kinda like the idea lately ive been doing small thing to overcome anxiety for example giving the wrong name to the lady at the cash register at a restaurant calling someone the wrong name just to get their reaction knocking a bag of chip off the shelf at a grocery store etc and it scary at first but once i do it i feel a little more confident than i did before and so the going to a restaurant alone idea ha given me some motivation to accomplish another situation that cause anxiety the only thing is is that this would be very anxiety inducing for me the social anxiety in me would constantly think that people are watching and judging me and i know that people probably wouldnt actually be judging me and so what if they were but im just hesitant im not sure if anyone else ha done this before but if you have did you meet people there and or make any friend because thats my main reason for wanting to do it ill just be honest i get extremely lonely on the weekend and experience fomo and i feel like i desperately need to get out and make friend because im quite depressed i just dont want to be told that i shouldnt do it if im desperate because i need social interaction like it kill me to be lonely constantly my therapist say that social interaction is right up there with survival need like food and water and honestly i can see why so if anyone would be willing to give me some advice id appreciate it thanks,anxiety1794,at my job everyone in my department wa older than me until we hired someone else my age he ended up befriending basically everyone else but me im stand offish so i understand why he didnt care to socialize with me but i felt

conversation and we had more in common than i thought if ekt guilt y befriending him right before he leavestoday wa his last day i went to his desk to say bye and shook his hand i made it quick

conversation shook hand and hugged i almost choked up i need to stop assuming the worst about people and learn to be open i always wait to be approached but never approach first i realize this wont

their eye because i find it unbearably overwhelming people always seem to be bored and irritated by my presence and always gravitate towards others while im around i feel like it possibly because i

i used to live with my parent until  and they were the only people i see apart from few friend that i met once or twice in a year i am now  and for the last  year i live in another city and i am completely alone only seeing people at the office  day a week and meeting with my childhood friend again once or twice in a year  relationship in my whole life my first kiss came  month ago in an absurd way which i posted here still virgin and i have social anxiety i really hate meeting new people finding something to talk with new people is one of the biggest challenge for me with my close friend i am the most talkative and funny guy but with new people i am all quietanyway a briefly mentioned above i had a brief interaction with a girl and due to my inexperience social anxiety and general stupidity i mess everything up and even though she wa the one approaching me i failed to have a relationship i wa basically like a plant for the last  month nothing gave me joy i just walked long hour a staying at home made me feel depressed and i could not concentrate into anythingnow i am still not that good and think about this girl almost all the time but i feel much better because i came to a realization when i wa reading a sort of sad tweet about how we are all lonely and we might die alone after the event with this girl i used to start cry after reading such sad stuff but that time i just thought i cant be sad about this all the time even if i will be alone my whole life and could possibly die alone a a virgin it is not the end of the world after saying this to myself i suddenly felt proud of me to ignore such sad stuff after a highly sensitive periodand this thought brought me back to life partly it is closer to a religious thought like god is testing you with something such a sickness disability or unemployment etc it is your test and you must bear with it i do not have any religion so i do not believe that test stuff but personally i would also like to note that i am not advising anything a this is highly subjectivebut when i thought my finance could be considered a great thanks to my parent and i have never seen poverty i have no known health issue and i am trying to lose weight i have a house and a car i managed to visit and study abroad i have a job with a great income i finished law school and did master and i am able to survive by myself one way or the other since so much could have gone worse for me in the life i am ready to accept social anxiety and loneliness a my destiny and live my whole alone if loneliness is written for me in the future so be iti know this sound depressing and like giving up trying to change for the better and i agree this is submissive but still this though made me the happiest in the last two month and i can function a before,anxiety1803,i m have noone i can tell without embarrassing myself i hope here someone understands me because today i had a presentation at uni and i had to talk for only five

situation i would try to tear my skin off with my fingernail until i bled and even then sometimes that wasnt enough for me i also due this due to generalized anxiety disorder along with my ocd too though a majority of the time it because of my social anxiety disorder i still have some scarring from when i tried to tear offscratch off my skin during an argument with my dad sometimes i pick at the spot when im feeling anxious honestly sometimes i contemplate growing my nail out again so id have an easier time trying to rip open my skin the next time i feel anxious,anxiety1824,for the past  year ive pretty much been living a a hermit i go out with friend sometimes and talk to friend regularly on playstation but aside from that i dont leave my house at all working from home hasnt helped me in this situation either ive always had social anxiety but it definitely been made worse in these past couple yearsanyways ive been feeling a lot more lonely than usual recently and decided to download tinder just for the fun of it and see what my option are to my surprise ive gotten over  like and a decent amount of match with some pretty girl in the few day ive been on there while i wa ecstatic at first the euphoria i got from that sudden influx of validation quickly turned into dread see ive never been in a relationship in my life before and havent spoken to many girl in general ive been on one date in my entire life and it wa in  when me and a girl got got a meal after school to be honest i wouldnt say im good at talking to other guy either ive had the same group of friend since elementaryhigh school and have trouble making new friend back to tinder everything feel so overwhelming my heart race just sending a simple message and i take an hour minimum to reply back to a message with that said since were over text im still able to have playful fun conversation and have gotten a few number telling them well make plan soonwhat these girl dont know is that theyre actually texting a completely socially inept guy that barely leaf his house i wouldnt even know where to take someone out on a date i dont know any barsrestaurants since i dont go out and i could already picture the look of disappointment on their face upon meeting them when they realize i cant hold a conversation because of my intense anxiety this whole experience ha made me realize just how behind i am socially especially within people in my age group just turned  i want to be in a relationship or at least have a little physical intimacy in my life if anyone ha some dating tip feel free to tell meevery small thing feel like it on hard mode,anxiety1825,basically im in this sort of girl club at my school it really a reading club and ive been in it since last year there only a small number of girl probably only about  i initially joined last year because i wa excited about the new chance of possibly making friend for once and getting out the house after school and instead doing something productive rather than sitting around moping that i barely have a social life but ive always felt left out it made it worse that almost everybody there knew everybody there wa a girl that i used to be friend with there and she wa also friend with everybody else we ended thing on a bad note so it would be awkward even if i tried to befriend any of them there is this one girl who share the same interest a me but for the past year that weve been sitting beside each other weve never spoken a word to each other so i gave up on that even when we have ice breaker and i try to put myself out there it never seems to be of any benefit to me i sit at the end of the table and everybody pretend i dont exist nobody talk to me nobody acknowledges me knowing them since last year ive never connected with any of themand since winter break start tomorrow last week the person in charge of the club my teacher from last year decided that it would be fun if we did a secret sister thing where we get a name of one of the girl and we have to get them a present it can be bought made or something youve never used and im gonna be honest i felt salty about it why would i give a gift to these ppl that are supposed to be my sister but they pretend a if i barely even exist everytime i leave a meeting i feel so horrible one time i nearly even cried whats the point of being in this girl club if i dont ever feel like im actually apart of it i didnt go to the meeting yesterday because i cried that night and i wasnt in the mental state to go to school so i stayed home my teacher asked me today to drop by her room to pick up the gift my secret sister gave me i went because i didnt want to be insensitive i got the gift and went to my next class honestly it not a great gift but thats not what im worried about i had the urge to just throw it away because in the end it just them being fake only reason the girl gave me a gift is because she pretty much had too shes one of the reason why i stopped going to the club since  week ago and why i feel so outcasted but i wanted to know other people opinion on this because i feel like this why would i accept a gift from people who pretend i barely exist unless they have to they only acknowledge me when they have to they only speak to me when they have to other than that i sit in silence the entire  hour that we spend sitting at that table,anxiety1826,i mean i feel so anxious and scared to talk to anyone so uncomfartable around people i think im really weird because of it and wish i had never been

fountainhead by ayn rand     the book arent so that you actually do manipulate people just so that you can feel like youre able to keep some control in social situation you dont want to give the social power to someone else you want to be in control of yourself and not change to their preference looking stupid in public    like the art critic example looking intentionally stupid in public in such a way that everyone know youre intending to look stupid and then owning it act like an entertainer a celebrity wave smile react to their reaction to you mantra    you dont own me for me at least

overall the sound or the vibe i give when i talk might come across le agreeable or smooth than the more socially adept i dont feel that way in my native language over the past year ive tried to learn the american nicety so that i could feel le intimated awkward or foreign in social interaction it did work to some degree id pick a warmer tone use the most common friendly filler and i could hold up small talk and even make a few joke here and there though im still bad at keeping up the conversation with people im not close with but when i overhear people at a local cafe chatting with the staff who are super friendly and chat people up i feel im not a warm or smooth i do chit chat with the staff too when i speak although i smile and consider myself having a pretty sweet and soft voice there a certain degree of selfrestrain and tension in my voice a nervousness polite but not totally open  relaxed  it feel like id display nicety but keep people at arm length or trying to run away from the situation whereas the people at the cafe seem to genuinely enjoy the small talk it seems theyre really happy talking with the staff theyd also say bye when they leave but i wouldnt go out of my way to do that i dont feel familiar with the staff enough now i dont think every cafe is like thisand maybe those people are regular whore already friend with the staff but it must be really nice to be able to enjoy small talk a they dowhich made me feel like a gloomy misanthrope when i couldnt summon the courage to walk up to the counter and exchange a good bye so im thinking of adjusting my speaking manner again to sound more approachablei do want to make more friend is this a good idea or am i just working on the superficial level like ive known non native speaker who are just warm by nature no matter how they sound english speaker do you immediately feel more drawn to someone if they have a more bubbly way of talking,anxiety1870,the apple storegrowing up kid in middle school and high school would go to the apple store to take picture and post them on social medium my mind automatically labeled the apple store a a place for cool people and i wasnt cool enough to ever go inside i

family of about six very tall blonde guy and a couple of them looked in my direction which made me feel a little anxious and out of place but i kept my focus on looking for the exact item that i wanted to see on display once i found it i felt okay i picked up the phone so i could get a feel for how it work and felt anxious for approximately  more second wondering if anybody wa looking over my shoulder and judging me for randomly playing with the phone but once i told myself that the purpose of the phone to be on display is for new customer to play with them then my anxiety went away once i made my decision i left the store and felt just finei also noticed that not one time did my heart start racing i wa mentally anxious but not physically anxious i dont know if this is a sign of me

protect ourselves from physical danger imagine you were hunting and then a tiger would appear our brain would trigger the fight or flight response so that we would not be shocked and do nothing about it it released adrenalin into our blood so our bpm got higher ready for a fight or to flea away to safety in modern time we can still see this happening but in situation where we are not really in danger like seeing a dog in the street and you start to get nervous afraid it will bite younow ga is a system that protects u from physical harm but a we developed a human we started civilazations we socialised more and all of the sudden our social status started being important for our successmy theory is that social phobia which is the fear of being judged by other people is an evolution of generalised anxiety to protect our social status if you analyse every situation where you were anxious around other people you will find that deep down the root fear that you have is being judged by others and the mechanism that ganxiety used to protect u from physical threat is being used to protect u from social threatidk that is my theory,anxiety1875,im so embarrassed to go to an ahl hockey

then i turned around and stood still all of a sudden i hear boy in black i wa dressed in black but i wasnt sure then i hear them getting closer behind my back and i felt they were scared or

compatible ill eventually find something we ca relate to or that im genuinely interested in and let it drive the conversation im nowhere near the best but ive improved a lot throughout the year so im fine with it but when it come to talking to  or more people at oncethe more people the worse it is i completely shut down and stay quiet look down in shame at any millisecond of awkward silence and i can also tell there a decline in the way i communicate ill say something late asf bc im so nervous and people just skip it like if i said nothing and continue talking and before you place the blame on them i came up with something completely out of topic while someone wa telling a story or saying something long this isnt the first time it happens but why doe my brain go ape mode when it more than  person im talking to i automatically go on defense and become more thick skinned and boring a a way to avoid public humiliation maybe it related to the fact that the chance of being judged and it having a negative effect on the way youre perceived is higher in a group because it more people to do it it also incredibly hard to go off of everyones pace and fit my comment or say any insightful thing doe this happen to anyone else and if youve had any success pulling yourself out what did you do,anxiety1889,removed,anxiety1890,after school i nb went to the library to sit so i can wait

which say could be a  chance of actually having autism this is the first time i feel like this might be right and dont feel bad or wrong with this im trying to find someone for a real test and diagnosis now which is hard you have to wait y in germany or pay a shit ton of money that i do not have anyone else ever wondered if it not sa in their case since i got told i have sa in  i always thought okay my weird behaviour ha to be because im scared it wa my goto explaination for being weird but now after reading a lot about it and learning thing and even asking a friend that got autism about how she see thing and stuff i feel a lot better with thinking maybe im not wrong maybe im just the way i am i never rly liked people and tried to have a lot around me when i wa a kid i had like  friend and that wa enough for me when they moved further away and we couldnt hang out anymore it did suck but it wasnt like i felt the need to get new people it super exhausting for me to be around people well anyways now my current therapist say i cant have autism i would mask too good a info im a woman and a i learned this week after all the reasearch is that it doe get diagnosed a lot le for woman than for men due to having other behaviour and masking a different way im sorry for the long as post i just kinda had to get this off my chest and maybe even get to read some other people opinion on this and how they see thing for themself,anxiety1922,ive had social anxiety my entire life m i dont think i even realized how severe it wa until it finally disappeared but more on that later ive also experienced lifelong depression but i think it wa mostly an effect of the anxiety having limited my life in so many waysabout a month ago i decided to try ketamine therapy i had been thinking about it for year ever since article about it effect on depression started being widely publicized i signed up with mindbloom mainly because it would allow me to take the drug in my own home the article i read said that most people experience an immediate improvement in their depression symptom this wa also said to me during my zoom consultation with mindbloomthe ketamine session itself wa unremarkable i did not feel any of the dissociative effect that i wa told would probably occur after about an hour i experienced significant anxiety which lasted for  hour not panic attack level but level that i havent felt in many year i dont really remember the next transition but at some point i fell into a deep depression which lasted over two week i could not stop ruminating i didnt leave the house for a week and barely left my bed i hardly ate the depression wa severe enough to include suicidal ideation which i had not experienced in almost  year i should have sought help at this point but i didnt also many memory that i had long ago suppressed popped back into my head which wa scary and gave me even more thing to ruminate onsometime in the third week i started climbing out of the pit i spent le but still significant time ruminating i went for a short walk outside the house i took a shower by the start of week four i felt about the same a before the ketamine which is to say not great but at least functional at this point i had another zoom call with mindbloom and told them what happened they said it wa rare but doe happen in people with untreated trauma which certainly applies in my case they said that i should go to therapy and to consider proceeding with the additional ketamine session in the future because it could still be beneficial i wa surprised they would say this given how bad my experience had beenhalfway through week  i started feeling a small amount of mania i wa energized and hyper i met a friend for tea and wa talking very fast the entire time i recognized that i must be experiencing mania which i have actually enjoyed a few time in the past a a reprieve from my usual depression i decided to go out for dinner at a neighborhood bar i said hi to an older couple seated next to me and ended up having a long and fun conversation with them i went home and slept i assumed the mania would increase and last a few day a it had in the pastbut it did not i woke up feeling calm i went for a walk and at some point realized i wasnt walking with my head down i went to get a cup of a tea at a cafe and when placing my order i made eye contact with the cashier i smiled i spoke my order clearly and more loudly than usual when they asked for my name to put on the cup i said it without the usual question mark at the end i didnt feel nauseous i wasnt sweating my hand werent in my pocket i wasnt looking at the ground i started getting very excited i went to get a haircut and conversed with my hair dresser throughout the entire cut feeling a sort of high at this point i walked to a clothing store normally i mumble just browsing to the salesperson this time i said i am looking for a jacket for weather like today and then i turned down  different option they showed me before finding one i liked normally i would have felt pressure to buy something i didnt like or would have left prematurely just to escape the anxiety i wont belabor the point further but suffice to say my social anxiety wa effectively gone at least for everyday low risk interactionsit ha only been a few day since the day i described above im keeping a close eye on my anxiety i think it may be coming back a bit but im not sure im going to try and see a therapist asap i hope they can give me a plan of action to hold on to my newly rewired brain im very curious to try some higher stress social interaction such a a date or group setting i feel like i just got out of prison after  year at a logical level i am furious that i discovered this treatment so late in life but i dont feel angry i actually feel what i think is hope which is a very strange feeling,anxiety1923,i already suffer from social anxiety recently i told my friend about my problem now shes telling everyone i just found out shes a fake friend because of her i cant keep studying because im depressed asf with everything going on with my life i cant take it anymorewhat

me normally unless the other person say something first i would just pretend that i didnt see them but for some reason i had the urge to call out to them ive literally never done this before i had to say their name several time before they noticed me but when they did we had a nice little conversationthen later i ran into one of my professor and i wa able to converse with them like a normal person normally if i were to run into one of my professor like that and they would try to talk to me i would get nervous and my mind would go blank not this time it wa like i wasnt even myselfi dont why but today i just felt normal for once i had been going through a period where i could feel my anxiety getting worse but those two interaction have put me in a good mood all day i feel the best i have in such a long time ,anxiety1926,hello basically during the last year i have lost faith or the desire to have friend finding something where it really work is difficult usually people change me or they

anyone where im going no cellphone no communication justby myself but sadly thats not possible for me,anxiety1928,is it unreasonable to think acquaintance could find my reddit account everyone i have encountered in recent year is very tech savvy because of school and work the thought that someone know my username and read my post or comment give my anxiety a full send into overdrivewhenever im interacting with people it all kissing as and censoring myself this is a place where i used to feel relatively anonymous at least enough to say thing i normally wouldnt in front of people now im not so sure there are a lot of strange coincidence in the thing people know about meim just so sick of feeling like this i can never relax and be myself my mind is just a constant flood of second

box we made for letter animal crossing inspired and i wa so excited about it she hate the choice of candy i made for the junk bar because it not fancy or formal enoughshe went full out against me the choice i made with my so and my tattoo  a whole different issue she started saying how everyone is going to think it tacky how they are going to ridicule u for using geeky stuff she say im not representing my family in a good light and that she is going to be so embarrassed on that day she wont even enjoy herself because everyone will surely be hating everything to the point that they will be absolutely gobsmacked and offended that my wedding is not traditional in decor it got ugly ive been with a stress migraine tight chest and trouble even breathing she simply decided that in the month that we have to see each other and three day before my wedding it wa a good idea to tell me how unelegant and horrible i am for not making choice that will make her happy her word and how she is my mother and the authority when im already  and havent lived in her house for the past  year i had such an amazing experience with my friend who helped plan my bachelorette in the city where i live they showed me so much love and acceptance in who i am and the thing i like then coming home to this always the same rejection and it clicked that awful and hateful voice in my head thats not out of the blue thats just my brain repeating everything my mom ha ever said to me i wa not born with this anxiety level i wa born being kind and curious and wanting to be free yet slowly she and other people like her took that away fuck bully especially if they are your own parent,anxiety1931,me and a cousin are going to have a cookout so he can teach me how to grill but he said a long a i buy

mentioned planning a lunch and asked if im on break yet i told her i wa but didnt put enthusiasm into saying i wanted to do the lunch we have a weird relationship lastly i had a nice chat with my dad and sister but i keep worrying i didnt talk to them long enough i should have asked my sister more question about herself her mental health her gf said a while back that she voiced we dont ask how shes doing enoughthe common denominator here is im way more worried about what other people are thinking of me did i please them enough how can i get out of this mindset or at least ease myself,anxiety1933,i recently started a retail job and talking to customer is no issue anymore since it the same conversation over and over and that i dont see them again but initiating conversation or continuing a conversation is extremely difficult for me i just dont know what to say most of the time and sometimes i hear conversation that i could interject in but i dont because i feel that it not my place to and then i think that i can contribute nothing to it so i just stay by myself this ha led me to believing that my coworkers think im weird and that they hate me or find me annoying when im in the break room and see a coworker walk in i dont say anything because i feel like im bothering them and then there an awkward silence and i immediately think that i shouldve said something i struggle with saying hi or bye to them bc i feel that they think it weird when i see my coworkers already have conversation with new coworkers that got hired after me i actually have a facepalm moment because i know i couldve been more sociable but my anxiety just hold me back ,anxiety1934,this is going to be long and out of hand but please bear with memy name is ian i am a th grader and i

group i just want one or two good friend that i can hang out with when im lonely and someone who understands my issue i decided i would try to overcome my social anxiety and make just one or two good

ive felt this bad since early high school i graduated university over half a year ago now i am extremely fragile completely taken out by criticism or having my problem dismissed while away at university i wa still socially anxious but i had a backbone and did not avoid people or life to the degree that i do now i find communicating with people outside my household difficult which is extremely isolating because i only live with my parent living at home is unhealthy for me but i dont know how to get my self out of this situation tackling the step to get out feel insurmountable my parent dismissed my feeling today by being unsympathetic to my hang ups about talking to my friendsfamily and telling me i overthink thing those simple word and action completely broke me for several hour before the interaction i had been working up to getting myself out of the house to do something alone for the first time in a week i wa going to go for a short drive and a walk in the next town over nothing special instead i hid myself away and spent the next three hour cry on and off and debating whether i wanted to make this post im at an extreme low point right now i only talk to one person from high school due to avoidance isolation and shame throughout high school community college and university im trying to overcome a few thing at once finishing up my resume and finding a job physical health i dont have a severe illness im just overweight due to inactivity and genetic factor depressive episode imposter syndrome my difficult relationship with my parent shame for depending on them despite being a grown adult and my avoidance of the very few people who still take an interest in my life therapy and medication doesnt seem to be helping i often feel le than human i am losing sense of self to an alarming degree it doesnt help that i consume so much medium book tv and movie about our bleak future bleak present and bleak past  a a specie maybe i should have posted

really suicidal i still do kinda but not a much im just sorta doing my time now i suppose i dont want to be alive and i certainly have really awful day mentally but i dont actively think about taking my life anymore this disorder ha robbed me of my teenage year it ha taken everything that i wa and destroyed it i am certain it will rob me of any future i have too,anxiety1946,sorry long post i wa up all night thinking about thismy parent would scold me when i wa acting weird basically like a kid im also the oldest sister so i had to have some kind of maturity but this basically lead me into being outcasted by other kid my age for example  i wa watching cartoon network and this really funny scene came up and i busted out laughing they told me to stop laughing like that and the next day cartoon network wa blocked i wa enrolled to this club where i started to play competitive tennis which i really enjoyed and even made some friend until one day my dad wa telling me to stop hitting with them because they sucked at playing and it wasnt going to help me progress with my skill at that time i didnt understand because i just played tennis for fun i wasnt looking into going serious and those were my friend we stopped going to the club and i lost contact with everyone there i practiced with my dad and i didnt really enjoy it because it felt more like a chore rather than something fun when i didnt perform well in practice i would get punished like getting yelled at during the car ride home grounded silent treatment tvphone privilege were taken away etc fast forward to high school i never really made friend because i couldnt relate to anyone or if i had met someone our friendship would never really progress because my parent were strict i didnt even bother participating in any schoolafter school activity because i knew it wa inconvenient for them to take me they wouldnt even compromise i didnt participate in any club because those required fundsactivities unrelated to school and i already knew they would not be okay with itim  year old now and my relationship with my parent are okay i see the way they treat my brother and sister and let me tell you it wa nothing like how they treated me people would tell me to cut them some slack because maybe they didnt know what to do since they are first time parent i dont really see how thats a reasonable excuse but okay i guess idk if they realized what they did to my childhood because i never really opened up to them about how i felt and i dont plan to but it just made me realize that when it my turn to have kid i wouldnt want them to experience what i felt,anxiety1947,why,anxiety1948,there a dude at my work who i get on well with  we did a secret santa and he said it a pity i didnt get you id have got you

language since i wa basically raised on the internet meaning i have a higher degree of fluency in english than i do in my native language that didnt go unnoticed by my science teacher yesterday and she started complimenting me over how impressive it wa that i wa proficient in a second language the fact that she singled me out for that kinda made me wanna snap out of existencemy presence in class so far ha been limited to answering question having attention on me and an expectation to actually respond to the compliment wa extremely overwhelming so i just awkwardly smiled which felt extremely stupid i hate how thats my goto response she started asking me question about whether my parent were immigrant or if i wa raised in a western country and i wa getting more anxious and kinda on the verge of cry i couldnt actually think much about her question and more about how i wa coming off to the rest of the class which didnt help my case when she asked about how the language barrier impact my ability to make friendship with peer to which i just blurted out that i didnt have friend then she started talking about how thats not necessarily a bad thing since keeping people at a distance mean you cant get hurt which wa an extremely flawed mentality but i obviously wasnt gonna argue so i had to agreethat probably destroyed any chance i had of making any friend heregetting approached by anyone since it established that i wa actively not looking for friend and not bothered by solitudethank you miss science teacher who name im not gonna disclose that wa greatly appreciatedjust please if youre a teacher or literally anyonemaybe dont pressure someone into answering personal question in a public space where theyre most likely just going to agree with you to get out of the situation therefore building a public image based on something they lied about that could very well destroy any hope they had of a potential social life thanks in advance partially over it just extremely salty and wanted to vent ,anxiety1953,how did it make you feeldid it help with certain somatic issue like blushing sweating shaking and so onim asking because im considering med a an additional help but

tried pushing myself way out of my comfort zone before and it only backfired it small step in the right direction that are more important it could be  year before i get where i want to be if i ever get there that might be too long for them but i have to do whats right for methey dont have to understand i just have to keep my boundary and do what i believe is right for me if they dont like that

but it just that i just easily talk with someone who vibe with me otherwise i dont like to bother anyone i dont like getting attention sometimes i feel like im avoiding certain people because im lacking confidence and awareness in life i feel deep down im not there yet for where im supposed to be for my age i mean im  now still in community college and havent taken any class because im overwhelmed and confused about my academic im watching others in life accomplishing their goal and working on their next big project it seems like a if im sitting in a bench seeing others win deep down i have that potential to succeed also but i dont know how to believe in myself i get the part im overthinking a lot and constantly living life in worry tension and overthinking but this overthinking ha lead me nowhere but feeling intense amount of overwhelmed i guess sometimes in life all we need is a little bit of push and motivation to keep u rolling but being an introvert it hard to ask for advice because in my head all i think is oh they must think im weak leak or softy or something when people view me a being seriously mature it like yeah im kinda but if i wa super mature then i wouldnt be stuck in one place for so many year i have to get out of my shell to grow a a person,anxiety1960,i just realized i never had a opinion of my own ,anxiety1961,i am so proud of my best friend he gone through his fair share of life problem but ha managed to be relatively successful im not jealous because im happy for him if it cant be my success id rather it be my loved one but i cant help but feel how much more successful and maybe satisfied with life i would be if i had an outgoing personality like himhe didnt graduate high school but ha been able to rise in the rank of his career by networking and making connection and now even ha a higher salary than me by a nice chunk even though i went to grad school and work at a big company he can joke with anyone and become part of the group easilyhes also gotten out of sticky situation by being able to talk to people and risk i would never ever take he done and ha pretty much gotten away with it it honestly insane and i joke that he living life with a cheat codealso since im introverted people naturally gravitate toward him and want to talk to him when were in group setting even if the people were with met me first cant believe how many time during these conversation someone will turn to me and call me quiet or if weve been drinking just flatout call me boring ive tried to mimic him in certain social situation that i think could benefit from but it never feel natural he can also hop on a job interview and land the role in a matter of day when i have to study and recite everything i would say for hour on end just to get one interview and a rejection i wish i had thatdoes anyone else know someone like that have you tried to learn from them,anxiety1962,i hate doing job interview i dont like being put on the spot and being asked question and being analyzed i dont have a job right now and i hate that society make it like this when i walked away i felt like there wa a wound in my heart and i wanted to cry i dont even know why sometimes i feel like social medium made social interaction worse for me and i had a friend who i think wa struggling with social anxiety and maybe it rubbed off on me because i didnt understand her and now im going through this ugh ,anxiety1963,ive been in small special need class but i had a few class with the big kid one of them being english since i wa good enough at it i hated it so much i would cry after class because the anxiety of having to read out a sentence everyone being quiet listening to your every word wa a fate worse than death just the possibility of having to answer a question or god forbid the previously mentioned reading something out in class always kept me on edge butthe past  year it quieted down a lot still awkward at point probably still more anxious than the average person but this week in english class the teacher asked what the answer were in a task and i just started listing off all of them without really thinking about it got a few wrong but i didnt ultimately careim still not the best with a lot of social situation but i cant even put into word how much ive improved but yet i dont know why nothing changed got a friend but ive had friend before and the guy doesnt even respect me changed school but everyone i had class with wa from the old school so the social factor felt the same i just magically slowly got better and it just feel so damn weird after a childhood filled with fear and misery of the outside world cant really give advice to anyone with anxiety but it doe get better even sometimes when it doesnt make sense,anxiety1964,when i first started my school when i wa late to a lesson i used to be terrified of walking in infront of everyone i today walked in late and sat down and the teacher started talking to me about what we they were talking about it actually wasnt that bad although i got abit red when she looked over half way through the lesson and asked if i asked a question i just looked away and she said no okayim done ranting but my advice is just say fck it,anxiety1965,at first everything wa fine until i started getting sick for  month and now i cant go to school because it getting to the point where i cant understand anything when im in a class my anxiety is starting to destroy me i cant do anything but hurt myself by eating a lot all the time i feel bad i dont feel like giving up for the third time because i failed my freshman year and i cant take it anymore  my friend are starting to distance themselves from me because i have told them my problemsi am suffering mentally and physically at this point i am a disgrace to my family,anxiety1966,fi hate that i am constantly being perceived a rude and impolite when dealing with my symptom with little to no empathy i have anxiety and panic in public sometimes i say panic like oh shit i think i gotta be outta here in the next  because it starting to build now in my head not snapping at every person who acknowledges me the problem is that i know when im being rude to someone on purpose and that is incredibly rare everyone in my life know my loving and warm nature i am a jokesterclown but i am dorky and empathetic about my humor i crave to connect with people and socialize to make them feel seen and heard but i have extremely high wall in public it not something i should feel ashamed about i have a really hard time wanting to randomly talk to anyone or stand to be talked to when i am approached out of the blue plus the thought of being rude to a stranger scare me i dont know who they are what if i offend them i bend over backwards to people please in every conversation sometimes i bite my tongue i dont argue back i dont know how to politely shake anyone off it feel crippling sometimes it embarrassing and i look like an asshole for trying to preserve myself and my dignity would they really prefer to see what my panic attack look like of course not wow you just got red and splotchy are you alrightyou still with me look like i lost yaman i love talking to sweet people like you that reminds me oh are you okay are you cry hey whats wrongdo you know how much i would give to be able to be cool whenever i wanted to stay cool in a random and polite conversation can some people gracefully and easily put up their guard like sunblock a skill howi spare both of u by running the only time i snap are out of selfpreservation when im in an unpleasant environment or social situation and i have no polite escape route or have tried them at some point im sorry but i really gotta go it not that i dont care i love talking to people and connecting but i feel like not being able to politely excuse myself when i have to take care of my personal need make me look like an antisocial asshole  a karen a cunt and my patience with myself run outmy preference on how long i desire someone company is completely my business and your preference is your business but how dare anyone try to make me feel i dont have a heart when they know what i struggle through and am offered no support or empathy stranger sure they dont know me but i have to protect my mental energy at all cost or it will kill me i have to choose myself first every time i am perfectly aware of the time i loved talking to someone who came up to me im a social and empathetic person my fight or flight is my daily struggle i also know that i have in fact exited conversation in a genuinely rude manner i just couldnt always prevent that i understand why i come off a rude sometimes to stranger i dont know how to put myself first and when i do guilt,anxiety1967,im a highfunctioning socially anxious person and ive carried a belief that the best way to cure it would be exposuretherapysoi took on a variety of hobby that could help me mingle i worked in a call center and progressed to another role that requires a lot of networking and negotiation and at the end of the day year laterive built a lot of solid friendship i have a small group of people i love and feel comfortable with and i wish i could say im cured but im still overwhelmed by the amount of networking i need to do i still abhore doing presentation speaking up in team setting still make me sick at time and i still dont know how to connect with people like it a second nature im tired of feeling incompetent and impostrous and i want it to stopwhats next publicspeaking course or should i turn to med i dont want to be dependent on medication so id like to know of anybody who taken them shortterm could see longterm effect,anxiety1968,i dont have the resource to get a proper diagnosis and even if i managed to get a diagnosis i wouldnt be able to afford medication since my parent definitely dont have the money to spare for that im quite certain i have social anxiety considering that i literally cant cough in a room with people without spending  minute forcing it down to avoid making noise then start worrying about whether or not the cough sounded fake even though im logically aware that no one is judging the legitimacy of my cough a someone who incapable of coughing in a crowded room or speaking without rehearsing my word beforehand then having a breakdown over my entire public persona being a performance that isnt even likable since it lack a speck of personality can i actually function in society after i graduate if eveni cant make friend talk to teacher or even attend school more than once every few week which is probably gonna make me fail this year even if i pas the exam since attendance account for like  of my grade but i also cant get medication or therapy or anything that will get rid of my anxiety at the moment id be able to if i manage to graduate get a job and cover my own expense but i dont think im capable of doing that with my brain working the way it is so it a paradoxtldr social anxiety is ruining pretty much every aspect of my life and i cant afford any type of treatment can i actually become a functioning member of society like thisanother thing to note is that im obviously selfdiagnosing i could very well not have sad and just be exaggerating my issue or misdiagnosing,anxiety1969,so i f have struggle with not necessarly making friend but keeping them  so last year i wa in a trio with two girl one used to be my bsf and im not gonna lie i wa a really cringey person and a shit of a friend at time so eventually they got fed up and stopped being friend w me keep in mind that they were my only friend at the time so when i lost them i started talking to other ppl in my school and after a while i befriended the new girl my current bsf i started to learn social cue and were more thoughtful with what i share to ppl or stuff i say etc and me amp her are now close we tell everything to each other were there for one another but i fear that i will slip back into my past self and that shell end up hating me too also now me and the other  girl i mentioned b are friend again but i feel like they still hate me and talk behind my back even tho they said that they like being around me and reconized how much i changed over the past year what should i do,anxiety1970,currently im waiting in a salon to get my hair cut and im anxious about just looking up and making eye contact like nothing terrible would even happen yet i feel so tense and constricted here,anxiety1971,what wa the effect like what change did you notice what wa your experience,anxiety1972,hey everyonei have quite a bit of social anxiety and it affected all part of my life especially my experience in college   i know that therapy is apparently the magical process that fix a lot of thing but im curious when therapy hasnt worked for you what problem did you have with it i just want to be prepared when i begin the process and im also just curious about any pitfall that come with getting a therapist  thanks a lot i hope that my experience with therapy is positive but of course a someone with social anxiety who always is afraid of the worst possible thing happening id really appreciate any information about the negative aspect of therapy,anxiety1973,some day i will not experience anxiety how we usually think of it regarding social situation but rather having a pervasive negative mindset and negative thought about socializing and other people in generalwhat is the point of socializing anyway what have my friendsfamily done for me lately if i did not have friendsfamily i could quit my job live frugally and just relaxim sure these people all think i am an ugly stupid loser and look down on me anywaymost day like  of the time i would say i am an easy going person  i wouldnt really consider myself an extrovert but feel like i get along with most people  i can generally hide these feeling but they do kind of crop up in way that are concerning having an attitude or grumbling when someone asks me to do something even if it easy and wont take that long taking criticism personally getting angry when someone is teasing me about something even if deep down i know they are joking putting thing off because they involve a telephone call generally being irritable  even if i wasnt planning on talking to anyone having this mindset that everyone thing i am an ugly stupid loser put me in a bad mood putting off trying new thing and having a negative attitude in general,anxiety1974,since the pandemic ive had problem with making eye contact i had a bit of social anxiety before the pandemic anyway throughout the pandemic ive been working night in a supermarket anti social hour and socially isolated myself a of last year ive found that even making eye contact with my own family ha been weird for me and it never used to the way i look at people face and make eye contact ha changed i either stare at people face for longer like im assessing them for something which feel weird to me people face are something that is just weird to now if that make any sense it to a point im anxious about approaching manager at work and asking what to do next ive had a few time with social interaction at work where i feel like im frozen in fear and end up acting a way that is out of my control so crippling im making the other people feel extremely awkward sometimes i actually have no idea how to get around this issue ha anyone else experienced this i want to find a new job but this problem in particular is stopping me from wanting to put myself out there at all feel like im just stuck im in therapy session but the way i see therapy session  they always treat you like there nothing wrong with you even if they agree you have a bit of anxiety i have social anxietyanxiety without a doubt i havent lived in what i say is the real world for such a long time like booking an appointment to do something going to let say dry cleaner a a random example going to get your car washed my mum will go for me just general every day stuff  yeah i dont live in that world i feel avoidant and just dont want to do thing because of anxiety,anxiety1975,im hiding in the bathroom a i often to because it the only place im not observed then a bunch of girl showed up and started talking really loud like really fucking loud my anxiety already started skyrocketing then they started saying questioning whether there wa someone in the stall why tf do you care do you really think someone care enough about your gossip the cherry at the top of it all wa that they finally pushed open the door i ofc pushed back but by now they knew someone wa here and so they left laughing honestly fuck them,anxiety1976,i hope this isnt inappropriate to discus on here and i dont want people to think that im a disgusting person this is something i havent told anyone in person because im afraid that people will think im dirty and a pervert which is unfortunately true i hate living with this but at the same time my mind enjoys this type of porn so before i get into it i just want to specify that i am a virgin so my obsession with this type of sex ha to do with porn not real life sex because im a virgin so the type of sex im obsessed with is anal sex ive longed to perform this type of sex with a girl ever since i wa in middle school here a little bit of background into my life to get some understanding of my obsession so i first discovered porn when i wa  or  year old i found one of my dad magazine and remember seeing nude woman i cant recall how i felt about it cause it been so long im sure it wa a mix of shock and curiosity though then a few year later i watched internet porn for the first time when i wa home alone and then around middle school age i started masturbating to porn and havent been able to stop since im yo btw im not exactly sure why i became so interested in anal sex but thats all i watch when it come to porn i have these unhealthy thought when i see cute woman in public and the thought just bombard me i cant stop them i dont know if the thought are intrusive or if they are actually thought that i want to have but usually the thought cause me to feel shame and disgust and i cant seem to overcome them then at some point i masturbate to porn again and reinforce those thought and it just a nasty cycle i use to fight the urge and lost that battle many time at this point i no longer try to fight the urge and basically just accept that this is who i am i wish i wasnt this dirty but i feel like my obsession with anal sex is just who i am i truly cant see myself ever overcoming it im seeing a therapist about this but shes not a porn addiction therapist so i might end up having to see someone who specializes in it im also afraid that if i ever do start having sex ill become even more obsessed if i can perform it with a girl in real life if there wa a magic button to erase my history with porn and this unhealthy obsession i would press it without hesitation it caused me so much pain and missed opportunity in life again i hope this isnt inappropriate to ask in a social anxiety forum but i really needed to get this off my chest maybe others can relate i would appreciate it if anyone ha any experience with this and might be able to offer some advice thanks,anxiety1977,removed,anxiety1978,i had a final oral presentation for my college spanish class today and it wasnt terrible ive been stressing out about it for  week and have been obsessively going over the powerpoint and practicing what i wa going to say over and over probably a hundred time i only got  and  hour of sleep last night and wa so nervous leading up to it when the time came i decided to volunteer to go which i never do and my voice didnt tremble at all i didnt shake either which ha happened to me during presentation before i did sound kind of monotone though and had some trouble figuring out the zoom mechanic and how to share my screen lol since it wa a presentation over zoom i think that ha a little bit to do with why i did okay but im just happy i didnt do horribly the relief i feel now that it over is unexplainable i feel proud of myself,anxiety1979,i work a a reservation specialist kill me but anyways there one day a week im scheduled in the call center in the back and it like heaven im away from everyone i can be on my own working reading listening to scary story or whatever but for one day i dont have to deal with the stress of facing people alllll day  my coworker who is very kind probably the second nicest person to me here in the entire office ha asked me if i could do check in for him aka give up my one day i dont have to do check in i want to be liked i want to be a team player and i hate letting people down but fuck this is a bigger sacrifice on me than he get and i hate not having and having to explain that he even teased he holding my notebook hostage until i agree  he really is nice but jesus he is making my day hard and i have only been here  minute  fml,anxiety1980,im recently in college and have been suffering whenever i have to do a presentation or just talk to an audience i absolutely mess up because i lose control over myself and my body especially what happens with my body ive done it  time and it never got better my heart beat so fast and my voice tremble all face seem blurry and i cant focus at all i forget everything i planned to say i lose my ability to think i genuinely feel so embarrassedi dont think it because of direct low self esteem or fear of others i get so anxious physically and mentally and it feel like my brain is shrinking and im closely under the sun i know many people have this fear but my case it way too awful so any tip please,anxiety1981,honestly i think my social anxiety started last year when i moved to a different high school in a different state on the first day i felt so nervous when people talked to me i wouldnt answer so they probably assumed that i didnt want any friend that wa my first mistake and then the rest of the year turned out horrible people in this school were racist im hispanic so that made me feel even more out of place and i would come home cry everyday i had no friend and once i even cried in front of the whole class when i had to do a presentation i tried to speak but i physically couldnt and then i ended up cry luckily after that day the teacher exempted me from presenting so i wa extremely grateful for that so yeah i dont know if me being in a virtual school not interacting with anyone is making this worse but it is what it is because my parent said that i cant go back to regular school until we move back to our old state and city because they also hate it here help,anxiety1982,im sure youve been in social situation where it looked like everyone wa staring at youyou start to wonder whether there is something wrong with your face hair and attire but when nothing unusual is observed you begin to ask why they were staring at me in the first place if there wa nothing wrongampxbi stumbled across a phycological study conducted by the university of london while doing some researchaccording to the study our attention a human is primarily drawn to face particularly the eye so when you find someone staring at you they are mostly looking at your face and eye attempting to figure out your focus of attention and emotional state the reason for this is because our facial expression gesture posture and tone of voice are all effective communication toolswhich mean our eye are continuously looking for something to focus on and when they find something intriguing they will lurk onit until they learn everything there is to know about itampxbafter reading research study and articlesi made an animated video to illustrate the topic psychology behind why people stare at youhttpsyoutubefrzmiyif you prefer reading i have included important reference link belowhope you find this

because all i worry about is how im going to support myself i fear i have no future because of this and feel my only solution will be to take my own life soon because there is no other way i am well into my s and have no career i grew up in extreme dysfunction with both of my parent being crazy my mom wa especially disturbed and i wa basically terrorized and controlled by her my entire life i grew up in squalor my parent hoarded object and animal i had to witness a lot of animal suffering and death my parent were also extremely racist and i wa not allowed to even look at someone with dark skin when i wa in grade school i wa secretly friend with a black student in my class one morning my mom wa dropping me off at school and my friend wa waiting for me at the gate when my mom saw him talking to me she parked her truck went into the yard and pulled me out by the arm in front of everyone pushed my friend and then started beating me in the car which everyone nearby could see she beat me up all the way on the drive home and once we were home she spent the entire afternoon beating and torturing me until she wore herself out when she wa done she cut off my hair comically short on one side thats the kind of life i had our window were glued shut and covered with wooden board or wallpaper and spray paint when my mom left home she would lock the house from the outside so we couldnt get out she made me sit in the living room until she came back to make sure my father wouldnt go outside or touch her thing you see thats the sort of lunacy i grew up with and that is just a drop in the ocean i went to college but i wa sick the entire time with severe social anxiety i could never figure out what to study because i wa never allowed to have a job so i ended up just going with something so i could graduate already a worthless degree i have k in student loan which arent going anywhere after college i found myself trapped at home with crazy parent unable to find a way out i had no social connection and didnt even know how to drive a car my mom always sabotaged any effort i made to become independent and wouldnt let me learn to drive or find employment i felt helpless hopeless and trapped i lived like that for seven year basically a shut in totally going insane and getting physically ill from lack of medicaldental care and eating a poor diet my mom continued to hoard animal at home so that further complicated my situation i felt like even if i could find a way out i couldnt leave because the animal depended on me to care for them during the last few year my mom health declined she went into kidney failure and had all sort of other medical problem from not taking care of herself being her caregiver wa a harrowing nightmare i also saw her die at home in front of me which wa horrible since my mom died i have been trying to build a life for myself shortly after my st birthday i became a truly free person and my life wa my own for the first time ever i have slowly made progress in improving my situation since then i can drive i have my license i have a good car i have a little money saved to get by i taught myself to ride a bike a an adult i found

hiking trail nature center wildlife preserve and zoo i love to be around animal and nature they bring me relief from all my depression and anxiety i take a lot of picture when im out there of the flora fauna and landscape mostly when i first got my license the car just sat in the driveway for quite a while because i had never had freedom before and didnt have any idea a to where i could even go but those are some thing i have discovered i enjoy throughout my life i enjoyed reading the cinema old music gaming my childhood dream wa to go to film school and be a filmmaker i remember those were the thing i enjoyed when i wa still alive now that im just a ghost i cant enjoy anything i am just sick with anxiety from the moment i wake up until i fall asleep constantly worrying about how i am going to make enough money and searching for answer i used to get panic attack just thinking about making a phone call or leaving a voice mail and now i do it with relative ease ive had some real world job and been to several interview over the phone and in person the job havent lasted more than  three month before i bail i feel like everything would be okay if i could just figure out how to support myself i get intense anxiety about knowing what line of work to pursue and then on top of that i have the social anxiety to contend with i have spent countless agonizing hour researching and deliberating over what i could possibly do for work but the answer never come the only thing i am halfway good at is caring for animal because it all ive ever done or known i thought about working a a veterinary technician but i cannot support myself on the low pay i tried becoming a pet groomer at a corporate salon i wa doing great but then i made a mistake at work and the little drama that ensued made me totally lose my morale and i started dissociating from the severe anxiety i ended up walking off the job while dissociated i tried getting it back after i felt better but couldnt i have thought about applying a a zookeeper at my local zoo but the pay is only hr because of my severe anxiety i am not cut out for healthcare job i freak out when i see open wound and thing like that i have taken class on web development digital marketing and it support and couldnt do it because of my anxiety all the roleplaying and having to perform in front of the class wa too much for me to handle i have a mental health counselor but the clinic assigned me a social worker and not a psychologist i appreciate her and enjoy having someone to talk to once a week but she is not really treating me for my anxiety or helping me becoming financially independent she tell me to think positively about myself and to apply to job i have no goal no sense of self no direction so i have no idea what to apply for i dont know where i belong i cannot look at myself in the mirror with the light on because i see a hideous monster i dont actually want to die i just feel i have no choice i am

dont mean to be creepy at all i just wanna converse more to improve,anxiety1995,my friend told me like if she sends back nsbdbdnabbd something like this mean she is left speechless or wanna eat the conversation i dont get it why am i always at the receiving end of this how do i make myself be more interesting over text conversation sometimes im left receiving one word reply so i take it a shes

project done i assumed that the other people on the team needed referral before they could proceed and i told the supervisor they would not be doing the project until they had the referral she immediately forwarded it to the team member and now im worried those team member think im throwing them under the bus the reality is im frustrated the supervisor ha gone  month not responding to me

witnessed this guy be cordial though still low energy with other customer and then immediately wither when i approach the counter and greet him  hell force out a terse mildly aggressive hi like a child being forced to greet someone they hate and afterward barely engage me verbally at all  it make me wonder if there something he find wrong with me  we both have long heavy metal hair maybe there some instinctual mistrust there  i have a cheap plastic jacket i wear when im just popping out to the store maybe he doesnt like how i dress  im also generally unhandsome maybe he just doesnt like looking at ugly peopleor is this person someone ive wronged terribly in the past and just dont remember  im horrified of that possibility that i could bring up bad memory for someone who essentially a stranger to me  or maybe it just that i paid with a big pile of change from my change jar one time and that pissed him off  i know ive done that cant say for certain i did it to him specificallyof course there also the possibility that ive completely imagined all this and im projecting my own insecurity onto the situation  maybe thats just how he say hi  maybe thats just the depressive way he chooses to slog through his shitty shift at his boring job  maybe he like that with everyoneregardless of the reality i cant stop my brain from overthinking everything and i absolutely dread seeing this dude  i dont expect everyone who serf me to be excessively cheerful either i know work suck and customer suck  i get that  but for the most part everyone i deal with out in the world is at least able to feign respect for me a a person when dealing with me  i dunno  make me anxious,anxiety2003,i have done so much research and i still cant come across a clear answer because the social life of

before i held it but i never got to posting before then even posting make me anxious lol for the last  year any presentation and most social situation are a disaster of trembling redness shortness of breath acute headache and mumbling until it over i refuse to take any med or see a therapist idk why anyway i reached the final of a uni course where the finalist present answer judge and compete for some significant money in front of all national participant i have presented about  time this year for smaller group and while the gut wrenching feeling is the same the anxiety wa clearly le visible than previous year i tried for a while to sabotage my spot in the final to avoid presenting but i thought i would do it since it my last uni assignment and i could use the money and personal experience it wa on my mind for week troubling my sleep but by memorizing the presentation word for a well a prepping for any question i might receive i somewhat convinced myself i could get it over with a im almost at the venue to present im restless and in panic mode i mostly prepare for anxious event with breathing excercises no caffeine almost no food and tiring myself out physically with excerice but i felt more adrenaline or anxiety than ever i got to the venue and sat all the way in the back pretty much shaking and taking intensely long breath with break by the second presentation i felt that i had gained some control back because i knew itd be over soon enough the whole setting seemed calm and it is technically all in my brain i knew the word by heart and would exclusively make eye contact with the judge and the presentation screen i wa third to present and i walked by the whole crowd grabbed the mic and started talking loud af and with shoulder raised occassionally i had a nervous tick and put the mic down for an extended breath but everything went unexpectedly well by the time the judge asked me critical question i actually had some confidence and connected with the crowd i didnt win and my anxiety will never fully go away but improving by doing ha really helped me and given me some pride for the first time in age peace,anxiety2012,how doe one respond to these

my insecurity i am scared of manipulative people a i am blind sometimes to their motif thankfully i do get red flag despite not knowing manipulative game and stuff i feel too clueless and innocent

program last  year supposedly i should be comfortable by now supposedly i wouldve made friend and some connection nope for   year ive only been not talking and never getting involved in conversation i only watch my classmate smiling talking and confiding with each other and genuinely enjoying themselves i just sit around that is all people know me for for being quiet i do not enjoy anything we do in this class not even field trip or socialemotional bonding activity while my classmate say the opposite the room is so sickingly white bright and cold and it miserable ive only been doing whatever i have to do a i frequently look at the clock with a headache i dread that class everydayas my teacher and my classmate agreed to we are like a family this class is insufferabletoday my regular teacher wasnt here so we had a substitute we had an assignment that wa posted online to work on but i forgot my laptopit wa probably my increased anxiety that prevented me from telling the sub and asking for a loaner laptop i just couldnt do it i cant rationalize it i just couldnt i just hoped that that the sub wouldnt notice me while i did something else a discreetly a possible except she didshe asked me what i wa doing and i said that i forgot my laptop of course i wasnt expecting her to let me off the hook she said well go get a loaner and something about getting my work donei wa about to say something but i stopped not even halfway through my sentence and just shook my head not to say no but a an involuntary reaction to how i wa unable to muster a sentence i already felt my face getting hot and tear in my eyesshe and my classmate were silent and i felt them staring at mei barely remember what happened right after that but i did not do the assignment or any work i pathetically sniffed and cried a i texted my only source of support my mom meanwhile my classmate were having their nice fucking conversationthe sub wa getting annoyed she frequently walked over to me and saw me with my open binder for another class clearly not doing the assigned work with my phone and texting behind it she told me something and then a few moment later something else saying that this is her last reminder my classmate again got silent a they stared at me and then went back to their conversationthere are point when everything pile up beyond it limit your head cannot afford to deal with anything else much longer and you automatically stop giving a shitso i continued to not do my work and used my phone the sub thought i wa a defiant student i dont doubt at all that she will write down my name and tell my actual teacher about thisone of the girl who wa doing her work on her laptop later asked unotz are you ok but i didnt answer after some them the sub went up to me and kneeled down and wa telling me something i wa not making eye contact with her and i wa looking down at my binder she asked what are you looking atfor the majority of class i cried while my classmate were having their conversation like normal they were even playing music i have hated this class for so long it just one bad experience after anothermy classmate would make a big deal of i mess up for example i once held a rabbit and it jumped out of my arm he wa fine and i wa trying to pick him back up so i could put him back in his cage and people around me stared at me and made noise woah woaah like i committed some horrible sin and multiple people were looking at the rabbit saying i feel so bad for that rabbita few month ago we were trimming a bird wing feather after getting practice with paper cutout i wa nervous at first but i had the courage to volunteer to try out the real thing before i started though i told my classmate to let me know if i have to change the angle of the scissors and just check if im doing it right they were like sure sure we got you i put the bird wing feather in between the open blade of the scissors at a specific angle my classmate go no no no no so i adjust it and they still go no no what i didnt even cut anything it just guesswork at this pointmy classmate talk to me in a high pitched voice a if im a  year oldi truly cant handle this anymore school and

nothing much how bout you which is usually the end of it and then i cringe at myself for the next hour for not having anything more to say i know they mean well but what are people expecting when they say whats up anyway do they expect a proper conversation from me in return if you had nothing to talk about why would you go through the effort of approaching me anyway is it weird that i dont

expose myself to social situation everyday and put myself out there i also play live music but it never seems to get any better now i am just unhappy in most of the situation i also workout and eat healthy drink le alcohol workout seems to give me some relief but unless i do it everyday the effect will go away quickly and sometimes life dosnt allow me to work out every dayaround december  i started to realize that maybe i need a change of brain chemical i never liked the idea of antidepressant so i started with natural supplement such a magnesium rhodiola roseaashwagandha etc and my desperation also led me to try cannabis product andpsilocybin which i dont really recommend these drug had a short term healingrelief but nothing lastingi then decided to try anti depressant last december  i wa on venlafaxine with very good result on my mood and anxiety but had so much hair loss on it and it wa dose dependent so stopped i then tried setraline with very minor improvement but a lot of sexual side effect some month ago i tried trintellix which did nothing but give me sexual side effect some of the sexual side effect seems to be a bit too persistent for my comfort i still have way le sex drive even month after quitting so i dont really wanna use ssrisnris againmy psychiatrist prescribed memirtazapine which i didnt try yeti am also looking into some nootropics that might have le side effectsi would love to try tm but where i live it is not a possibility unless i pay full price myselfis there anything else you guy can recommend me  to try a trype of therapy non

struggle with basic grammar i dont know what to do i interact with people all the time yet my english is almost worse than it wa three year ago help,anxiety2022,if god ever granted me a wish thatd last a day id ask for this i really wanna know and feel what it like to be an extrovert for just a day to be open loud confident and not giving a shit what others feel to not feel trapped for a day they just wake up talk and socialise like it so normal and end their day on a note of not giving a fuck about the tiniest of thing that would bother me like an everest,anxiety2023,i f have never had a boyfriend a i have really bad social anxiety and find it hard to talk to anyone but especially the opposite gender the only time that i came close to a relationship wa in school a i seen him everyday and became comfortable enough around him to talk but then i got scared and didnt take it any further but now ive been done with school for almost  year and it so hard because i dont talk to guy ever and im so lonely all my friend are getting into relationship and i watch so many film and tv show and im so jealous because i want that but have no idea how to get it the only time i go out is if im with someone which is mainly my mum or sister and thats usually only to the shop im really scared that ill be alone forever and i really dont want that but i dont know how to overcome it,anxiety2024,i dont really talk much at work and i already feel so anxious i dont want to go but i feel like it would be good for me i just want to get blackout drunk,anxiety2025,i know cbt and dbt skill but it just seems to be a thing for me that i still may need to consistently have therapy in order to deal with stuff in general i have ocd a well a anxiety and im autistic so it kind of lead to more overall social anxiety for me a lot it seems to kind of be getting worse i am seeing a psychiatrist soon about seeing about stuff medication wise but the problem is one of my medication for anxiety make me extremely tired so if i take it everyday i would be sleeping a lot and i have already been overall more tired for a while i dont see the psychiatrist frequently im on a wait list for a therapist but im apparently ninth in line for it so i dont know what that mean for how long it is going to take me to get one and now i dont really know what further to do if im waiting this long and the therapist is not compatible so is there any advice on what to do because of it i worry also because im making friend with people who might also have anxiety because of also being autistic so im kind of anxious about me being anxious the issue is my anxiety ha had a great spike i am not sure if it is because it is winter or what online communication via text is the primary issue especially with people i am talking to which is common but yeah i know some people dont like them but we find the tone communicator stuff helpful but sometimes i dont know if they are always  foolproof in every situation,anxiety2026,doe anyone else sometimes feel like no one know their name i work in an office with  or so people but i only work with a handful of them daily other than these people i feel like no one else in the building even know my name or who i am i just feel like im so easily forgettable and unnoticeable that even though ive been working here for almost a year no one really remembers me im not saying anyone ha to go out of their way to befriend me or anything like that but there just something really discouraging about having people you see everyday not even know your first name,anxiety2027,being talked over is one thing but ive had people feel like theyre doing me some favor by assuming ive already failed the interaction and do the talking for me ill use today a an example recently we got a new person at work and she ha tried making conversation with me on a few instance today she asked me if i liked rock music well kinda i love metal and i started with an uh a i always do and i wa legitimately about to try to talk with this person about it however another coworker chimed in with something like ohhh no i dont think hed wanna talk about that  becauseim quiet and quiet people cant like rock music i guess anyway the woman i wa going to talk to turned back in response to the other coworker and started joking like heyyy im trying to make friend here lololol but they just kinda started joking around on their own i had a potential conversation there something i could actually engage in i could actually say something about myself and let someone get to know me a bit nope cant have it not allowed apparently im the designated quiet weirdo and have to accept that fact,anxiety2028,i have a friend who ive been trying to talk to more but im not good enough ive tried talking about interest and shes really into dbd so i try talking about that but then i draw a blank after like one sentence i dont know how to be interesting i dont dont know what else to talk about cause everything else is a sure i dont know maybe i dont know how to be interesting enough to spark those topic or conversation that go for  minute shes great but sometimes i just dont wanna talk to her because i feel like a failure,anxiety2029,whenever i get nervous my first instinct is to get away from people a quick a i can before i start cry i hate this so much it didnt help today that my whole class got into group for an group assignment and i wa the only one without a group it took me  minute just to get my thought to stop rushing in order tp even think about simply asking to join a group so i wrote on a small sheet of paper asking to join a group until i realized they were all full so a a last resort i decided to try participating a i would in a group hopefully conveying that i wa alone and needed someone to work with and what happend not only did i screw up an easy question i could have answered fine if i wasnt nervous but i got lectured by my teacher in front of the whole class for being alone after everyone got their stupid snicker in everyone went back to working i swear it took me all i had to hold it together and we have to do this for the whole week i just cant understand why it so funny to other people i deal with this endless spiral of anxiety everyday and apparently the only significance i serve at school to my classmate is to be a comedic relief i just dont know how to deal with this i feel rejected i feel ignored and i just feel helpless altogetherdoes anyone have any advice or technique they use that maybe i could try using to stay calm i know i cant change how people treat me but i want to be able to not let myself get to that point especially not in front of my classmate im really sorry how long this wa im just really in need of advice and i thought this subreddit would be the place to ask for it,anxiety2030,due to recent event ive lost  out of my  close friend and all of my friend from

and half not i made a post about my anxiety doing this joke thing on thursday so a little bit of a backstory my teacher decided a couple of day ago that wed all do this joke thing for the parent at school to get them into the festive spirit school know i get worried but i dont know if they notice i have been diagnosed with anxiety by a psychologist my mum took me to see when i wa getting bullied at my old school now that psychologist signed me off when i got my place at my current school  i saw her for some support after getting bullied at my old school but my mum also mentioned some issue going off at home she gave me advice on how to cope with my issue but those only worked for a few day and then i wa back to my old habit again i decided i wouldnt go a therapist because i watched this reality tv show where people go a see therapist and they all say the same thing so whats the point i explained that i rarely like speaking about my mental health but it also easier to do it online where i dont know you all because it easier to speak to people anonymously i went through some trauma which led to extreme anxiety issue and google is saying i have symptom of depression but i dont think ive actually got depression though  my last post i posted on a few different subreddits i wa afraid i wasnt gonna get a response and i wa really desperate i got response luckily for me some people told me to go and get therapy and tell my mum other people wa saying i should suck it up and do it and others were saying find some else to replace instead i wa gonna fake sick i fake sick sometimes sometimes my mum belief me and sometimes she doesnt but since this thursday i really wanted to not do this joke thing i have to do i couldnt fake sick because i wa actually sick all last week and wa informed by text message from my friend that i would be doing joke at the show i decided to tell my mum i made up my mind this morning on the way to school that i wa gonna try to speak to her about it or at least tell her not to come because my anxiety get worse when my mum come to watch me my last event i told her not to come she didnt come but she got really offended and i felt bad about it i have some trauma ill never speak to anyone ever about because it just to traumatic for me to speak to anyone about but anyway i wa just about to tell my mum when school rang my mum to sort out the seating arrangement for this thursday and shes coming when she got off the phone i started to cry really bad and i couldnt stop i got told to calm down and there no need to cry because i told i wa doing joke and i got told im funny they wont care if i make a mistake i dont want to even be funny i cried and cried for like an hour and a half and because she wa scolding me and basically calling me crazy and told me to stop multiple time and calm down she told me to get my big girl knickers on when i stopped but wa starting over and over again i wa gonna go into my room and calm down but she stopped me and basically threatened to call school and tell em i wa being a lunatic over this show i darent tell her i had a panic attack at school that lasted about m and asked to be excused from lesson to calm myself down because i couldnt calm myself downit wa about my dad scan he had this evening i couldnt focus on my school work because in my head family come first before school any day everythings ok with him thank god im usually really good at hiding my problem and emotion and pretending to be happy but this time i wasnt able to i think it because a got told off a million time for not concentrating but ya see thats thing if youre talking amongst yourselves i have to know otherwise ill most likely have a panic attack because i know when somethings not right and it worry me because i dont know it just doe i recently wrote a post about my brother possibly going trans he didnt my mum sister and dad tried to tell me it wa about my dad fish next try guy but do you really expect me to believe youre gathering in one room to talk about fish food im  my mum ha anxiety too so i thought the one person whod get my anxiety about performing is my mum when i eventually got ready to speak to her but i knew shed get offended but im afraid to even try to speak to her because i know shes ha feeling i have no one to speak to other than my mum i hate my fucking life so much now my dad an alcoholic he got sober but then sadly he relapsed he get drunk every night my sister i wont get involved for personal reason and my brother he got his own problem and worry and he get tired easily and he antisocial like me but worse im aware my mum not a mind reader but i just want her to know my feeling and not get mad so whats the point in having emotion ill they do is cause me trouble like i said this statement half metaphorical but some day i wish i couldnt feel emotion it wa really hard to calm down when i couldnt go somewhere and cry i cry every other day because im a sensitive child due to trauma so that make my life  million time a hard so i cry over stupid stuff at least almost every day i dont know what to do anymore because i have anxiety over load right now and this thursday isnt helping again i cried writing this post and so i wanted to finish it today i know i dont like opening up but again im so desperate i know im gonna get judged but what do i do i arent getting my oldest sister involved for again personal reason and a well a the personal reason shes got a  year old child to look after,anxiety2039,idk why or how it work but the more time i

let me tell my parent even just the thought of telling them about my interest or expressing myself outwardly at all made me feel so embarrassed and ashamed so there wa no way i could tell them about my feeling or ask them for help that being said though i know that they knew at  they found a text id sent to a friend about how badly i wa doing and they said they were very confused but that they were there for me if i ever needed anything i have still never willingly expressed just how badly i wa suffering to my parent but they had a very clear idea from that text and they did almost nothing

them and i hid a much a i could but i wa just a kid and i know i couldnt have been hiding that well i dont know what my parent could have done for me given the situation but i know they shouldve done something doe it even count a emotional neglect if i wa trying so desperately to hide my emotion how could they have helped me if i wa never able to ask for help,anxiety2053,not that anyone here

when it just a text message ive tried talking to like minded people online but i ghost them after a day because the stress of having to entertain someone and worry that im boring is just too much i want to just compliment someone on the street for a start but i have a resting bitch face and i feel a though i sound monotone and ingenuine that every time i try people think im insulting or sarcastic this is so hard tt,anxiety2057,recently i had a conversation with a friend of  year and it felt nice because throughout the year we had sort of drifted due to having to study for final exam my anxiety wa somehow brought up and my friend revealed to me that they had purposely distanced themselves from me because i wa too much and my anxiety stressed them out this really hurt me and still hurt me i literally cried for hoursim not too sure of what about my anxiety that stressed them out and i want to know and communicate properly with them but im too scaredbut at the same time ive  reflected a little this conversation wa a week ago and i want to try cut tie subtly it sound silly to do so over this type of situation but it made me realise that maybe since the both of u have changed so much our friendship will never be the same again,anxiety2058,ugh im trying to leave my toxic restaurant job right now and get into a new job in the field i want my career to be in medical

prior experience is in a medical setting i hate interview because i feel like im so awkward and nervous any tip to nail the next one,anxiety2059,i am sick and tired of fumbling every social interaction i have with new people i am a college junior and i just transferred to a bigger school this semester ive just tried to make friend through the mere exposure effect but i have had extremely limited success usually i just end up making acquaintance without making legitimate connection im considering getting a xanax prescription to deal with the social anxiety but im afraid that i will become physically dependent on it ha anyone had success with other medication that dont have such a high risk of dependency,anxiety2060,so i turned  in may ive always been a more outgoing person liked to isolate yes but usually very good in social situation i feel like i wa pretty charming actually dated a lot had a lot of friend of all kind but something just happened like a year or so ago i juststopped being that way when im around people ive known forever i feel like the entire conversation is forced there will be several long period of silence when i talk i can tell there is a struggle to listen and when someone else talk it take a lot for me to really engage with what theyre saying i end up saying thing that are very strange or i sound self centered or i just dont know how to have human emotion apparently and there this weird thing where i cant be faced away from people i will feel a part of my body twitching or wanting to twitch in a way that will look weird and so i move strangely i dont know what to do i dont have many friend now and idek if wed be friend if we didnt smoke together bc i think theyd probably find me really boring and awkward i had a situation where i wa homeless right before i wa supposed to go to college so thats not an option neither is any social life that would come with it what do i do am i just going to be this way is there a way to fix all of it,anxiety2061,hi there ive been struggling with sad since i wa about  year old and im now  i find it so weird because i can easily approach stranger and be the life of the party in a big group with minimal anxiety only when i am one on one with a friend do i get really anxious constantly thinking i am not interesting enough or not funny enough they would rather be hanging out with someone else i even get that way with life long friend and even my sister who is probably the closest person to me i feel like the closeness make me more anxious and i would much rather have random conversation with stranger doe this come from an intimacy problem interesting enough i never feel anxious with romantic partner a i feel like sex is a common denominator that we share while with friend i feel like i have nothing to offer them just curious if anyone else feel this way and how have you approached it,anxiety2062,im a senior in high school i had really bad social anxiety in freshman year a in i would sweat a ton and blush immensely anytime someone i didnt know very well would talk to me it senior year and ive felt like ive grown a lot but regressed in many way i dont blush or sweat that much anymore and although im terribly socially awkward ive managed to make my way to high leadership position in many team and club in my high school including speech and debate while this look great on paper i barely participate in any of class and people in my class who arent in the extracurriculars i lead dont know i exist i spend my hr long commute to and from school either alone or with  friend who often travel with many friend of their own i sometimes just breakdown on the subway i want to talk to people but fear of  being judged when i suddenly strike up a conversation with the person i sit next to in class who i neverrarely talked to over the past few month although my school speech and debate team is wellknown in our school i dont want people to know im a leader on it i know that theyd think something along the line of them the speech and debate team and a leader but they never participate in class ive never heard them talk i feel bad about being a leader i can think of  people who are more qualified and charismatic to lead i dont feel like i have anyone to vent to there a teacher that help supervise the team but im not nearly close enough to her to talk about this kind of stuff i also think she ha a bad impression of me since im although im a leader i dont perform that well at competition nor am i very committed to the team there also this afterschool leadership meeting everyday with all the leader of the team i never talk to the other leader because i feel like they have a low opinion of me a well the people that ive vented to before including my family have used my insecurity against me in argument ive become a lot le open and trusting to anyone nowadaysand yeah im not sure how this became a rant of how speech and debate an activity i used to decently enjoy participating in ha become the fuel to my social anxiety worry but if anyone could provide some advice or anything id greatly appreciate it,anxiety2063,i always feel like running away when i see someone cry in public i even think to myself why here where everyone can see then i immediately feel ashamed however i cant stop feeling this way like whenever someone express a hint of vulnerability or expression i feel my heart beating faster and i cant even swallow properly i feel relieved when all the sharing and feeling are gone i especially hate sharing anything about myself such a how i am feeling i feel so vulnerable when i show any expression other than a blank face im not sure why im like this is it because of social anxiety,anxiety2064,okay first off im not asking for an actual diagnosis of course this is kinda like a second opinion sort of thingim always worried of what people think of me it depends on how well i know someone though with family im not worried at all but with friend i only talk to at schoolmessage from time to time half of my thought are just overthinking how to respond if im being annoying if im being funny enough etc   i have a lot of friend right now my whole life ive had  or  best friend and thats it but last year i became friend with someone with ton of friend so i got to know those people and this year that friend go to a different school but i still had a head start because i already know multiple people so im more comfortable and met new people too so now i have  friend and  best friend and it pretty cool it nice to have friend to help in different class and stuff but even though i like talking to my friend i still have that fear of how they think of me so i overthink what i say making me not say much at all or my response sound forced and uncomfortable so im super awkward but i like talking to them but i dont cause i feel so insecure  sometimes when i message a friend i notice myself shivering even if im not cold at all i shiver and i bring this up because it always start when talking to a friend online and im never cold and it always go away when i stop talking to them im so worried what people think of me i never share my own idea or actually try in front of anyone because if they see me try and i fail ill look stupid but i can completely avoid that if i dont try at all right whenever im doing an assignment im paranoid someone is looking at me doing my work so i turn my computer brightness down or i sorta cover the paper with my hand sometimes i just dont do the assignment all together because im forced to try in order to get a good grade and im too worried of what my teacher will think  sometimes i just want to express to my friend that i know i suck i know im ugly i know im unfunny i know im annoying etc etc just so they dont think that i think im good lookingfunny and so on so it le of an embarrassment for me i mean i never say any of that but i want to also i hate talking to friend when im in class and the room is quiet enough so someone next to u can hear what were saying not because i have anything to hide but because now i have  people to worry about i have to worry about my impression on the friend im talking to and the person overhearing u like there this one kid that sits behind me and my friend and he sits alone so he never distracted by someone else so i know he hears everything and he one of those people who are nice but can be a bit judgmental not outright rude but yk the most anxious i feel is when talking to boy im a girl well i think im a trans boy but idk and i kinda feel like boy are superior to me i always have the bias that a boy is funnier or if a girl is unfunny i think it because of her gender and in my head i put a lot of pressure on girl to be funny or stuff like that so they can prove that girl are funny idk but i feel pressured to be funnier around boy to prove girl are funny but like always i end up being awkward and not funny at all it doesnt help that im not too funny in the first place lol okay this post ended up being way longer than i thought it would sorry but

thought of am i doing the right thing or just not enough drive to start somethingim not an alcoholic i actually barely drink once per week maybe le and always one beer or soim trying to figure out how i can achieve the same effect without drinking alcoholis it a lack of dopamine in my brainis it anxietyampxbwhat do you think,anxiety2113,im  and female and my social anxiety is ripping me and my life to shred it isnt a bad a it could be i can sometimes talk to people if they talk to me it just approaching people on my own is hard i dont have the courage to say hi to anyone apart from teacher i generally dont know what to say to people and ive had breakdown about it i strangely enough didnt have this all the time i wa a very social kid in like th grade i could literally talk to a friend across the classroom with ease and with no anxiety or fear of judgement at all i dont know what happened to me and why i have social anxiety so suddenly i guess it from a bad situation i had going on year ago i honestly dont know what to do at this point i likely wont be able to get a job and ill probably have to go on welfare to live im in canada my parent sometimes get mad at me for this and tell me im not even trying maybe i am not trying but it just so difficult my dad doesnt understand how hard it is for me and think it a piece of cake cuz he had social anxiety apparently a a kid and got over it after doing public speaking i have  friend at school since i moved away from the city who dont even talk to me online i used to hang out with them at lunch but one of them isnt going to be at school physically this whole semester and the other eats lunch in the caf i also have separation anxiety agoraphobia and gad which make thing worse ive been on zoloft for about a month i think and i dont see a change deep breathing doesnt quite help me and i pretty much just isolate myself from the world i feel like a burden to my parent cuz of all my anxiety issue i dont wanna be like this i wanna be social i wanna have friend i wanna be how i wa before but i dont know what to do i dont know how to talk to people unless im comfortable with them and even sometimes thats hard back when my  friend hung out with me at lunch when they talked to me it like my brain wa blank but also rushing to come up with an answer  i even had an instance with my parent at taco bell my mom wanted me to order food and in my head i wa like ok i can do this im gonna do this but then when it came down to it my body completely froze i physically couldnt speak no matter what i did in my head i told myself cmon say it but i just couldnt i kept looking at my mom to order for me since she usually doe it and she just scoffed shook her head and ordered for me once i got my food we went back to the car and i got yelled at she told me i couldve done that i told her i couldnt no matter how hard i tried and that i physically couldnt speak and it wa like she wa annoyed she also tell me that i wont be able to live past  without knowing how to talk to people and that i wont have friend if i dont socialize which just put me into a bigger mental pit than i already am the only way i can think of ever having a chance at getting friend and just making it through life is when my boyfriend come and life with me which i dont know when will happen since he in college atm hed have to introduce me to people and actually help me i worry ill be a burden to him a well since hed pretty much have to parent me and be by my side all the time he say im not a burden but i still worry  i told my mom once how im more comfortable talking with my boyfriend in public we meet at a mcdonalds in the city and she got all offended saying were youre parent you feel more comfortable with your boyfriend than with u that hurt you know maybe thats because of that instance at taco bell and now it make me feel like i have this huge amount of intimidation and judgement hanging above me whenever were in a fast food restaurant  my mom told me today i have an appointment with a therapist online this week so maybe thatll help me i just dont know what to do at this point my life is a total mess,anxiety2114,so my social anxiety wa so bad at the start of  that i just physically couldnt go to schooli would have panic attack and my body hurt just so bad that i would even throw upthis basically caused me to miss school from february until the school year endedin that time me and my parent did everything to help me go back to school i visited countless therapist and even wa in a mental hospital i wa there for only  week because everything there just made thing worse and they were really unprofessional if im honestbut in the end i didnt manage to go for the rest of the yearover sommer break i managed to get myself back under control and i wa actually very excited to go back to school againand when the school year started i went back without any problem at least for the first weekafter that it went back to being really bad again but this time i literally forced myself to go a much a i wa able tobut i still missed a lot of daysmy teacher only made thing worse every day i missed i would need to text her that im not going to school that day and also give her a valid reasonand just saying that i wa having a really hard time mentally wasnt enough and she would send back really inconsiderate text wich made me miss more school because i wa scared of seeing her againi have  day of school left before winter break and my teacher is constantly telling me that i need to go regardless if i want to or noti know that i know that i desperately need to attend school more or else i need to redo the year but all the pressure from everyone is just making me more nervous and disappointed in myselfmy parent arent much help either they just tell me the same thing my teacher tell mei also have a therapist but she focus more on helping me with my depressionif im honest with myself i dont know why im even posting thisbut maybe someone ha gone through something similar and ha some advice or something also sorry for any bad gramma english isnt my first language and im also cry while writing this,anxiety2115,i feel like this wa a turning point of my social anxiety and tbh wa very much my own fault in  i worked a a teaching intern at a large high school along with three other intern i had only mild social anxiety at fhr time but wa still very much socially inept so i asked a fellow studentteacher to coffee one day but due to my social anxiety i felt more comfortable doing it online so i messaged her on social medium i noticed that she read the message but didnt reply here where my lack of social awareness come in a couple month later i figured id try again i reasoned that perhaps she saw the message got distracted and didnt reply perhaps looking back it wa pushy and this time she declined saying she wa seeing someone embarrassing but not the end of the world a month or so later a student approached me during morning break and said a remour wa circulating that i asked mr xyz out twice i wa mortified luckily the kid at this school were nice and it didnt become an issue i figured there were only three option  she told the student herself  she discussed it with another teacher in a place where student could reasonably hear it  she told another intern who told the student i asked her about it and she denied having said anything and wasnt sure how anyone knew when i pointed out that it doesnt make sense she said it happened move on i still feel embarrassed when i think of it today i havent dated or anything like that since it wa without question a humiliating moment and i regret having done it,anxiety2116,anyone else in their s struggling with trying

it really hard to tell and can say ive only noticed it on a few occasion like i recall somebody and go yeah most likely shehe wa dealing with it tooim not sure what my point is it probably more common than we realize and others probably have no idea you struggle with it  maybe you worry it visible in most case it isnt but some behavior are a clue not that we should be going around diagnosing people anyway,anxiety2165,i noticed every time i meet people especially when i have to socialize with people i dont know much like at work friend party extended in law family gathering  i will think back about the conversation ive had and reaction that i got it sometimes can bother me for a week for many thought like  i felt i didnt fit in the group  i didnt say the right thing  i gave a bad impression i looked awkward did i hurt someone feeling  why they ignore me  why they glared at me  it is annoying and when i tell my boyfriend about it he say you exaggerate you overthink so i dont tell him about it anymore unless the people concerned are his friend or family member,anxiety2166,sorry guy but i really need some space to shout it out it feel unbearablem had quite shitty childhood in a thankfully wealthy yet very cold depressed and mentally complicated family or just dysfunctional a my therapist call it a i see it now there were lot of unhealthy pattern involved my parent always wanted to divorce father hated his well paid job and did it only because of his deep personal fear this made him mean and aggressive asshole towards everyone except his friend mother have an alcohol addiction and sometimes i saw her lying in a bed in inadequate condition with bottle of wine this is usually happening one or two time a yeari remember feeling happy and just good in my early day but with the beginning of school it started to become a nightmare a parent suddenly became nervous very strict and started to threaten me for not putting enough effort on my study since my first year of public elementary i wa heavily bullied and neglected from school environment for being a weirdo like ralph from simpson sometimes beaten without being able to protect myself every year some kid pretended to be my friend but under pressure of others soon ended up joining the bullying never felt for this entire time that i can completely trust anyone since there wa no one who seemed to help me i had to cope with feeling myself and did some success in selfanalysis somewhere at  started realizing i wa gay from an antigay state propaganda lmao yeah they should never know it can work out on the opposite way there wa a long process of accepting myself including a period of selfdenial trying to go to church depression blahblahblah and it still not compete a i partly remain in closet my country educational system is based on stuffing your head like a thanksgiving turkey with tone of dry useless theory from book and it quite normal for student to overwork for their state exam up from my final grade ive been one of them sleeping for  hour and giving up on my social life   ended up in a good uni though but with a program imposed by my parent because designer will be replaced by ai soon and you are worthless in that also for male it is important to go for uni after school or they will be forcefully sent to army i knew how shitty wa that place so never actually thought about gap year it took me a lot of time and effort to prepare and change my degree and with ton of resource involved i have managed to swap it with what i really wanted then finally got my parttime and wa able to move out ive made some good friend with similar problem in their life and weve created a great supporting network for each other finally my life wa started to improve slowly step by step shortly after that the covid thing broke out and ive stuck at my rented apartment in a complete solitude moreover my uni decided to significantly increase the program load so since then weve rarely met each other because of our busyness and a remote on demand study mode this is when ive finally realized my chronic loneliness and the worst thing is that im still too scared to just go out and casually build new connection i want to be surrounded with people i want to get my first kiss and boyfriend i want to wind down at am not at am i want to find a hobby and stop being a workaholic with no break i just want to be fucking happy and wanted but every time i just see myself socially isolated and feeling that im doing something wrong with my life through all that time i lived in moscow despite my hope for the revolution and love to the hometown i always felt like i will have to move abroad somewhen soon on feb  my city lost it remainings of a liberal facade and i lost the rest of my hope facing z swastika all around and being on a brutally repressed protest i realized how brainwashed were all the people around me suddenly being turned into violent nazi with a single snap my country now is shamelessly committing it terrible disgusting crime which i condemn just to mention i love ukraine a much a i used to love russia and this war a a huge act of gaslighting still feel like a fucking endless nightmare realizing this wa time for me to leave i quickly emptied my cozy loved apartment in three day left everything i had including good career possibility friend my lovely plant collection and took a plane to dubai where my father wa relocated to now with all this emotional tsunami happening to everyone around he is going to divorce my financially dependent mother which i will seem to have to take care of soonim trying to complete my final bachelor grade remotely which take all of my time and resource including half of my sleep time i dont feel able to overcome social isolation or find any suitable job because i just sit around in cafe sticking to my laptop studying and building portfolio for the entire day straight just to come back to an empty studio apartment for some rest at night i feel too anxious and insecure to look for friend or relationship and im forced to stay paranoiacally closeted because here my orientation is a serious felony this all feel so wrong and fucked i hate every single piece of life im having right now and honestly feel quite guilty about that also i regret all the missed social opportunity i had because of my anxiety hope to manage through this hell be able to relocate for master abroad and build a new better life for myselfor maybe i just want to finally wake up somewhere in my early childhood feeling dumb and fucking happythank you,anxiety2167,ive been getting close with a girl a few month now and ive learnt through mutual friend shes interested in mei am considering asking her out but the problem is thanks to my crippling social anxiety i have very few friend which mean i rarely go out meanwhile she is a very popular person who ha  thing booked each weekendit feel like there an imbalance because while i always need to fit somewhere in her schedule sometimes  week ahead we both know im always going to be free and will basically come when she call am i in the wrong frame of mind to say that knowing she like me id hoped that maybe she would want to find more room for me in her life make me wonder how much that would actually change if we datedanyone been in a similar situation,anxiety2168,right off the bat i know what youre thinking and no i am not here just to get view on some shitty podcast i want to help people like myself im not doing this for profit notoriety or fame i started this podcast with the sole purpose of helping others with their mental health with tip and trick a well a some joke along the way to help lighten the mood i enjoy comedy and helping others so i figured this would be the best use of my timei wanted to generally know what others need help with i personally suffer from depression anxiety since the age of   now i have helped myself along with my very supportive parent and my loving girlfriend to get out of my anxiety and depression for the most past i still have some bad day but not a bad a i once wa i still struggle with this everyday and probably will for the rest of my lifei know what it like to be scared to be anxious all the time the sleepless night the im gonna end it all thought the shaking in my body from anxiety that i would be better off gonei dont wish it upon my worst enemy which is why im here i helped myself to get through it so i want to pas along the gift and hopefully help a many people a i canwhat are some thing that you guy need help with what are some common occurring thought for you what trigger your anxiety im just trying to get a general consensus of what people need help with a my anxiety wa mostly about death and very large social interaction and it most likely is different for youif this is against the rule i will gladly take down my post i just want to try to help others,anxiety2169,  how can the school understand my anxiety and not think im just being lazy,anxiety2170,it a celebratory post been dealing with social anxiety my whole life and it prevented me from doing a lot of thing and living my life to the fullest some time it been worse and others better a couple month ago i have started seeing someone for the first time ever and that turned into a relationship this made me realise a lot of thing  one is that no one care about me not having a partner before  a few people have come to know this a of recently  another being that not everyone is loud and extroverted and easy going and everyone sometimes feel awkward yes even to the point that they hide in the bathroom and desperately try to come up with an excuse to leave the event or conversation i might be the person that sometimes doesnt say a word during dinner but i will talk to maybe one or two people  on  afterwards my partner say they dont care if i am quiet it doesnt make me a bad person pathetic or disliked maybe a bit boring sometimes hahah,anxiety2171,ridiculous right maybe not i have had many breakthrough in my anxiety the last two year due to therapy and medication sometimes im sad that i missed out on experiencing my s but then i remember all the great quality that i have that are related to my sa i think sa ha given me empathy  even tho life didnt look hard on the outside it felt nearly impossible on the inside i can really put myself in other people shoe and imagine their pain because i have felt it and i understand how deep the rabbit hole of the mind go humor  i have over analyzed every situation to the point that i sometimes stumble upon the funny aspect of life too sa taught me how to use this muscle and experience taught me how to use it for good now i can see the humor in most situation and thats something i can share with other people i love sharing a sense of humor with people i think it one of the best experience in life  sincerity  i am not calm enough to think of a fake personality to show you i am only capable of being what i actually am and feel the time i feel a connection with people may be more rare but when they happen they are genuine many nonanxious type know how to mold their personality to the person theyre talking to not me nothing against the chameleon of the world but i think people who are sincerely themselves are also very special and valuable  thoughtfulness  i am overthinking while i wa overthinking i remembered some really specific gift idea that you might like lot of people dont enjoy their s for any number of reason internal or external what make it okay in the end is if you come away from that challenge stronger with an improved ability to experience health happiness and human connection this idea make me feel very positively about my life,anxiety2172,it like a nervous reflex thats super hard to control ive brought myself up to be like that to protect myself from rejection so with girl i cant keep eye contact for even a second even though i know she might be a little interested in me i always think that shes misjudging me thats brutal and thats why i always try to appear a uninteresting a possible but deep down inside i just wanted to at least try to say something but my anxiety wont let me and i dont know if thats good or bad because it could be that my anxiety be protecting me,anxiety2173,im  and unfortunately suffered greatly with both social anxiety and depression for most of my adult life a a result i feel a if i have completely wasted my life thus far the anxiety started in my late teen and caused me to withdraw from life and living and the depression soon followed and became severe over the ensuing year at best i wa able to sputter through life and basically just run on fume never excelling in any way or even really developing any hope dream or ambition all i wa doing wa pretty much surviving im  now and just feel really badly about my life and overall life trajectory i like to think that all is not lost and that i can sort of make up for lost time moving forward  but i have my doubt i never finished college i never established a professional career never married  no kid needle to say im not a typical  year old and i definitely did not live a stereotypical or emotionally healthy life it wa actually pretty ugly overall i wa only superficially happy and ok i wa able to function well enough in certain area so a to fool people into believing that i wa ok  but i definitely wa not im  now and not really sure what to do i feel extremely awkward and out of place and even embarrassed around most people because of my life history and current state but i do nevertheless still have a desire to fix or change thing im confused though living how i have been living is all that i know,anxiety2174,how do you feel the need for others despite of your anxiety,anxiety2175,why is every social interaction so weird and awkward im honestly shocked that i have friend every time i leave the house i make a complete fool of myself and wish i never went out and it set me back in progress i dont know why anyone talk to me at all im so weird and offputting,anxiety2176,im typically a pretty outgoing social person but postpandemic thing have gotten weird literally nothing ha happened to make me think that everyone secretly hate me but im frequently worrying that everyone secretly hate mei often suspect that my friend dont actually like me and i feel the urge to ask them point blank if were really friend after hanging out i start suspecting that i talked about myself way too much and wa insufferable and now they like me lessif im at socializing at work especially work dinner i find myself replaying every single thing i said afterwards and thinking that it wa probably the wrong thing to say and my boss judged me for itif im out with a group i dont know well i imagine theyre judging my word my clothes my appearance and that im not cool enough in group of friend i imagine that everyone else is closer to each other than they are to mei think ive always had some fear of being disliked but this is reaching the point where it souring at least half of my interaction i find myself wishing i could just shut up and not say so much stupid stuff trying to be funny or talk so much about myself trying to make a connection i just want to fade away into an inoffensive person that nobody dislikesis this social anxiety is there anything i can do about it,anxiety2177,just one year ago i started a course with the maximum enthusiasmnow im approaching the end and im looking forward for it to end i discovered that this type of job is very demanding for my social anxiety and the final work ill have to do for the end of the course is literally keeping me awake at night month before the event itselfit wa very disappointing to discover that and now i am confused i dont know what to do i am passionate about something but my anxiety is destroying me day by day,anxiety2178,i thought it would get better when i reached highschool but no my anxiety worsened i cant even go to school anymore

worst state of mind i stay in my room the rest of the day and play video game whilst listening to music all alone then i lie to my parent and say that im actually going to give school a try tomorrow before i cry myself to sleep then i wake up the next morning and it the same shit ive never felt more alone  friend dont get me wrong my parent love me and try their hardest to help me get through it but i have  motivation im not saying that im going to commit suicide but if a sniper silently executed me from far away when i wa walking outside one day i wouldnt mind,anxiety2181,wish i could do a single one of those without breaking down purely at the thought,anxiety2182,this is kind of a rantim basically ruining my own life with something that exists just in my head my anxiety is high whenever im at school and i dont know why i used to be afraid that i would become subject to bullying but ive been at my current school for several year and none of that ha really happened im a junior in high school with zero friend i mean i met this one girl quiet and doesnt look like she ha a lot of friend like me but i dont know how to talk to her or what to talk about i can say hello to her but nothing really progress beyond that stagei wa bullied a lot in middle school my self esteem wa essentially at rock bottom even though my self esteem is a little better now my parent have suggested that i go to therapy but i feel kind of ashamed to have social problem my dad said that if i dont do anything about my problem or if i dont try to talk to people then i will live a very lonely and depressing life i will have no spouse no friend nobody to take care of me when im old it depressed me so much there are people my age im  who are dating and then there me an awkward person who cant even make a single friend im ruining my own life i tell myself all time that i dont care and that i can be happy without friend but deep down i care a lot ive been to therapy before elementary through middle school i went to a girl social group where they would teach social cue and all the general stuff on how to socialize but im still incredibly awkward i mean i do pick up social cue but i have a ton of anxiety and fear which lead me not to make eye contact and initiate conversationi feel that medication would benefit me greatly but there a stigma around it in my family my parent definitely do not want me on any drug they probably think that i would abuse it and become addicted or dependent on them apparently my mom discussed taking me to a psychiatrist with my grandma and she my mom said that shes afraid that theyll put me on lot of medication not only for the anxiety i also show some ocd like symptom but thats a different thing i feel like medication is the only thing that would help me and im afraid to bring up my problem to my regular doctor,anxiety2183,my friend suffers from social anxiety and i told her about an idea i had for a while and she liked it but i wanted to know if anyone would find it useful you play an interactive story game in a mobile app put into different scenario some youd find difficult in real life and  you make choice dialogue action thought etc how you would in real lifethen it analysis you and provides positive insight amp suggestion back to you to help you build more confidence and positivity in yourselfis this something youd want or find useful,anxiety2184,although there are multiple thing that someone could identify me from i still contemplate wearing a mask when going out alone even when hardly anyone wear them anymore the thought of someone seeing me while im out make my anxiety so much worse my sa give me this disturbing feeling of being watched by at least one person anytime im away from home even just leaving to go to my car i feel pressured to get insade asap so that my car window might shield me from whoever may have seen me which is more likely no one at all it make me wanna wear a mask so no one can match my face to myself but nowadays wearing a mask somewhere make you more noticeable since it died out i sit and think about how even if i wear a mask id still be noticeable from other part of my appearance that stand out but for some reason hiding my face in public make it at least a little better i cant exactly put it into word atm so hopefully someone know what i mean,anxiety2185,hello firstly i would never of thought i would be here posting on reddit about this problem but after doing some google searching i feel like it the best way to hopefully make myself feel betterbasiaclly im  year old and never had a relationship in my entire life i grew up with severe depression and anxiety but ive managed to somewhat keep it under control now which mean i can go to work now without having all the horrible thought of getting through the day recently a new girl started and ever seen i laid eye on her i cant get her out of my head i spoke to her one time just to say hello and that wa it how is it possible that im somewhat obessed with this girl because she ha to be the most beautiful person i have ever seen and yet im too much of a nervous mess to even start anything i usually try and build up the condifence to say hello each dat but then the day end and i just go home sad because i knew i missed the oppurtinity again throughout the day i can see other guy also find her attractive then i feel like ive missed my shotthe main reason im posting about this here is because i notice she seems to look at me a lot at a distance because i also look at her but i try not to be creepy about it i walked past her a few time and she seems to hide her face and it just make me feel even worse because i dont even know what that meansim very shy and im getting vibe that she is too but it killing me coming home knowing i could of attempted to actually start a conversation but  week ha past now and it genuinely making me upset because i actually very much like her despite not even speaking to her beforei hope this doesnt sound crazy but just some sort of advice would be appreciated,anxiety2186,i suffer from social anxiety and treatment resistant depression since i wa  now  i went to see a

whenever i try not to look post up about social anxiety i feel much better i dont know if i should stop looking for other people experience with social anxiety because it also give me some comfort at the same time,anxiety2216,i dont know where to post this at so im sorry if this isnt the right subreddit for this a little background info i used to suffer from social anxiety during my teen year like not able to even order food naturally that i have to practice my order in my head like im presenting in class type of anxiety accompanied by stuttering and shaking even a i grew up it slowly went away until i dont feel nervous in social situation anymore im able to do thing confidently and assertively and it been a few year since my anxiety went away but something ive noticed is that whenever im working specifically just at work my personality change like im unable to be myself how im outside or at home the personality that i turn into is sort of like shy quiet though i am a quiet person and an introvert but the quiet that i turn into at work is quiet a in i dont know what to respond to my co worker or i dont know what to talk about with them and honestly i think turn a little meek or dumb even only on the outside cause internally im still able to see the mistake or anything thats wrong but id just stay silent and not because im afraid to speak up but i feel like cause im new at work and the others are more experienced than me so my opinion is worthless cause this is my first time working in this field i know this type of thinking is bad but i cant help but think like that when i go to work it automatic for my brain to just switch up so id like to know how to avoid this from happening or a way to completely stop this cause when i act like this i end up frustrated and upset with myself cause even when i know im about to make a mistake id just let it happen and not do anything like a dumbass and id be screaming on the inside watching myself make a mistake but unable to stop myself it is so frustrating and i think my coworkers are beginning to talk about me behind my back too so that make me even more sad and frustrated with myself cause i know that it stem from me and i genuinely think that it a form of anxiety but it only manifest only when im at work cause thats the only place im not confident of myselftldr i turn into a quiet and dumbass only when i go to work cause of anxiety i think id like to know a way to stop this from happening,anxiety2217,i cant stop cry can anybody relate,anxiety2218,anyone,anxiety2219,doe sa keep you up at night after

rn,anxiety2221,about  year ago i made a conscious effort to deal with my sa and it totally been worth it i use to have a hard time even talking to sever at a restaurant and trying to make friend wa impossible now i have a little to no anxiety talking to talking to stranger i even work a customer service job the problem im having is that i still have a good bit of social anxiety only when it come to any of my coworkers i feel a lot meeker and more self conscious at work then when im off the clock my coworkers have even noticed that i seem to be friendlier to the customer then i am to them i fear it caused some of my coworkers to see me a stuck up or standoffish im not sure if it fear of being seen a incompetent or just not adapting well to lot of different people all at once this is a problem because my future job will require me to work closely with coworkers in a creative way and i fear that will be extremely difficult for me because ill always be holding back is there a way i can ease these frankly bizarre remnant of my sa,anxiety2222,so for the last  job ive had i dealt with really bad anxiety that i quit which just started happening because i had a job where i really

something,anxiety2223,so i started university in september i am in a large group of friend but i struggle to be myself around them a im scared of being judged when i asked one of them if they like having me around bc i can feel awkward sometimes with them they said i should relax and be myself and then ill connect better with people i am now trying to be myself but my question is having known these people for almost month is it too late to make proper connection with them now,anxiety2224,so ive f been friend with one of my friend since middle school wevealways both been more on the shy side except shes way more extrovertedthan i am and ha an easier time having conversation with other people ourage last year my friend ill just call her blue from this point on to make iteasier to read lol blue and another shared friend of ours got their first jobsand started working regularly i wa a bit jealous of them because i wanted usto all work together but they got the job without me i ended up getting a jobon my own after that but the stress of socializing and doing the task wa toomuch for me so i quit i also realized that my main focus should be on mystudies anyways quickly the conversation in our group chat started to become heavily focused on their job and what crazy drama had happenedthat day at work i started to feel a drift from them because i couldnt relate toa lot of the issue they were talking aboutnow fast forward to this year and all of my friend are dating or inrelationships i dont have a problem with this because i think they deserve allthe happiness and love in the world however this creates another layer of notbeing able to relate to them especially blue i already have a hard time makingfriends so relationship for me are out of the question it really doe sucksometimes though because blue get countless confession of people likingher every day because she ha an entertaining personality i dont know how to relax in social situation so i end up coming off a confused or just reallyreserved and it hinders me from making connection with people she tell meabout her love life all the time but it hard for me to engage in theconversation because ive never experienced those thing myself so i can only give so much input it wa even worse when she lost her virginity because i didnt know what to say thenalso most of my friend have younger sibling that theyve had to help takecare of and that just naturally make them more mature im the youngest inmy family so i didnt have to have that level of responsibility growing upi feel like all of these thing and my lack of experience in them make me moreboring to talk to it like im always looked at from this innocent shy boringlens and i hate it sometimes whenever we hang out and the conversationdrifts to any of the topic i mentioned it always becomes awkward for mebecause i cant do anything but smile and nod i feel like im a weird teenageror something because i find it difficult to converse with people my age ingeneral i know this wa a bit all over the place but basically i just feel liketheyre more mature and have more fun thing going on in their life than mealso i dont know if i should hang out with them for our next planned outingits just so clear that we dont match up in personality or experience wise and idont want to embarrass myself again by having to be quiet during mosttopics my

playing some game to win prize i didnt participate in the first one but then they did the saran wrap ball game and someone told me i needed to play i agreed i wasnt too worried about making a fool of myself because i wa a buzzed a everyone else and everything is funny when youre tipsy lol of course i had to stand and play right next to my office crush of course i hate getting stupid crush that

up winning any money he wa disappointed to hear the next day when it came time to pay my bill i totally just blanked on what the process wa for paying in cash because id never done it that way before

like but i just cant bring myself to sing around anyone when im at home by myself i enjoy listening and singing along to music but if music is playing around other people and i want to sing i just cant i feel like i freeze up i suffer with social anxiety and can be quite awkward anyway and i feel like this singing fear just make thing even more awkward for me for example i dont go to bar or club with friend because everyone is able to dance and sing and enjoy the music and ill just sit there awkwardly doing nothing even though i want to enjoy it ive been in situation where ive gone to a bar with friend and just left straight away because i feel so awkward and feel like people probably think im weird another example is when im in the car with someone and theyre playing music and singing along and im just sat awkwardly feeling uncomfortable i wont even bop my head to the music but when im home by myself or with my sibling the only person i can sing in front of i enjoy the music and sing growing up i wa fine and never had this issue it been going on for about  year and now that it been so long i feel like people are so used to me being silent and if i wa to just start singing they would be shocked i wont even play music at home if my parent home it might not sound like a big deal but i just want to overcome it a it stop me from going out and being able to enjoy certain thing and when i do go out i just feel like im so boring because of it ive never met anyone else with this problem and ive never told anyone about this because i feel it would just make it more awkward for me ha anyone else gone through this or doe anyone have any advice on how to overcome this,anxiety2266,context today wa my m th session with my therapist f the first session wa the worst i wa shivering like a mad man i had no experience talking to girl my age and the fact that she wa attractive made it x worse but then it got slightly easier and easier every session the rd one wa the best one not that i wa comfortable but i did well from my perspective felt good by the end of ittoday though the therapist brought thing to the next level at first she gave me exposure task to perform through the coming week and yeah i already knew that wa gonna happen at some point but when she wa describing the detail of what i had to do and how i just felt scared all i could think of wa there is no way i could do that stuffafter that it got worse she suggested doing some roleplay with her right there and then and i just felt this sudden wave of terrifying level of awkwardness which then turned into all those physical anxiety symptom you could think of she noticed me trembling and sweating since shes aware of my anxiety symptom and tried to calm me down but it didnt work i wa internally panicking and kept trying to delay the roleplay exercise until it wa the end of the session but it didnt work so i asked her to please let u do this next time after a lot of convincing she finally agreedshe asked me why i wa being anxious in front of my own therapist but i couldnt answer i dont know why i just am im aware that she know everything about me and my life but that doesnt change anything for me i guess after getting back to my car i just felt so down and disappointed at myself it felt like therapy might not actually work for me or help me out like ill never be able to overcome social anxiety followed by me battling some self destructive depressive thought i dont wanna do those exposure task i wa given and i dont wanna go to the next session at all and be forced to do that terrifying awkward af roleplay exercise despite having bought myself a week to rehearse or whatever it doesnt matter i just cant do it ever fml what should i do feel like no one can help me and no word would have an effect on meps second language english speaker,anxiety2267,removed,anxiety2268,i told her i had an anxiety disorder during the whole conversation i had with her made no

i gave her my money i feel like im being ripped off,anxiety2269,guy i need help how do i get outta school on thursdayi have extreme anxiety i wa diagnosed with it in therapy i took when i got bullied at my old school she signed me off when i found i got my place at my current school i havent seen her since she didnt say i have extreme anxiety but i have a thousand different anxiety i googled it and google said the symptom i have is a sign of depression but i dont even think i have it i dont wanna go to therapy because i told her about some other issue apart from issue i have apart from the trauma i have from my old school she gave me advice but i didnt tell her all thing that traumatised me because i didnt feel comfortable sharing stuff with her there some stuff i will never feel comfortable sharing with people because it too traumatic for me to talk about with anyone so i prefer just to keep it to myself and the main reason my mum took me to therapy wa because of my trauma at my old school anyway the little advice she gave me it worked for a few day but after a while i wa back to my old habit i dont open up to anyone from my family i dont really open up to anyone at least not very truthfully well i open up to my absolute best friend sometimes but it so limited ill open about how bad my day wa at school she open up to me a well she make me feel a bit better but like i said it very limited so not much it so fun to help her though it hard to open up to my family my family treat me good  i love them so much but it just hard to open up to them i promised myself not to step foot in therapy because it hard to open up to anyone and her technique didnt work i only just got worse again this maybe triggering to some people that take therapy sorry but on tv not including the movie reality tv documentary and all the therapist say the same thing it much easier to tell random stranger on internet because i dont know you in person im probably opening up to you more than my family and friend but see it still very limited anyway enough about this the reason im telling is just for backstory so you can understand a bit better not that you know me and that but yeah  i just need some advice if you canso basically i wa sick all week this week i had the week off school this week i felt like i wa dying i spent three day in bed i felt happy i enjoyed playing on my tech i also felt no stressed apart from recovering yesterday my friend told me i wa reading joke in front of the parent because my teacher want u to do something for christmas for the parent to get in the festive spirit but i am festive but like it hard for me too it i feel like im gonna have a panic attack next week i can just feel it i sometimes fake sick sometimes it work sometimes it doesnt but i wa genuinely sick this week on nearly recovering i just have a very snotty nose right now so im worried she might not believe me because i wa sick this week i know most of you will say dont bunk off school but my anxiety is  right now i cried over it i want my mum to come because that will make my anxiety worse im hoping she wont come because i dont even like reading it to other parent  ive always been shy in doing thing like this i really cant do this im not even funny im  but i have  year left yet im scared going into the real worse lot of people call me lazy i dont wanna go to college im very dumb i cant do it they dont understand how hard it is for me to socialise i stay inside all day every day most of the time and my mum want me to go to college or get a job so she can go out because she go out when im at school because she know i hate going out i have epilepsy and seizure so it hard for me to stay home alone in case i have a seizure i understand my mum want to go and her freedom but it hard for me to socialise i get all flustered and i could have a panic attack i know i didnt tell my mum but im scared to tell her my feeling so i know what youre thinking how do i expect my mother to know if i dont tell her i dont know what to do i feel uncomfortable and scared even writing this post but im desperate like i keep saying i really cant tell joke on thursday in front of people i cant even tell my mother not to come because the last time i told her not to come to anything like this she got offended she didnt come but i felt super bad about offending her i love her so much but like i said my anxiety  right now,anxiety2270,after a conversation ill often experience intrusive thought that go something like thiswhy did they laugh when i said x wa that a

awareness that you all have to express what wa going on with me when i wa  back then i wa just trying to pretend like i wa normal when i clearly wasnt and if someone said i wa shy or withdrawn id be deeply embarrassed even though it wa so obviously true i really put the extrovert on a pedestal and couldnt understand why i wasnt like them in my s i went through the motion didnt lose my virginity until  didnt have a bf until  but once i did all of my friendship disappeared so i had almost no social life outside of him for most of college then came alcohol problem to hide the constant pain tension and loneliness i bottomed out on alcohol in the year after graduating college and did the aa thing which wa actually tight because it is a supportive environment structured specifically for people with good intention but serious mental baggage it wa another like  year of trying more of the classic advice get hobby do well at work be healthy etc thing were getting better slowly i made some new friend got back in touch with old friend but everything wa still just so tiring i always felt like i had to hide the real me i felt like i wa in constant danger of being found out that actually i sucked i got in a new relationship at  and my anxious attachment style started ruining an otherwise perfectly good thing i dont say all this to freak anyone out im just trying to say ive been there i wa almost  when i finally started therapy and medication over the course of just a few month my life got so much better i wa suddenly reacting to thing like a normie i could see another girl get hit on by a guy without spiraling out of control over what wa wrong with me i know right embarrassing i could show up consistently enough in friendship to start forming more meaningful bond with people i could have pleasant interaction with stranger without being completely overstimulated at  i feel like ive truly been living life these past two year for the first time sometimes im sad about those year that i lost to social anxiety but at the end of the day i have really fallen in love with who i am and i wouldnt be who i am if it wasnt for that time i think i have many beautiful

have a breaki dont know why i am like this i feel like this unless im very close with someonei cant talk to anyone without overthinking and trembling i dont even know how to put my thought in this post without it being a mess ive always had a history of struggling to express my feeling or thought so sorry if this post doesnt make any sense thing are always disordered when i try to express myself it like a block in the middle of my head when i talk to anyone all i think of how boring i am and how out of place i am with them i wa in a group of three once and ive noticed how both of them sometimes dont reply to me at all lol these type of situation always encourage me to give up morehonestly even the thought of posting this make me a little anxious maybe im just not used to being out there i want to talk to people but im terrified ive recently developed a hobby for learning language but i am not sure how i will improve if i dont talk to anyone who speaks that language i think my age also play a big factor of my anxiety when i talk to people im pretty self conscious about my age because people dont take  year old seriously and would probably be le interested to talk to me the only person i talk to everyday is my partner but it doesnt actually help my social anxiety it also get lonely knowing that theyre the only person i talk to haha i want to be able to make friend and talk to people but at the same time i just wanna hide in my room and be alone since when did my social anxiety get this bad i look at other people and always thought about how they manage to socialize and have fun if someone were to come up to me and crack some joke i would freeze up and give the fakest laugh i have trouble understanding joke sometimes and that make me feel really out of placeive always been so awkward and anxious my whole life i dont know what to do ever since i wa a little ive always struggled being social on par with other classmate and that really discouraged me to talk to others ive tried getting into vrchat before but i didnt fully get into there because i couldnt find anyone whod be interested enough to talk to me one guy did but they only spoke portuguese and i ended up running away i feel so bad for that lol my experience on there so far told me that it not really the best place to socialize despite it being a social platform unless you bring a friend with you im so tired of my restless thought i hope i dont find myself deleting this after a couple hour lol maybe i need therapy but even the thought of that give me a heart sinking

anxiety for over an year now and ive been seeing progress in myself ive noticed one thing in particular and it that my personality ha been a bit off lately it feel like im developing into something more like a person after  year of isolation due to covid etc i felt like i lacked idiosyncrasy and lost my sense of self however it been getting better due to an increase in social interaction i feel like im finally moulding into something genuine and have a real personality with real opinion people know how i behave and how i react to thing it like ive become more predictable rather than people being completely clueless about me everyone around me isnt afraid of making joke and im able to laugh thing off however sometimes i do end up being pretty awkward since i dont think thing over multiple time before im going to say it additionally my action have become more instinctive and im able to say thing more naturally and my reflex action have improved for anyone who struggled with their own sense of self and identity i promise it not you you are a unique individual and social anxiety is just an incredibly painful and difficult thing to deal with on a daily basis everyone out here is super brave for living with something so debilitating it doe and will get better overtime,anxiety2305,hey thereim suffering from treatmentresistant depression and social anxiety for more than  year now have been through probably  med ssri snris atypicals tetracyclics tricyclic opipramol mirtazapine even neuroleptic diazepam gabapentinoids and  therapy  depth psychological  cognitive behavioral one all without any success i really dont know how to live on like this everyday is a big sufferingmy doc wanted to try me on lithium next and i wa wondering how worthy this is i think lithium might be another type which might be good because a my failed treatment show depression might maybe the wrong diagnosis maybe i suffer from something completely different add possible to due to my cognitive symptom but no doc wanted to test me on that yeti can think in my past about a lot of crazy stuff i did always under influence of something really thing i cant think why i have done them and are crazy when i think about them which is what i can think of why some people get lithium formy question is anybody here who had success with lithium for depression social anxiety or mental health itself after failed treatment is it a possibility i really lost a lot of hope since all these failed treatment for year so i thought about just giving plain supplement a try again or get on lithium maoi is still another option but doc ignored that for now only one available here i parnate add med and add ha been ignored for year hard to get it diagnosed when adultwhat wa your experience with lithium positive a negative how long doe it take until first significant effect occur what would you describe the effect like what change did you notice re mooddepression anxiety social

feminism homosexuality politics and normal ethic in general my roommate is very traditionalist believing woman should stay home opposing lgbtq etc which im fine with i dont ever feel like telling people what they should or should not think but i never stop from sharing my own view when questioned we always have this cycle where he keep pestering me about joining his religion which im normally very calm about but after a string of thing he say which i simply do not want to hear i go on to explain there are certain thing i simply dont agree with and im not interested it go to a point where he shift the focus of the conversation from trying to preach to becoming extremely defensive everytime i try to explain my view he completely ignores it and just keep on pestering like ill somehow just become a devout muslim if he keep telling me how wrong i am we get high together often and he tends to let his guard down and be pretty honest when he high yesterday he told me you know people who had an abusive childhood like yours tend to grow up to be very weird and autistic but youre definitely not that you turned out pretty normalthat really hurt me i didnt bring it up with him later but ive opened up to him in the past and he used this against me i would brush it off by telling myself he close minded but im pretty sure he said that from his hearthe laugh at literally everything i do he think im weird cause i like to take my time buying grocery which i assume he think is for woman to do his mom sends him his grocery weekly he think im an asshole cause i disagree that woman should be able to go outside whenever they want he ha the audacity to tell me im not being a proper brother to my sister he say i should tell her to not have any female friend cause that apparently ruin woman every time i state an opinion i used to consider normal he act like i said the funniest shit in existence i feel like im being gaslit i am questioning myself right now whether im actually too annoying about my view but it so difficult to sit silent after hearing these blatantly nasty stuff constantly tbh im older than him and i want to cry right now he even us the fact that i told him

mental abuse from my mom i knew my mom wa not a good person to me but didnt know the extent of how it effected my behavior until recently i think the reason why i tend to cower in front of stranger or

coworker and offer to get officemates something one asked for a latte the other just a large ice i forgot the large part and came back with something like a medium only for her to yell about how that wasnt what she wanted i should mention that she is not my supervisor in any way and that task like going on a coffee run arent in my job description at all i wasnt going to say anything because shes always pretty abrasive and i usually just let it go but idk maybe it because i didnt  have the best day at work after that morning for unrelated reason but im thinking about texting her to explain that i didnt appreciate that im sure she wont take it to heart because she hasnt when other people have done the same thing and shell almost definitely talk about me behind my back so im wondering if

frustrated a woman walked next to me let just say that i might have kind of tackled the poor lady luckily she probably wasnt hurt and she did not fall on the ground after repeatedly and awkwardly

world,anxiety2322,i went to the doctor today and i really wanted to bring up my anxiety issue to them but in the end i bit my tongue and couldnt bring myself to bring it up it honestly seemed like the dr didnt even give a shit they didnt make me fill out a questionnaire or even ask about any mental health issue during the checkup the checkup literally only lasted about  minute it also didnt help that before my checkup i could overhear my dr outside talking with other nurse and joking about other patient it kind of wa off putting and made me even more anxious to bring up the issuei really dont know what to do at this point my anxiety definitely is a burden somedays but then other day it like im completely fine and i think to myself i dont need medication it sort of like a domino effect

used to work with in the pub and i have not exactly parted on good term with some of them so i spent most of my evening trying to avoid them thankfully only one person recognised me and it wa someone whom i only met in passing at a previous workplace so no bad blood theremy group went outside to the smoking area which is an improvement a my headache caused by the loud music went away and we can finally hear each other except that it freezingi usually sneak to the toilet or go outside to get a bit of fresh air and let my ear and eye rest a bit everyone keep asking if im fine i explained why i

twitch to everyone and thats terrifying then again if i wa just streaming on twitch casually itd be okay too so maybe it the idea of being evaluated being tied to memy faceonline presence that make it so terrifying i dont want to do this but maybe ill be disappointed either way maybe ill regret not doing it but honestly i dont remember the last time i wa really disappointed after skipping arent you supposed to feel regret after you run away from thing like this i just feel enormous relief and a bit of shame but not enough to truly feel regret im probably supposed to feel excited about being part of this but i just feel inevitable dread of let get this over with already and i dont want to go into something with that energy it doesnt feel right putting my part convo here in case this resonates with anyone part  if it not mandatory i wont do it part  other people would be happy if you did itpart  but would they if they knew it wa torturing me so much part  it your fault you procrastinated on what to say until the last  hourspart  please can i just rest after being sick all week and having a six hour long stomach pain part  isnt that just an excuse though other people are in pain too and you didnt have to go to the er so it wasnt that bad and it not like youll just stay in bed and rest you might want to do stuff part  i wa  am still sick i dont want to do this i feel like my leg are going to give out  part  i dont think it a good idea to decide something out of fear if youre not excited about it youre not excited about it and thats okay there will be other opportunity to do thing and youll feel enthusiastic and right about them dont force yourselfpart  youre just running away you always do this you make excuse youll never do what you want in life if you cant do something this small with no consequence part  it not small though i havent had to do a truly public performance where i felt this unprepared in like maybe  year and back then i wa peer pressured part  so you wont do anything unless youre peer pressured part  yes at least when im this unprepared it feel that awfulpart  isnt like the entire goal of the class to be okay with being unprepared youre just showing how cowardly you are by not even respecting what youve learned from the class part  it not cowardly to say yes ive been sick since monday with a stomachache been so exhausted i slept at pm had a migraine for  hr felt so nauseous i didnt want to eat then had almost ovarian cyst rupture level of pain today it okay to want to rest after that part  ha ha ha you always exaggerate you would have felt relief if you were still in pain huh then youd have permission to not do this pathetic and you thought you could do this part  i dont want to argue anymore im not doing it part  it tru i wa looking forward to it until literally today but it okay to change my mind when circumstance change it okay for me to not force myself thats not how i want healing to go not the example i want to set for other part and you know it set me back day with fatigue afterward no matter how well it go and yeah maybe i wont write the best  i cant do this  email or whatever but i still tried my best to make it work and i cant control my body and being sick i know bravery mean to you being able to push through anything do anything you want but the truth is i dont want to barrel through anymore not unless i absolutely have to bravery to me mean coming to term with the part of myself that other part might find embarrassing or shameful or humiliating and accepting them even if other people might judge me or not understand i loved being in the class and i will always treasure that i dont have to show that by being part of the performance part  youll hurt people if you dont do this you know that right part  damn i wish i could have started on this earlier i wa looking forward to it etc etc still hiding under the cover feel so ridiculous but sometimes this is just how the brain is i guess want that

much to say my social skill seem to be in the gutter and i cant feel much connection to other people  still i really enjoyed my date and wa fun talking to her and getting to know her she seemed like a really cool person but it felt a little distant she asked me to be in touch but i dont know if she said it just to be polite or did she actually enjoy it tooi have somehow arranged another date for tomorrow and am feeling excited about that one too and a little anxious kinda crazy how my firstever date are backtobackjust feeling a little down after the date feeling like im so boring and

usually forcing me to avoid people with i am not very close but today when i saw her i decided to talk to herwe talked only for short time but it make me feel little better about myself,anxiety2343,i am good student and i try not to hurt anyone my class mate wa thinking i am a good person  after a short period they start to give me those angry look and idk why even though i am at the same behaviour from the day  with them,anxiety2344,removed,anxiety2345,i think this is social anxiety and i dont know if i am being paranoid or it legit  i need painkiller and do buy over the counter brand not often but enough to be considered that i use them mostly  lucky if i take them more than once a day  however when i go to lloyd in particular which i have been for year once every month maybe it always the same judgmental stare like i am breaking the law  then the question then the  if it doesnt improve you will need to look into other medication   to be honest i just think no doctor is going to give you this this is why it over the counter so let cut the crap this is a business and the doctor dont want the hassle and rightly soi can walk into a shop and buy  two bottle of vodka and get no question i could do it daily and would only get judged but no one asks you  why you are taking it  and if you drink more than the recommended amount per week you must feel ashamed  now i know the difference here is alcohol over the recommended amount isnt a bad a paracetamol over the daily amount but i never do that  so i feel ashamed embarrassed when buying them  i see them go and talk to one another probably saying  we know this guy face he a loser a junkie shame him tell him he is not being a good humanits a legal drug very legal and it my life please i appreciate and would talk a to why i use them but dont whisper at the desk with someone else making me feel ashamed  it wa month ago i wa there so so what if she recognises me i am not breaking any law what so everi also dont drink either i am fairly healthy and i am here because in my head here is what i think  they know my face think im a loser  ill be reported to the police  they will shame me in future  they are bad mouthing me judging me behind my back  they ae taking a photo of me and sending it all over the country so no one serf me againits impossible to live that way i just want to live my way without anyone judging me,anxiety2346,everyone always talk about how life get better after high school but for me it gradually getting worse i graduated high school earlier this year and i still

job this is possibly the worst time in my life and the most depressed i have ever been,anxiety2347,this would be common for you social anxiety sufferer out there if maybe you havent heard of the

thinking like am i the only one who find it rlly embarrassing awkward and hate having to think what to say i can never really be my authentic self anyway hence why i said it just the bare minimum

university a ive been trying harder to engage others ive noticed a of late that it seems everybody ha a hard time taking the first proverbial step simply saying good morning or hello usually strike up a full conversation and ive even noticed that these small initiative make others feel more at ease being the one to initiate conversation the next time before i would sit solitarily and hoping others would approach me now i am instead getting approached since ive broken the barrier and taken initiativei urge you to atleast try this maybe dont expect a full conversation immediately but just saying hello can make people take note of you in a way they wouldnt otherwise,anxiety2357,big match tonight and wa wondering if anyone would be interested in chatting while watching the match id be

into a panic attack and now i cant even look at reception everytime i get in  hey it been a long battle trying to live with social anxiety but i felt like i had had a lot of improvement this year when i started college the attack i used to have almost every week had subsided to every few month or so and i felt like i could control my spastic thinking when around people a little bit better  anyways with that said i hadnt had an episode since july until earlier this week im an art student and in this particular day we were trying to get a project that involved a cdrom that wasnt working for anything in the world and we already had to scrap  cd and keep getting out of college to buy new one only for them to not work either and our presentation wa in le than an hour it wa pure stress i proposed myself to go buy a new one at that time but to get out of uni we need a card and mine wa in my bag which wa in the other uni building very far off you can also scan a qr code in your phone but mine wa also in the bag i then took my friend phone to get out and make thing quicker since we really didnt have time i ran off scanned his phone ran to the store bought the cd and when i came back his phone had locked itself  i didnt know his password shit  without any form of comunication i had to resort to asking the receptionist for help i explained the situation she asked me to give my student number so she could solve it and i did after that she turned to me and said very harshly well ill be blocking your number now and also your friend since you got in with his card now youll have to go talk with security and hopefully unlock it you shouldnt have done this  i wa fucking petrified she turned to the other receptionist and said oh they got in with their friend card and she looked at me with such contempt i very sheepily said sorry  you knew that it wa wrong and you did it anyways huh  at this point i felt my eye watering and my heart begginning to race i hate being yelled at i said sorry again and that i didnt know  well darling now youll have to go through this and at least i hope not do this shit ever again  the other receptionist turned to me i felt so ganged up on  she sighed with annoyance now ill have to go get your little friend to come here where is he  i told her the room and off she went to get him to come at this point i wa trying so hard not to have a breakdown the stress of the project and now this situation out of nowhere and being treated like a child who got in trouble instead of an adult absolutely sent me over the edge  i said look im sorry we were just rushing with a project that wasnt working and i needed to be a quick a possible  she interrrupted me with well you were trying to be quick but then you fucked it didnt you  that wa it i couldnt hold it anymore i walked to the door and tried to hide the fact that i wa now sobbing the other receptionist came back with my friend and then i couldnt disguise it anymore i started to intensily sob and hyperventilate like i hadnt in month i mentioned inbetween sob i had social anxiety and she saw shit got real and took me to the firefighter station that is inside our uni she wa still trying to justify her scolding all the way there but at this point i really wasnt listening i wa too busy trying to gasp for air  after she went away i got to rest and compose myself and the firefighter lady wa very nice in the end the project worked but yeah it wa a horrible experience everyday i get into the uni now i cant even look towards reception because im scared of them,anxiety2360,how weirdcringe would it be if i send a classmate the link to the avpd very similar to sad and write i have this when he seemed interested in talking to me but my avoidance confuses

tough time at the minute and would really appreciate some advice from people who have gone through or are going through the same thing ive just come back from my first term at university and am feeling really negative ive always dealt with social anxiety especially in the last few year but am feeling down because i guess id hoped to make a change in a new place instead i could barely hold conversation with people unless id had something to drink and havent really made any proper friend since starting the group i met at the start of term who i initially made an effort with have become really close and most people have found their group im only invited to thing out of pity the best i can do is tag onto people when im drunk however the drink ha caused big problem and led me to do dumb thing so i really want to quit it also majorly distracting me from schoolwork which is important to me i think the social anxiety ha been triggered by some environmental trauma people being mean and im also gay but i also sometimes have a feeling that my brain just feel broken anyway to cut a long story short im having a dilemma about either going on med ssri or taking a more natural route im already doing cbt i know they say take small step but the only problem is i dont have time im off for two month perfect window for ssri and i cant afford experimenting with small step next term  due to the importance of making friend however im really worried about the effect of ssri especially since one of my main enjoyment at the minute is writing fiction  for which brain function and emotion are essentialany advice would be greatly appreciated ,anxiety2364,for the vast majority of college my class were online due to the pandemic so i never really got to meet many of my class mate only

another city and im very nervous to go a lot of people who are pretty outgoing for some reason intimidate me however i really want to experience this a ive never had a graduate ceremony of the scale

on earth for me i get extremely introverted during the gifting session because all i think about is how to react when opening giftsi guess i am afraid of hurting people who spent effort into buying a gift wrapping it and sometimes writing a little poem it a thing in the netherlands i dont understand why someone would spend time and effort to gift me something but i am very grateful for it i do not like being in the centre of attention and i dont know how to react i feel like my lack of display of enthusiasm could hurt people while on the inside i am happy with the gift and with the love but i dont know how to show itdoes anybody feel the same and maybe have some advice on how to cope with this,anxiety2369,hi so i always had social anxiety and im introverted person that made me avoid

trouble,anxiety2372,ive tried it all and this helped so much it dissolved the pent up delusion i had in my head that everyone wa judging me i learned people do not give  shit what you say or do really in fact theyll even like you more for being vulnerable and being yourself even if youre not perfect because hey who is the comedy class wa  week with about  people in the class the first week everyone just got on stage and said their name and a couple of their favorite comedian it wa terrifying in the moment but that whole day i felt lighter the next week everyone threw some material they had at the audience everyone doesnt laugh at everything and that wa ok the third week i felt more comfortable and by the th week i felt alright on stage much better than the first time like mile betterat the end of the class we did a show for almost  people i did  minute of material on stage and it went mostly well but it really like almost physically showed me that people do not give a shit and it is all in our head lol no amount of thinking or therapy could make me feel this doing this comedy class and show made me feel it it shattered my delusion and i feel my sa is probably down  no joke i know it sound super scary but i cannot express how much this did for me this is basically exposure therapy on steroid lol but man ive been feeling so much better since the show i just wanted to share what do you have to lose it is scary yes but it could be the thing that allows you to feel that people dont care,anxiety2373,im prescribed asneeded benzos i take them very rarely it mostly for

heartbreakingi cant even explain exactly why it just make me realize how much i am hurting how much i never get to be that version of me without the baggage on top around other people i want other people to be able to experience her then i feel like i could make connection from my soul not from this persona that my trauma molded to keep me safe i want that more than anything else in this life,anxiety2374,to preface i did not like my personality in my teen i wa rude arrogant and sometimes obnoxious but i had so much confidence i could talk to almost anyone and be my authentic self which is different and much le judgemental now whether it wa speaking to people i had romantic interest in or just other kid my age i had  anxiety i remember i used to be on the school bus in freshman year and would yell question out to the entire bus wa it obnoxious yes but i wa confidentobviously apart from the confidence my personality wa awful i had a small group of close friend but the vast majority of people did not like me a they thought i wa some combination of rude weird annoying and just generally unpleasant i started realizing this near the end of sophomore year and decided to change my personalityby senior year up until now in my early s my personality wa completely different i wa much more pleasant and polite and can have an engaging conversation with most people if they start one with me but i have no confidence i almost never approach other people to talk and although i have do have great conversation with people it is almost always because they start talking to me i feel i have crippling social anxiety now that i want to get rid of i went from being the center of attention a annoying and obnoxious a i wa to always being the quiet one who kinda keep to himselfid love to combine that confidence i had from  with my current personality a i find it very hard to just approach people and start a conversation even when i know theyd like me and have approached me beforeis there anyone who been through this i feel ive internalized my people pleasing and not wanting to be seen a weird or disliked like i used to be to the degree that i prefer to just be quiet and out of sight which instead of people disliking me make me completely not on anyones mind ideally id like to be completely outgoing again and well liked instead,anxiety2375,anytime i do something that requires more than  of my focus my heart literally raise x sometimes it can go a high a x it irritating a i cant do anything for a solid  minute i get shake and my mind race into oblivion i feel

relief a much a i can slap a smile on my face day to day and pretend like im totally fine no one can even imagine the hell on earth we have to face all the time i wish sa wasnt such an almost

nothing to lose and a lot to gain she can feel uncomfortable and the interaction may have a poor costbenefit ratio for her but i dont careproblem my brain is making me feel fear im sure if i wa a psychopath i would approach her even if it made her feel uncomfortable id laugh at her and everyone else and walk away with a puffedup chest and a feeling of pride and grandeur i envy psychopath so

people sharing class with them being in club with them yet never making that many friend the few friend i made all came to me first  extrovert who adopted me into her friend group and  fellow sa introvert like me when they both left i wa basically alone for the rest of highschool whats crazy to me is the fact i spent  year with like  people and couldnt form one friendship by myself i started a job recently and realized it been  or  month since ive been working there and i havent made any friend besides this  girl who wa also an extrovert that adopted me i introduced myself to everyone but starting a conversation for me is a recipe for disaster so one coworker ha already labeled me a someone who doesnt talk to nobody im ngl the only reason i got this job besides money wa to put myself out there and learn how to break out of my social anxiety and social awkwardness so im still gonna try my hardest to figure out what is the cause of my awkwardness just the fact that people in my old highschool established friend group in a couple month and here i am at my job struggling i realized ive formed a defense mechanism for when im in a social situation where everyone is talking and i have nothing to input because im overwhelmed i just zone out and block out everything until i can leave the situation i just dont understand how people do it im jealous that they dont have this level of anxiety and i wish being social came easy to me so so so bad,anxiety2385,i struggle with social anxiety have been since i wa a kid i find that in many situation i tear upcry and it can be from any emotion when im laughing a little not even when im laughing a lot and it would be expected when im mad sometimes randomly i got bullied for cry a lot when i wa young and ive tried to stop this tearing upcrying ever since because of how i wa made fun of and how people bring it up normally im in college now and i started texting with someone and one day when i wa walking to another class and i walked past them i overheard them talking to their friend about me and laughing and for some reason i cant stop thinking about it usually i just forget about it ever happening the problem i have now is that whenever i go into a large public setting it make me think of that moment and i start uncontrollably tearing up what can i do about this do other people have this issue,anxiety2386,i take mg by about noon during a stressful work day i feel my anxiety starting to creep up eating help a bit but im wondering if maybe a b complex or something would help or something else,anxiety2387,like not opening up much not sharing much beyond surface level etc ha it ever happened where you felt like you lost a friend or pushed someone away because of it,anxiety2388,hi so this is my first time here and i really could use some advice im  and taking the act on saturday for the first time i am autistic on top of also having severe social anxiety and ive also been homeschooled because of this for the last  yearsi am currently in therapy and use cbt but i honestly dont know what to do at this point i cant pinpoint exactly why people scare me so much so it hard to correct my thought i am honestly so scared i cant even imagine myself getting up saturday morning tmi im sure most people here probably understand anxiety effecting their stomach and it already bothering me doe anyone have any tip for this,anxiety2389,my face get red when im anxious or uncomfortable or caught off guard and everyone always point it out and it make me feel really bad about a year ago i started wearing foundation to hide it i hate the way it look so much it make my skin look textured and slightly yellow even with the closest shade match im really pale and so i have to wear a lot of it to hide the redness i have always loved eyeshadow mascara lipstick and other makeup but foundation make me feel so ugly i take it off a soon a i get home from school if im feeling more insecure than usual i just dont understand why people have to point out that my face is red it so embarrassing i wish i didnt feel like i have to do this,anxiety2390,only mention highschool a thats forced exposurefor me having one on one conversation with people is very difficult after awhile i just zone out sometimes and struggle to keep conversation going rely heavily on the other person to lead conversation  split,anxiety2391,i have such intense social anxiety no matter where i goi feel a though i am being judged i am scared to say anything in fear of being judged by someone but then all i think is that they are going to think im rude standoffish and that there is something wrong with me i would love to do more with my life but my social anxiety is like no i used to not be this way which make it more frustrating well i had social anxiety but i didnt really care what random stranger thought about me,anxiety2392,i recently spoke to my therapist about how i feel really shy when speaking to my dad before i decided to speak about this i realized that i wa always uncomfortable around my dad but i love him i love him so much that it hurt and while i wa talking to my therapist i realized that a reason why i am so shy around the him is because of how much i admire him i am a very oblivious person to my surroundings my dad is the opposite it something feel like he know everything but he also hard to talk to for me he unpredictable i dont know how he will react to thing or well he make me feel vulnerable i dont know how to explain it he care a lot about image and how everyone always look and he just so i dont know but i can never be like him i just feel so small and useless in front of him and for some reason he think highly of me and he sometimes tell me that im smarter than him which is hillside and untrue im just mad at myself become if my dad knew how shy i feel around him he would be devastated and that im overthinking everything i just talking to him give me social anxiety the same feeling i get around most stranger i dont want to feel that way around my dad i want to fix it but i dont know how i guess im just scared doe anyone have any advice,anxiety2393,i overthink every single interaction if the person doe a little a squint their eye midconversation and look to the side i will extrapolate hundred of possibility each one draining mei enjoy socialising and having people who i support and who appreciate me but i am hyper agreeable and despite being extroverted i  feel the need to just withdraw from the world once a fortnight and not speak to the rest of the civilisationi then overthink thing about other people even when i am by myself so it feel like i cant escape it through socialising or  avoidance it ha been this way for many year and i dont like spending hour having my headspace consumed by people thought and opinion of me doe anyone have any advise to break out of this thought pattern eg similar to cbt pattern recognition something that ha worked for them etc ,anxiety2394,hello everyone  m here im just wondering if anyone can relate to this back in my senior year of high school i didnt know who wa going to be in my lunch period so instead of going to check i just decided to hide in the bathroom during lunch i did this for most of the year and i honestly enjoyed it more than sitting at a table during lunch it felt nice to get time to just be alone during the school day still whenever i thought about why i wa doing it i felt sad i once got caught by a teacher when i wa in the hallway and she told me that she saw what i wa doing and it made me feel so weird i kept doing it but steered clear of wandering the hallway ha anyone else ever done this,anxiety2395,ive had social anxiety a long a i can rememberi have tried so hard my entire life to change it medication therapy exposure meditation exercise ketamine anything and nothing ha helped me overcome i have finally tried to stop facing the thing that scare me and i feelhappy like staying at home and never leaving is fine with me but now leaving and doing thing that i used to be okay with doing scare me i feel like i am developing agoraphobia and it scare me,anxiety2396,i am in need of some positivity and im sure some of you are too anyone wanna share some positive experience that theyve had recentlyi briefly had to present for a group activity at work with only a few minute notice and while i wa very nervous and i didnt make much eye contact my voice didnt go all croaky and i wa understandable,anxiety2397,for my theater class we had to perform a dance with a song of our choice we had to memorize the word and lip sync them during the performance so my group chose jingle bell rock because it easy i wa away from school wednesday because of my dad having surgery so i didnt get to see the majority of the dance because they finished it that day i get there today and i say i dont know the dance because i wasnt there so we rehearse for literally  minute and after that they didnt care they just played around the rest of the time we had to practice before we performed even though i kept asking for help because i couldnt memorize it so we get up there to perform and i dont know the dance at all i had to look at the people next to me to even do it it looked like shit i also messed up my partner move because i didint realize our part wasnt over to make it worse because i wa so stressed i forgot the most important part the fucking lip syncing so i wa just dancing without singing it thats the whole point of the assignment in the first place omfg so im shaking by the end of it and my teacher tell people to give criticism and every single person target me because i look like i dont know what to do because i donti get back to my seat and im on the verge of tear because im so nervous and humiliated and my friend decided to come up beside me get my attention then splash a bottle of water into my face so then my face wa all wet and everyone started laughing at me and i wa trying to hard not to cryi literally ran out of the room immediately when the bell rang i dont want to go back to that class im thinking about skipping tomorrow,anxiety2398,every once in a while i play an app game with my friend like never have i ever or boomit especially boomit cause a lot of anxiety a one person judge which statement applies to another person i dont know if i am the problem but i always feel that the remark that are made about me are the worst therefore i hate these type of game because they force you to judge everyone else and yourself i just dont see the fun of it but my friend like it so i just go a long with it maybe it is just me taking it too seriously but i only get anxiously knowing how people think about me,anxiety2399,m im very shy and never talk to people when people try to talk to me i get really nervous a im not sure what i should say so i respond with yeah or ok and just look to the ground i look away because eye contact make me nervous i dont want to make people uncomfortable by staring at them is it rude to not look it people i never look at my roommate even when i enter my room and we never talk dis i make it hate me with my fear of looking at people how do i fix this,anxiety2400,so my anxiety ha been through the roof lately about an interaction i had with an acquaintance of  year from my neighborhood normally i wouldnt be affected a much since this person isnt really a friend but weve crossed path on many occasion and have had multiple small talk type of discussion throughout the year whenever weve seen each other on the street or elsewhere this person life a few house down the street from me and we usually discus our young kid who are similar in age who will occasionally play together in the park when they see each otheranyway i bump into this person again at a local gym and we do our usual small chitchat then out of the blue she asks me whats your name in front of me and my spouse and im totally caught off guard ive known her name probably since we began conversing year ago and probably even referred to her by name at some point im like uhh my name is   give a nervous smile and i try to act cool about it but at the same time im confused a hell how this person would have no idea what my name is or even if she didnt know my name why she would even bother to ask right there in that moment honestly it make me feel really insignificant since this interaction ive questioned if im just a nobodynoname to others around me a wellmaybe it my own culture but if it were me not knowing another person name i would never ask them so bluntly like the way she did with me which i found rather rude for her to do in front of others a well i probably would just avoid bringing up that person name i didnt know and just use general greeting like hey or if i needed to refer to this person i didnt know by name id just say something like oh thats ltkids namegt mom but i cant fathom admitting to another person who name i didnt know by just asking them so bluntly like thisor maybe im just being overly sensative to this all,anxiety2401,i wa going to do exposure and i had no intention of doing somthing bigger than what i had planned but the thought came anyways and i thought about it for so long and i always thought in the back of my mind ill never agree to it i wont do this and i wa right i said i cant and i wont donit but then i thought how proud of myself i would be if i did it and i got so much inspiration i actually said you know what ill actually do it and i wa on my way but then the smallest thing got in my way at the last second and i automatically turned around without thinking like a cat seeing a cucumber i noped the fuck out and went back to the original plan,anxiety2402,i keep driving to the parking lot and turning around im too scared but i really want to challenge myself ugh,anxiety2403,i did exposure but it went wrong it wa a little embarrassing but i acted fine and handle it well surprisingly also i acted right surprising  time now without awkwardness in the last week only been doing exposure for a month and im starting to just act right no awkwardness or not knowing what to do just coming straight into action and i wa fine no panicking at all but for some reason after about  min i started acting all weird and awkward maybe i felt i didnt get away with it or that i cheated them and maybe it felt like waiting for punnishment or somthing because they were taking to long and i wa waiting with only my thought maybe it went well and i wa anxious about leaving quick so i would not fuck it up actually im pretty sure thats it whenever somthing good happens i want it to end so that i can call it a good dayexperience,anxiety2404,i dont know what to do my social anxiety hold me back so much from enjoying life i dont talk to anyone in school besides  people and dont play sport because im scared i will mess up and get made fun of but i know im good at the sport but i just cant stop overthinking it and i get even more nervous when it the opposite gender im  btw,anxiety2405,i cant afford a dr at the moment so im just trying to gain some insight and ask question and learn from others experience im  but have struggled with these since i wa ive never known how to express thing like feeling or emotion i always assumed people would just know somehow what i wa thinking i dont know how my word affect others i can read the vibe of a room but i overthink it and then i cannot read it anymore and misinterpret people reaction when i make joke i feel like imbejng rude but i never intend to be im always trying to say the right and correct thing in convos trying to be the cool guy but so far ive only failed and come off a cringe and weird which only made me try harder at being cool but it kept backfiring and now im here with a identity crisis and also not knowing how to act and behave so i took on behaviour of people around me and from movie i cant keep conversation going for too long when there banter i dont know how to keep it going but when i watch friendly or flirty banter in movie and stuff it seems to easy but i cant replicate it in irl i can easily pick up sarcasm for the most part but when the sarcasm is pointed at me often i cant tell if the person dosent like me and is avoiding me or what in that case i just leave and avoid it all incase im making them uncomfortable i dont have issue with sensory or noise stuff i dont think i have any repetitive behaviour like tic or stimming i dont have any specific skill i have no skill actually just average at anything i doi also have great difficulty in understanding concept without example or someone explaining them to me when i read about politics and history and there  opposing party i cannot for the life of me tell who is right and morally correct and who is wrong and evil if that make sense,anxiety2406,it hit me suddenly every time when i realisei am not very close with my extended family which is not because of them altough some or kinda homophobic but rather because of me that i dont wanna open up and be me trueself because i dont want to ruin the climate of the familybut sometimes i think of my grandma who is very nice kind and liberal compared to some other family member sadly i even have severy anxiety around here so im not even able to tell her all the thing i think about herthen it me how cruel would it be for her when some day she pass away thinking her grandson doe fine and is just some weird fuck who cant even talkit hurt me that i am like that but telling her the truth could hurt her aswell i imagined scenario where other family member would call me out on what i wa thinking burdening her with such thingswhat do you people think telling the truth with risking that she would suffer under it like my mother seemingly doe or just dont say anythingit really frustrates me,anxiety2407,i am alone but want to dance but to scared to go first to dance ,anxiety2408,sometimes when im asked an unexpected question my brain seems to deliberately block out any relevant information preventing me from responding im left staring at the ground panicking even if it a basic question like what did you like about x or why did you choose y my mind just go completely blank when i do manage to conjure up an answer it usually a jumbled unintelligible mess i end up slurring my word and i speak in a slow monotone voice all while avoiding eye contact it hard to have an engaging conversation when this happens im afraid i give off the impression that im disinterested or that im not paying attention and it make me feel terrible and stupidwhat am i supposed to do in those moment i could ask for more time to think but it seems like the longer i sit there the harder it is for me to piece together a coherent sentence on the other hand i cant just say i dont know because then theyll either think im an idiot or i dont want to talk to them  i do take propranolol and while it doe relieve physical symptom of anxiety it ha no effect on my ability to recall information in these moment,anxiety2409,last night wa our christmas happy hour not something that happens often it started at  but i had a appointment and couldnt get there til  it at a bar right next to our work when i walked in everyone wa had showered changed and dressed nice and i wa still in work clothes still smelled like work too we are all personal trainer at a gym when i walked in no one really greeted me they just made a bit of space a they kept talking there wa some basic greeting but i basically sat at the corner of the table of  and just listened i wa so fucking painfully aware that my half of the table had been in a conversation when i arrived and i brought a cold silence when i sat down i could feel it the awkward energy my coworkers carried on conversation and they asked me a question every now and then to include me after answering politely i would fall back into silence then it happened one of them asked me if i wa ok and another spoke up and said yeah you seem upset or anxious i tried to laugh and said dont call me out like that im trying my bestthey didnt seem to expect this answer i had broken some kind of social code they said something about it being a long day and i looked her right in the eye and said i have social anxiety she got all apologetic and said youre doing so great and i just nodded and said it all goodthen i quietly died inside all night i could feel the space between me and them they all just flow together carefree thoughtless conversation meanwhile im filled with a physical anxiety and painful knot in my gut ive got nothing to say it wa a painful reminder of me being different for a good few month now ive felt pretty comfortable in my job ive been making connection and building relationship in context of my work personal training but apparently when the mask come off when im not in my narrowly defined role when it just humantohuman bonding and conversation i falter and fail it wa so obvious that they asked if i wa ok i seemed visibly upset for context im  and a fit lb no one expects me to have these problem i feel like im six inch tall,anxiety2410,do you live in the same house a your parent or alone or

that day my dad picked me up from work today and when i got in the car i wa tried from work and really not ready to go out and shop i know i shouldve said to him that i wasnt ready to go out and shop for mom but i felt i had to say yes and it not like i dont love my mom and dad it just that i be ready to do thing and then my dad make it a big deal and get all pissed off for no reason when im

issue i get worked up then visibly anxious at which point people stare etc once it begin it doesnt stop and i have the choice to either expose myself totally embarass myself or retreat reinforces negative coping mechanism ive tried a dozen psychiatric med for this ive tried not giving a fuck it doesnt work benzos help but you know the story muh addictivei refuse to believe this can be overcome with positive thinking or therapy im not a stupid person i would have managed to cultivate some kind of reasonable coping mechanism by now at  if such a thing could be achieved i need an effective medicine not some bullshit ssri and subsequent gaslighting by professional when it again doe not workits not a matter of putting this to one side and living in spite of it the possibility of what life can be for me are diminished to almost nothing because of this i dont want to live anymore with this illness im too old for this i cant see a way out other than suicide,anxiety2416,ive had social anxiety my whole life f but the past  year have been so much better it mainly because of work ive been at the same company for  year  we were only  but then got acquired to  there are office all over the country but my location is mostly the former company people the reason i mention that is because u in the core group still reminisce sometimes and get together at work happy hour im usually one of the last one to leave because im either chatting or playing a game with someone i open up we joke around and i dont have a huge issue i used to which is becoming red and blotchy when i talk to people ive been comfy and i like them a people  well there a reunion party this weekend where people are even flying in to attend and i wasnt invited it silly for me to feel this way but im pretty crushed for this to be hidden they must have created a separate slack channel to make sure i didnt know about it office event are discussed in the main one and made sure not to talk about it when i wa around the reason i know is because my husband is friend with a former coworker who in town and said he couldnt hang out because of the big party that daytoday i passed lunch room and overheard one person ha a voice that carry so i heard them talking about it this wa the twist of the knife because now i know that almost everyone in the office wa invited not just the reunion employeesi used to think that when people were nice they were actually lying and didnt like me now i realize that i wa correct and should have left them alone and not attended other activity and be annoyingbtw there a way to not invite someone in a way thats le cruel   hey this is probably something you wouldnt be interested in but some people are getting together at x this is not an invite but a nice way to let me know and not make it awkward when people talk about it in the office after  there will be a party at x so let me know if you want to stop by again not an invite but a kind way to exclude someone that you dont want to be thereit would be bad for everyone  including me if i were invited and no one wanted me there but it so hurtful to be deceitful about iti wish they would have given me more sign throughout the year that they didnt want to be around me i dont think ive ever been this embarrassed i spent year not knowing that i wasnt welcome it mortifying,anxiety2417,im the one who fumble when speaking

cope with my anxiety while working so i wa explaining stuff in class today and doing my hand motion again a combo of excitement and trying to cope with bad anxiety and a kid chimed in with ever thought about being a conductor i guess because of the hand motion not gonna lie i laughed but then became very selfconscience i know this student like me and didnt mean anything by it but damn my colorful way of teaching my main coping strategy well shit,anxiety2485,im in my first year of high school and even though it been like  month ive only made one friend theyre pretty much the only other person with sa at my school everyone seems to be super extroverted and i would say their sa is worse than mine for context i go to a private school where everyone had to do interview and a lot of stuff to get in so i guess it make sense that nobody ha sa anyways because of my sa ive been too scared to do sport which everyone seems to do at my school and it make me feel like a complete failure i go to school miserable and wait desperately for the day to end and then i go home and wallow in self pity i just dont want to be so lonely anymore and i want to hang out with a group of people rather than just one i dont even really like hanging out with my friend that much and i know i shouldnt be judgmental since i also have sa but theyre extremely awkward and being around them make me feel lonely and empty sometimes on the other hand i cant really imagine myself becoming friend with anybody else at my school since theyre so different from my friend outside of school and i dont think anybody else ha the same interest a me the club at my school are pretty shit too theyre really disorganized nobody take them seriously and they dont acknowledge new people i just dont really know what to do and i dont know if i can go on for  more year like this id really love to hear if anybody ha had similar experience so i can feel a little le lonely also advice would be much appreciated,anxiety2486,ive been dating my gf for  year and she know how bad my social anxiety is she know i make a major effort not to interact with anyone anywhere and to never leave my house unless i can make sure someone else interacts with any other human that we might run into today she told me to just stop be being a fucking pussy and deal with it it obvious after all these year she just doesnt understand the shit inside my head that keep me from enjoying life like she doe im thinking of just breaking up with her tbh lately there been a lot going on between u so i wouldnt be suprised if we just stopped talking to eachother but it still extremely depressing to think about i dont know if i can be alone again,anxiety2487,i have reached the loneliest and most anxious point in my life so far ive been at home for a month after quitting a job i havent seen the outside except to take out garbage and peek out my window sometimes just to imagine taking a walk i live somewhere where activity is pretty close by and yet i am too afraid to go out for anything my only friend left me out to dry and i feel hopeless i feel like a freak ive been working in restaurant a a cook i enjoy the work but my comfort zone isnt doing me any favor if anyone ha taken the leap for a customerfacing job how ha it gone for youbtw i know suggestion of going out for a club or volunteering are common but im not going to attend a socialthing if im not obligated to like a job ,anxiety2488,im a little bit nervous i really wanted to be on the ball in doing whats good for my mental health and refraining from what i know to completely fuck it up leading up to my first day but i didnt do that at all im not in a terrible place mentally but anxiety wise ive definitely had better day doubly anxietyinducing is the fact that i need this job atm so im just really worried im going to fuck up somehow and have a breakdown or something good energy though i wont have a breakdown and everybody else working there is probably just going to be focused on how much they hate their job or when quitting time is or maybe theyll just be chill people idkwish me luck,anxiety2489,it kind of blew my mind it made me realise how much i avoid thinking about unavoidable thing like getting old and dying and that there a possibility that the loneliness will never end and it could go like that until the end,anxiety2490,hi ive been struggling with social anxiety most of my life but this year wa the worst it feel like im going through puberty again ton of mood swing and depression where i want to kill myself im so mad that i have anxiety and people on tiktok say that they have social anxiety but seem to have friend and live a normal life me always in a fight or flight mode having to overthink every situation doesnt have any friend or support i really think they are lying but back to me i wa in a positive mood early this year but went down a the year went on slowly going from happy to depression and this year i lost  pound but depression gained back  pound so whatever and now i have been trying to cry to make myself feel better but i cant because im not sad im mad im mad cause im not normal im mad that i dont have friend im mad cause i have no support im having panic attack were i get angrier and angrier were i feel im going to hurt myself or someone else,anxiety2491,i bit off way more than i could chew a a starbucks barista i just cant do it anymore i dont know what to do ive heard of people working overnight in stocking and everything but i dont wanna fuck up my sleep schedule like that i just dont know i feel completely worthless because i cant keep a normal job,anxiety2492,so i used to be terrified to go to the grocery store the one i wa going to wa quiet calm not super busy and had everything i needed i went once a week and wa terrified every time a year later i moved across town and started going to a different grocery store this one wa much busier louder and much more fast pace this also made me very nervous to go to here the twist though i tried going back to my old one after a while and i wa calm relaxed and ha almost no anxiety this shocked me i think whats going on here is that before i moved any grocery store wa a huge fear i hated it thought about it had negative thought about it it wa the worst part of my week but then once i went to a more stressful store the old one wasnt the most stressful thing to me anymore it almost became irrelevant i started having thought like i enjoy this smaller quieter store more than the loud busier store i started having more positive thought about it that specific store i think my point is if you hate something it make sense why you avoid it and youll probably hate it and avoid it until you do something thats even worse or more stressful and then that old thing seems easy if you want to build muscle you dont add lb to your weight and expect to get stronger youll just injure yourself you add  then add another  and continue until what you used to do seems too easy,anxiety2493,anyone with social anxiety here not finish college or h,anxiety2494,i wa offered a promotion at my job yesterday and declined because i wa afraid of the stress it might add to my current workload i feel like a failure and i could tell my bos wa disappointed i wa proud of myself because they chose me over everyone else but at the same time i knew i would be overwhelmed and my mental health come first i dont know im just venting here,anxiety2495,so this ha happened twice now and i have a theory hear me out this morning i had a super engaging intellectual discussion with an xbox friend of mine where i wa able to actually articulate my point and had him thinking about my response it went on for like  minute and i actually made sense the whole time  i didnt stumble through my response or sound like a complete dipshit even once and then i started to shake like teeth rattling trying to keep my voice steady shake wa this an adrenaline dump like a fight or flight type response i think so,anxiety2496,ive been struggling lately with loneliness im  and havent even had my first kiss yet due to social anxiety and being an introvert i dont really do much to give me a chance to meet anyone i find it incredibly difficult and embarrassing to do thing alone ive tried dating apps and cant bring myself to message anyone i see couple in public and it get me pretty down on myself i just want to feel a connection with someone i just feel like once someone know this about me they wont stick around i feel like such a loser sometimes and i just want to get out of this rut,anxiety2497,when im with a group of people and everyone is joking with each other im always sitting their quiet and feeling anxious i get afraid that i might say something offensive and ill say something thatll make everyone think im weird so i just dont say anything but in turn i get labeled a being a weirdo anyway sometimes i just feel incapable of saying a word especially when i smoke some weed im the same way when i go hang out with friend and i feel their slowly distancing themselves from me what

i thought i wa really excited for at first my professor personally emailed me to ask if id interview for a job at his company and i wa really looking forward to the opportunity however a i wa preparing to answer interview question today i just felt like i couldnt even convince myself it wa a position that wa meant for me and a time slowly drew me closer to the interview which i originally thought id totally nail total anxiety started taking over i couldnt stop cry out of fear and i wa asking for encouragement from my mom and my husband but i just couldnt do it no matter how hard i tried i even went to clean up my makeup and throw a coat on because it started to feel like id be a failure if i didnt just suck it up and go but then i started thinking about it again and i just couldnt and by then it wa too late so i sent a lastminute email apologizing now i feel like ive let everyone down and wasted everyones time which im sure i have and im so mad at myself that i couldnt just do this simple thing i had promised to and i wasted my whole day on it while disappointing people every time i think my social anxiety isnt that bad ill go and crap up something like this and be back to square one,anxiety2501,it ha worsened since the beginning of this schoolyear probably mainly because my best friend doe not go to same class a me anymorei am very athletic i play guitar and i have good grade at school i think i am pretty average looking a well at least there is nothing outstandingly ugly about my appearance i usually talk with the cooler kid in my class and they talk to me a well and i like talking to themso everything seems really good about me and i should be feeling confident but the problem is that im not feeling confident at allmy dayin the morning i hate my look especially my hair i try to make it look better but i still hate itwhen i get to school i feel really alone during break even though my friend are sitting right next to me because i cant ever think of anything to talk about with them i guess we have different interest to some extent they like partying getting by with studying a little a possible driving car etc which are honestly not my interest at the time during lunch i usually sit alone and then some random people are going to sit next to me a people come in i dont speak to anyone even though i see the same people around every daysometimes i sit with my friend when it look like there are free spot at the table but i usually dont because i feel like im too boring and maybe creepy because i cant really think of anything to say during a conversation in a group besides im eating the whole time so i dont even really get a chance to speak anyways even if i had something to say i feel like they already are mentioning all the partsviews of the topic so i dont have anything to addhowever i really like to be able to talk to someone during the break it literally make my day if someone talk to mein the evening i actually like the way i look appearance wise but i hate the way i act everything should be fine why am i being such an idiot and a wimp that i just cant make myself talk to my own friend and sit next to them for lunch even though i like itso i really dont understand myself at all whole thing is also being made worse because i cant run which is my absolute favourite thing to do a im injured i havent been able to run for a year and before it wa one thing that took my mind off my horrible social skill and all the other thousand thing i worry about but i dont even have that anymore running ha been the only goal ive had in my life so right now i see no point of existing at allby contradicting myself i meani like to talk to peoplemy friend and i want to talk to them but i feel like i dont deserve to talk to them and theyd be better of talking to someone else insteadi like the way i look in the evening but hate my look in the morningi think about all of this during the evening but in the morning i dont think that much of it all until the evening come again and i get depressed againthis ha been my life for past month and i dont know if im able to change for the better at all honestly i feel like it a matter of time until my friend finally stop talking to me and im going to be alone for real,anxiety2502,i feel like no matter the situation i am always a complete mess when around people whether i just met them or i already knew them it just feel like i always say the wrong thing which i realize after and it make me feel so embarrassed afterwards,anxiety2503,anyone else burnt bridge with

her on delivered on more than one occasion when she asked me to hang out trust me i know it rude of me and i feel horrible about it one of my biggest fear is letting people down but my anxiety is the

speech and meditatingaffirmation do you have any trick to fight this fear thank you,anxiety2507,i have anxiety disorder quite obviously lol but i want to know if there a logical explanation a to why i suddenly gain the courage to argue when it about something im passionate about ie personal trigger of sa term human right etc i end up overexplaining and it becomes extremely difficult to just drop the topic for me i would hate to be on the receiving end and im so worried that this will be the downfall of all my close relationship because i cant prevent them from having these discussion with me but i do know i can control myself i just cant help but like start getting into this rapid elongated explanation doe anyone have any advice on how to overcome this is this even related to my anxiety or did i just anxiously convince myself that this wa anxietyinduced,anxiety2508,thave this weird repulsin to people who follow the rule i know it wrong and theyre probably way better people than me

appear relaxed then approach the person with some enthusiasm say  oh wow thats a really nice shirt hat or haircut or ring or whatever i like how the color go so well together give off a good and friendly vibe  ive been looking for a gift for my brother or father or cousin or friend i think this would be great for them ummm can i ask you where it fromps change the gender accordingly refrain from saying something like thats a nice green blouse a it brings out the hazel speck in your eye too much too soon for an initial contact ive had lot of luck with making connection with this method it is a compliment and it show you are lookin closely enough to notice id advise you to try and do this to  to  guy or gal who you are not interested in at all at first and then to the people who you are interested in doing so help you to gain confidence a well a it make the other person feel so good  be genuine and be patient with yourself,anxiety2523,i have social anxiety and i often dont interact with the people around me i want to change this yet i struggle to care about anyone enough to want say anything to them and when someone try to communicate i often just get annoyed or shut down the conversation asap is this something you experience a well is this part of the disorder or could it be something else,anxiety2524,so when im with someone friend boyfriend and they interact with and start talking to a stranger like in a shop or at the bus stop or something i get really really uncomfortable like second hand embarrassment for them because im over thinking and scrutinizing their action and word a if they were my own i get extremely uncomfy and mentally freak out but there nothing i can do about it i cant exactly say hey can you not talk to people youre embarrassing me that would be horrible and i know that theyre probably not sayingdoing anything wrong and that i only feel like they are because i would never speak to stranger because i dont know how but all these feeling and fear seem to follow through to whoever im with i dont know what to do about it or how to explain it to anyone without insulting themdoes what ive tried to explain make sense,anxiety2525,yesterday i had my first try at therapy it wa online audio i gave him a specific issue and example but he kept shooting wide asking about other stuff i know he maybe have a reason for it but i couldnt react with it i gave him nothing he kept asking and i kept giving him short answer and i kinda felt him getting irritated one thing i know i dont know how to talk about myself even if i know what to say i it doesnt make into word and my mind blank one thing that annoyed me it felt like he memorised some scientific solution and kept saying you should follow these step and we will see progress and when i hinted that i tried something familiar and it didnt work he got very defensive and didnt even ask me about what it wasampxbanyway im proud to finally try it but it not going to be easy to get somewhere,anxiety2526,i take bupropion this help me feel le tired and more motivated but my anxiety might be a little worse because it help me being le unmotivated and lifeless therefore whenever im anxious and insecure i care more about it if that make sense im going through a lot right now im dealing with a breakup while having no friendship the winter drain me and i recently started therapy for my sad and low selfesteem which is useful and necessary but also very draining and confronting yet i dont want to run away from my problem anymoreive been wondering if taking an ssri would be beneficial for a while but im scared to ask my psychiatrist ironically i dont want to become numb or expect my anxiety to be completely gone but i hope it might take the edge of the intensity of the anxiety and fear of rejection maybe that make it easier to notice when im overthinking and stop myself if im not a overwhelmed even if it subtle if you have any experience id love to hear about it,anxiety2527,for this context in setting it to text since im way too anxious to even talk to new people face to face i feel like i can only touch surface level for most topic and i become really boring to talk to and like i just dont know how to continue a conversation like most of the time my conversation topic just keep changing because i dont know how to continue like i cant properly have a conversation with others especially woman since my only interest is football which i talk to my guy friend alot i dont know what to do im like so boring ,anxiety2528,after the rare time that i am around someone im comfortable with and i have a good social experience i realise that this is what it like for non anxious people all the time no wonder people like socialising so much human are designed to be social,anxiety2529,i have the feeling that my social anxiety make me talk only about myself whenever i have to talk to some new people and that i completely forget to interact with them or ask them about themselves which make them hate me right from the start and i just realize that after,anxiety2530,i wa bullied in the past when i wa in middle school so now everytime i see some group of people of my age around whether it is in the bus in the coffee shop or in the street im starting to panic and im getting so anxious that my heart rate get faster and i want to leave the place always have the feeling they might be talking about me or mocking me,anxiety2531,i have seen many motivation and heard a very good advice  that being too nice with people make them abuse you i think socially anxious people need to live with the phrase eye for an eye what do you think,anxiety2532,ive had social anxiety for a long a i can remember but recently talking to people face to face ha become a lot easier possibly because of the antidepressant i wa prescribed a few month ago online however it seems nearly impossible to keep a conversation going let alone start one i feel like i just get too much time to overthink what im about to write and i just give up doe anyone else have this problem this is my first post on reddit because of this exact problem figured this would be a good subreddit for taking that first step,anxiety2533,i recently checked into my city mental health crisis response centre and my stay caused me to miss some day of work since ive returned to the office it seems like people are avoiding me normally i would enjoy this i prefer to keep to myself but this is deliberate and offputting my sa make it hard tell if they are uncomfortable around me or if it my workplace social anxiety making up for the missed day however the stigma of mental health challenge is alive and well in society despite what any employer say they are doing about it,anxiety2534,ok so this is sort of a followup post to my previous posthttpswwwredditcomrsocialanxietycommentsxjaqvyoumissoftheshotsyoudonttakeitookutmsourceshareamputmmediumandroidappamputmnameandroidcssamputmtermamputmcontentsharebuttontldr i asked a woman on the street for her number but she turned me downor so i thought today wa the first time we met again and she came up to me and gave me her number thats great rightwell today wa another first the first time i had a driving lesson with a particular teacher again there wa an interrim period where i had another teacher but now it back to this one i had previously always felt like cry after his lesson but this time i went full panic attackidk if you know what i mean but i wa barely keeping it together a i had previously done to find a safe place to break down this wa my first panic attack in over a yearanyway i wa in this state not quite keeping the tear back and this is when i had the encounter with her she hugged me twice gave me her number and i went inside to surrender to the emotionskinda weird though i have never laughed during a panic attack this wa definitely one of the weirdest cocktail of emotion i have ever experiencedfuck me life is absolutely absurd and bizarre what are the odds of this happening i have no more wordsanyway wish me luck i will message her tomorrow,anxiety2535,i think of starting to roller blade because i want to start a new hobby  but just the thought of being at the skatepark with other people and having to interact with them just scare me there so much i wanna do but my anxiety amp awkwardness stop me from being who i want to become it ridiculous what are some way u guy control your anxiety,anxiety2536,i am lucky enough that with my current level of medication and lifestyle change i can hide it well enough i have worked super hard and long to get the right combination of medication and dont want change that,anxiety2537,this is more of just a thought the only thing i can think to make me more confident would be knowledge i suppose for in knowing is knowing how to put forth into action i suppose for some odd reason gi joes knowing is half the battle always come up in my head on a daily basis im not the most educated and im stagnant from working all the fucking time in fact i have to get up early for  hr of sufferage today confidence within a man show manhood frankly i dont have much of it and it feel overwhelmingly difficult attempting to come off a if i do you couldnt pay me the greatest rich to go out and just be confident a weird a this sound id love nothing more than for someone whod want to motivate and teach me thing within the confines of a relationship im not saying theyd have to teach me how to be confident or baby me like a pussy maybe something toward a new career perhaps i can handle being wrong and

been a sign somewhere saying which entrance to take but i only have  second of strolling past not staring too intently to make that decisionthen i decided id grab pizza  i go to the cafeteria and

about si and i going far from home for study dosent help either  ive got really bad social anxiety i go blank when teacher talk to me infront of the whole class im okay talking one on one but not with so many eye looking i could request them to teach in english but im not sure how the other student will feel about it im pretty sure they are comfortable with the class so i really dont want to be the

mention they can discus at length meanwhile i dont understand a thing and oftentimes just mind my own business to say the least i always feel left out and it ha translated to them also leaving me out naturally talking amongst themselves in a circle literally while i sit outside wishing i could be in on the convo but knowing all too well i have nothing to contribute this dynamic ha made me feel comfortable being the observer but it frustrates me all the same i do want to say more i do wish theyd get to know me better but i feel like it too late   contrary to my peer im just someone with  a bachelor who happened to make the cut to work with these smart people though im in the process of applying for graduate school for c i really dont dabble on any technical hobby on the side i do a lot of artsy hobby and it more mentally relaxing for me to do when the work is done i find that coding more in my free time burn me out and i dont want to do that to myself occasionally i will read up about science and tech but for the most part i do other thing not tech and so i bear the consequence of not being able to relate to my peer on top of already being anxious about how to converse with themive thought of dabbling on more technical thing for the sake of workplace friendship but i feel like i would be forcing myself to be something im not i love tech which is why i work the job i do but i also love the art and other form of entertainment and how i go about my day to day working tech job and drawingreadingplaying videogames is my routine balance i talk quietly for the most part and i listen more than i talk but even when i talk loud enough to make a comment crack a joke it seems like theyve mentally gotten used to me not saying a thing or not hearing me well and so they dont reactacknowledge what i say most time and im left talking to myself in relation to this i dont make a peep when it come to brainstorming they all talk over me and i just shrink it really weird i used to have lot of friend i wa once boisterous loud shameless but i moved to the u lost contact with all my friend and experienced solitude and culture shock big time i always thought i coped well moving to the u but looking back i really went downhill socially i can count my friend to date with one hand  i dont know what happened to my extroversion im still stern i can still be bossy i can still be assertive but i havent had the opportunity at work to let those trait really shine through and so everyone assumes im quiet socially awkward and shy and in essence there is some truth to this impression but i wish they could see my other strong trait a welltoday i left work early because they were huddled in a group chatting about a project they clearly have unanimously agreed i have nothing to do with even though im the main dev for the project i wa too sad to sit through it i dont know i hope it get better,anxiety2584,long story short im supposed to have a speaking test in a different language tomorrow it worth  of my grade in this uni class it making me so anxious i cant even think about it or look at the excersises im supposed to be using without starting to shake and cry  if i go and try to do the test im definitely going to cry during it and my mind will probably go fully blank and it going to be extremely embarrassing if it wa just me being affected by this i would just skip it ive done pretty well in everything else so losing  of the grade while it wouldnt be good wouldnt kill me or stop me from passing but it a partnered test if i skip it ill be putting my partner in a bad position because theyll have to unexpectedly be partnered with the teacher which is probably way more scary than being partnered with another student shes also autistic and doesnt like plan change so id be pushing her under the bus in that way too but if i dont skip it im going to be a blubbering mess ill embarrass myself even more and ill put my partner in a bad situation anyway by making her and the teacher feel really awkward during the test i dont know what to do,anxiety2585,i can see how this could be really helpful and i think im going to try it doe anyone here have experience with using improv comedy classesgroups to overcome social anxiety if so would you recommend it,anxiety2586,so i have this coworker that work in a different department so we dont work with each other too much but when we do i can sense a feeling of a grudge from her and whenever i pas by her or whenever we both see each other she seems like she doe not want to say hi to me or anything and in my head i am thinking what did i do wrong i guess one day when we worked with each other meaning she wa my team lead for the day and i guess she wa being friendly to me but i guess i wasnt when we first met i wasnt too friendly to her i guess nor i wa talking to her that much just to clarify i am a shy person when it come to meeting new people and if you were to see how i look i would not look like the type of guy to be shy i am a pretty big dude that is  and i have a resting bitch face a well so maybe that probably threw her off thinking i am an asshole i dont think i am a rude person i just focus on my work and normally i get stressed out a lot at work so that probably make it worse i think we both got off a bad start because every time i see her she look at me and i look at her and i just look away but thats because i am pretty shy and socially anxious around her and i feel like when i do that she think i am being distant but in reality i am thinking that she hate me i wouldnt say i am rude but i can understand why people think i could come off a rude since i have a meanlooking face and a big physique a well  i am too scared to talk to her about our situation so i just ignore it and neglect it i would say hi to her every now and she would do the same but my anxious thought are telling me that she is only doing that to be nice and i would start overthinking about why would she be fake nice to me when in reality how am i supposed to know if that is true i then would ignore her and not say hi anymore because in my head my anxiety would tell me that she is only a fake nice person and that i should not deal with people like her so i would ignore her and become distant towards her i know it only a job and coworkers are not your friend but i think i got confused by her or maybe she got the wrong impression of me,anxiety2587,hello everyone i just wanted to share a little about myself and what it like having social anxiety so here we goim a yo male ive always been a shy person but i can be social if someone seems interested in me somewhere along the line probably in middle school i started to become self conscious and had a hard time making friend i also began using porn a a coping mechanism around this time which i feel only contributed to my awkwardness high school wa better because i had one close friend and other people i enjoyed being around but i wa always alone on the weekend and never hung out with anyone outside of school at the time i felt lonely but never felt any desire to ask people if they wanted to hang out it wa kind of weird i guess i wa too worried that people would judge me if i asked them to hangout and so i never did of course i also enjoyed being alone and still do but there wa a lot of missed opportunity because of me placing my time alone above time with others after graduation i had no plan of going to college and just worked and that wa it those few year were very lonely for me because i isolated so much and had no one to hang out with then when i wa yo i decided to go to college it kind of laughable but my main reason for going to school wa to try to make friend because i wa so lonely the degree wa secondary and that first year wa rough because at first i didnt think i wa going to meet anyone there but the second semester wa pretty great i found several people to hang out with in between class i did a few thing outside of school with some of them like going to the gym or grabbing a bite to eat and it felt like thing were working out for me i even asked out a girl for the first time that semester i still dont know how i found the courage to do it lol and it didnt lead to anything but i wa proud of myself for trying then the following year i decided to make the move to main campus i wa feeling brave and confident in myself and wanted to experience main campus life so i moved there and i wa very nervous and doubtful that id ever make any friend but on the second day of school i joined the dodgeball club and my life changed from that point on in a good way  ive met some great guy in the dodgeball club we have a lot of whipping ball around lol i never knew about college dodgeball but it real and it the funnest sport ive ever played we travel to nearby school and play in tournament against some very talented team it so much fun but it only because the guy on my team make it feel like family it sound cheesy but it like weve always known each other anyways if it werent for dodgeball i dont know if id still be in school  year later thats the only reason im still in school at this point i lost interest in my major because i lack confidence and my major requires a ton of confidence i didnt even have the gut to try an internship to at least get a feel for the career so here i am in my fifth year of college with no clue what to do i can only play dodgeball for so long until i have to call it quits the guy i started out with will be graduating and moving on soon speaking of them i havent actually hung out with any of them outside of dodgeball and ive know them for almost  year now my therapist tell me to ask them to hang out sometime and i know it the right thing to do but i cant find the courage to i know they wont judge me but my mind keep telling me that anyways im currently in this program that involves group therapy and one on one therapy and it been an awesome experience it my last week there and then i graduate a they call it im going to miss it very much because it given me a chance to be around people who are also struggling just like me it like family there the therapist are so joyful and happy to be there it almost hard to believe a place like this actually exists it like family there im sad to leave  ive met some cool people there that id like to get to know outside of the program im also sad because ill no longer have people who know what it like to talk to and i know that my weekend will still be lonely im trying to find club and group to join but theyre not very common where i live id have to travel about an hour which i might have to do oh another issue with some of these club is that they rarely have event anyhow im trying to find way to make friend it just a difficult process throw sa in the mix and it even harder i know this is one huge paragraph my apology lol if anyone decides to read this id like to hear your thought and maybe make a friend ,anxiety2588, instance happened where i acted like normal person no awkwardness at all and one instance where i had anxiety but i faced it and got some positive feedback from a woman and starting out today all i could think wa i am so ugly and disgusting one would ever want to look at me i feel weird even speaking about the crap that go on in my head but there you have it,anxiety2589,so im in high school but it a virtualonline school i had to make that change because my anxiety wa so bad that i wa cry every day when i got home im anxious right now since my exam is tomorrow and i have to take it in person i know it stupid because im likely not going to have to talk to anyone but the mere thought of their being other people there make me sick any advice for reducing this feeling,anxiety2590,hi guy ive recently been doing some research on the cause of social anxiety and i found out that supposedly most case of social anxiety are caused by genetics what do you guy think do you think your anxiety wa caused by genetics or environmental factorsview pollhttpswwwredditcompollzehgdh,anxiety2591,i realized that whenever i have a successful conversation with someone or prove to myself that i am social then i feel euphoric and really happy with myself but if i have an awkward conversation or bad social interaction then i feel depressed and awful for example if im with a group of people that i am not close to i feel pressured to talk a much a possible so i wont be judged for being too quiet if i dont talk enough then i feel bad about myself and think why am i so quietwhats wrong with me if i talk enough then im so happy and satisfied it a never ending cycle causing my mood to fluncuate all the time one minute i feel amazing about myself and i feel like i can talk to anyone then the next minute im searching on reddit for advice to fix my social skill ive had this problem for a long a i can remember it the reason why my senior year sucked because i wa just so obsessed with trying to be social and shed the shy and quiet image that everyone ha for me i just want to let go of this obsession so badly,anxiety2592,some people would ask me why dont you participate in event i have my reason but of them being that i am an introvert meaning i dont like being in group of people who would talk to me and it make it difficult for me to interact and leaf me feeling stressed another thing i am not so interested in being in friendship group ive been broken too many time by friend in the past that i am not going to waste my time doing it no offense to anyone but i am not just not going to go through that pain again i prefer to be by myself because it make me feel comfortable another thing and i hate talking about this but i have to say it in school i wa forced to learn social skill now with that said me being an introvert made this much harder on me i wa forced to be in group section and whenever people ask me question like what do you in do in life and have you done anything amazing there are time i wa trying to say thing but it always come out a like well um stuff i guess i wa very awkward and it made me sick to my stomachthen even time when i try to talk everyone just give me a look of we dont care what you have to say and then i am left being ignored which didnt bother me because quite frankly i didnt even want to be in this group anyway thats why it hard for me to have social skill whenever a job asks me how well i do but it something i struggle with all the time mainly because i suffer from anxiety depression and im autisticat the end of the day i just learned to be myself and not let people try to change me for who i am i am introvert and i choose to be around with the right people and not let people decide for me it rare because i only know a few who understands me pretty well but for the vast majority in real life dont seem to get it most of the time,anxiety2593,i started trying to date this girl since about a week or so i inmediately asked for a date and i continued talking to her we spent a week texting  she even send me a selfie of her i wa thinking that everything wa alrightthe night before the date i said to her that i wa exited for the date day  i think it wa weird of my part  she said that if we could meet at pm i said yes  i wa planning a am date  then the day of the date came she went minute late then she wa very dry since the first moment that she saw me lt   i feelt no emotion or anythingwe went to eat pizza she wa all the time using the phone while i wa trying to talk to her this really made me feel very unconfortable  i asked for a selfie with her we took the selfies she only said aw it cute  and nothing more  then she said to go to the park everything that i tried to say it felt like no interest at all from her side then she said that she need to go at pm because she need to do something with a friend  girl  of her  and she didnt even told me about that the night beforei felt even worse so se went to the park and she didnt talked about anything all she said wa that wa me that i needed to talk about something in the park we didnt lasted even  minute there  she didnt wanted to do anything there minute later she had to go i accompained her to the mall to wait for her friend while we were walking i asked her if she ha bf she said that she dont have and she doesnt want that because she is too busy with her study then i questioned that myself why did she even is using an dating app if she doesnt wanted thatthen she asked me if i have tattos if i know how to drive my phone model weirdat the very end i said to her that it would be great to meet other day with more patience  another mistake from me  she  agreed  and that wa it after the date she texted me  thank you for the invitation with an emoji of two hand making a heart   i said  i liked spending it with you   and then i just got ghosted i really feel very bad about myself about this specially me that i have issue with anxiety that some stuff like this make me feel very horrible and left me questioning myself about everything likedid

stuttering  and cant hold a conversation because im too emotionally drained by my overthinking and i feel like im not acting enough of a certain way i worry did my tone sound mean did i speak too loudlyquietly etc this is so draining im going to my first hypnotherapy session this week and hopefully it can help im so tired of my brain never shutting up,anxiety2596,removed,anxiety2597,there is nothing for me here i have gone the past several year with nobody and it unbearablethe only friend i have ever had either were manipulative or ghosted me friend who treated me like i wa inferior mocked me or only did what they did out of pity i could count the amount of friend i had who were like this on one handthe amount of friend i have felt a true connection with is i would have thought that i would be able to deal with loneliness by focusing on my hobby interest or talent and maybe focusing on other aspect of my life but everything feel like a chore i feel myself declining i am losing my shortterm memory i am losing my writing skill reading is more difficult i am losing my passion and i am losing my patience my brain feel hollowi used to be able to compensate for my social anxiety with my creativity by making thing now i am just a consumer who can only sit on the couch and scroll away on my phone and sleepi am seeing people my age doing stuff with their friend they not only have social life but are intelligent and have lot of potential they are people who somehow handle with life the way they dothere is just so much pressure it take so much effort to even attempt to get on the same level a my peer who even then arent even that remarkable in the greater scope of thing they are average but in my perception the thing that they do seem impossiblewhenever i vent or talk about myself i can always hear that redditors voice at the back of my head telling me to stop acting like the victim stop sitting on your as waiting for some change to happen you arent trying i have been trying i have been trying to fake some confidence in hope of gradually developing real confidence i have been trying to seek help i met with at least  therapist i learned that many ask question after question and annoyingly tilt their head and ask and how do you feel about thati once participated in group therapy where i said that i had problem with making friend and that i get so intimidated by people the girl in the group proceeded to say some shit like yeah i agree i hate people too even though they talked about their friend and social life in past group session i dont wanna seem like the kind of person that arrogantly say youll never understand but i genuinely think that they dont understand having nobody to confide with for year i have been on  medication and none of them workedif i were lonely i wish i would at the very least compensate for it to some degree with a positive characteristic with for example intelligence wit creativity talent attractiveness yes i know it shallow of me to say attractiveness a look arent everything and whatever i dont wanna start an argument i have no positive characteristicsi am on the verge of giving up no matter how much effort i spend the result is the same a doing absolutely nothingi am not suicidal under no circumstance would i ever seriously plan on ending it all because i do not believe in absolute i dont truly believe that there is  hope for me if that were the case i would probably have plan i just dont want to deal with whatever im dealing withi have high expectation for myself yet i have no ability to meet them ill inevitably be disappointed i am trying so hard i am mentally burnt out from everything life in general,anxiety2598,anyone else have like this mini battle with themselves whenever it time to remove your mask and eat in front of people it so stressful especially if youve brought your own meal,anxiety2599,i begin college next year in january and im already so anxious about going my brain is overthinking everything and i think the absolute worst is going to happen i feel like it going to be a repeat of my high school year and ill be labeled a the weird girl who never speaks to

trying to work up the courage to reply to my damn text all day i have not looked at my phone in more than a weekwhen i see that i receive a message ill think something like ill reply after i finished my coffee which turn into well in an hour is probably still fine and then to ok it late already i wont reply today but tomorrow right after getting up ill definitely do it which i of course never end up doing after day have passed i feel terrible for ghosting people for so long and my anxiety begin to spiral upward even more ill think stuff like my friend and family must hate me at this point for not replying my bos will probably fire me so it becomes even harder to look at my message of the time the text i end up receiving are never a bad a i made them out to be however i literally cannot escape this vicious circle of procrastination and guilt and i have a constant level of anxiety instead of simply taking the  minute to read and answer my message at least once a day doe anyone have or ha anyone had similar problem with textbased communication and perhaps found a strategy to overcome them i literally tried everything from setting myself deadline to bargaining with myself and reward i cant seem to bring myself to reply on time,anxiety2610,removed,anxiety2611,removed,anxiety2612,i had severe conversation social anxiety and got made fun by people that i cant talk to anyone when i wa a young i didnt have any female friend simple friendly conversation wa terrifying with men or womenwhat changed everything is exposure i used to be the biggest critic and hater of exposure and always bashed it in forum or group i always made the excuse im already doing exposure since i had to go to school and wa outside alot already what difference would more exposure donot until i actually tried it very deep it put a light bulb in my head and had a big realization that i actually wasnt doing it deep enough and long enough i started small by doing thing like saying hi to people and small talk with cashier majority of people are nice and talk back you can tell people that dont want to speak by them having a reserved face expression i then made  a commitment to go outside for  hour per day to start small amp short convos with stranger then build my way to longer convos i went to place that were easy to start convos with stranger that wa social acceptable and wouldnt look weird place such a park bus stop bench bar party train station restaurant etcyou have to start small then build your way up it take time doesnt work right away you should see small result within  week of consistent practice within  month your conversation anxiety will be almost gone i can now approach anyone and hold conversation very easy with strangersthe reason why youre social anxiety isnt at the worst spectrum is because youve been doing a limited exposure your whole life by by needing to go to work school amp hangout with family these forced limited exposure is whats keeping your social anxiety from going crazy if you expand these area of limited exposure you will see more social freedom in your lifethe reason why exposure work is because your subconscious mind the subconscious is a machine that doesnt operate in logic it ha more power than you atleast most case it responsible for making you scared of people when naturally you arent when you do the opposite and force yourself in scary social situation you train it believe social situation are not freighting since you are putting yourself in them desensitization is the name of this process by the subconscious mind desensitization happen in positive in negative way like if something taste incredibly delicious by the th time you eat it will will become boring the same with exposing yourself to scary social situation by the ndth time it becomes le scary,anxiety2613,i wa actually feeling good i dont know what happened my church wa going to do this thing where all the people in my young adult sunday

culture but we do have a few thing in common the best we could do to cope with our sa issue is to help each other out i know what it like to wake up each morning dealing with this so hey if you want a buddy to talk to could literally be anything feel free to message me we could probably feel a little better helping each other out knowing we have that one friend we could talk to and who would understand have a good day ,anxiety2617,me and my classmate decided to meet and i dont have any friend to any of them i dont talk to them or i dont start conversation because im not good at it but i

there something wrong in me and feel more bad about myselffor what ever reason i dont want people to pity me i prefer them to talk to me just a normal person but i know that if im feeling out of place my anxiety attacking me and it showing on my facehow to overcome it i want to stop my anxiety in around of stranger and act normal without my eye feeling weird and itchyps i dont have a good grammar i live in rd world country and these kind of topic doesnt really talk about,anxiety2618,it so bad i cant move or react to anything i feel like a fucking bot in public,anxiety2619,ive changed my mindset but idk something ha to be wrong with my brain i cannot look up when im fucking sitting in a parked car in the schoolor at people i trust face for that longi just need to gain my confidence back fully,anxiety2620,im not diagnosed with anxiety but im very certain i have it because of how much i worry lately ive been having some weird heart issue where that area just ha this weird general discomfort and tugging feeling sometimes it not that bad and other time it very prominent and it bother me i went to the doctor and they did an ekg just to make sure nothing is wrong they said the ekg seemed normal and screened me for anxiety which they think is the main cause of the pain  they prescribed me some antiinflammatory pill to take for about a week but nothing helped i dont know why it all of a sudden came on a im not more stressed than i usually am or anything i gave up caffeine soda ive tried to eat better and ive been going to the gym but nothing help ha anyone else had this issue and what did they do to help it,anxiety2621,i always feel it in my gut when im around people and even randomly when im alone how can i stop this,anxiety2622,like on a first day of school i would try to act confident and likeable but a soon a i embarrass myself i will shut down and take on the role of a quiet class weirdo because it just too late to act and seem like a normal person again because everyone already saw my true awkward self i become so detached from the rest of the class id just sit there emotionless with my phone stuck to my face without interacting to anybody because everyone already think that im retarded  this keep happening to me my voice will get all weird and im like a legit different person in school i give up my boundary and who i really want to be,anxiety2623,coworkers are like the bane of my existence when i first started in customer service i wa really afraid of interacting with customer and i thought that would be my biggest problem it not amp i actually dont do that bad with them funny how that work but my coworkers are a different story like i worked at a grocery store for a year and never ever felt comfortable around them when i first started we made some small talk to get to know each other but i didnt have much to offer in term of conversation after that id literally just stand silent at the register with my arm crossed while they all hung out and talked the worst would be when it wa just me and one other person amp i would pray for customer to come so there wa no reason to talk they even had a group chat that i wasnt invited to i could just sense how they felt abt me through their body language i wa just miserable now at my new job a a registrar im still struggling with this i think ive tried to be a little more outgoing but it really tough and often doesnt go well it justhard bc everyone already know each other by the time you get there so how do you fit in although there a couple of other people who started at the same time a me yet they are fitting in nicely so i also cant stop comparing myself to them it just suck to be sitting there with someone in awkward uncomfortable silence i feel so out of my depth trying to interact with people like a normal human being im still trying to give myself grace though i might not be the most talkative and i might be awkward  but im not an asshole at least i hope i dont come across that way  im polite i come to work on time and even though im new ive been doing everything correctly amp helping others out and to be fair ive noticed that my coworkers tend to gossip about someone but then will turn around and smile in said person face so maybe it good that i keep my distance from them i try to reassure myself that if they are talking

memory of peoplei just started a new job and it very social client outing happy hour etc i have never historically been a social person but i feel like ive grown more social over the year this is mainly due to the fact that i havent had to keep active relationship with these people and for some reason that really put me at ease about interacting with others unfortunately due to my job i have to form relationship with people and i cant stop obsessing over every detail it driving me fucking crazy ive gotten so much good feedback and signal that im doing extremely well at my job but every single night after i finish my job i am literally so anxious and depressed over myself that it is unbearable it affecting my life  most particularly my sense of self focus and mental energy these thought i have theyre so intrusive i have these unwanted thought about making a fool of myself or that i somehow am offensive and unlikeable in the moment i enjoy the socialization but the after thought hit me like a ton of brick i cant stand the thought of anyone judging me or knowing me i feel weak and overly so unhappy in a sense i feel lost because i truly have never known what to do with people i dont know how im going to cope,anxiety2640,near the beginning of the year i have got severe chronic brain fog and it worsens every time i go to sleep and each time i wake up it get alot

affirmation change the way i view thing and medication ive tried everything but still i just feel so off when im talking people it like my brain just shuts down or i start feeling really cold and start going into a panic attackmy last resort wa medication i wa diagnosed with gad and i possibly have ocd but undiagnosed ssri made me feel numb atleast i wasnt depressed that i wa anxious all the time but it wa still there blocking me from living life to the fullesti tried xanax once or twice from a friend and it wa the first time in my life i experienced having no anxiety i wanted to cry because i had never experienced that before of course xanax is very dangerous people get addicted to it so it not really a fixi get like  hour of sleep or i sleep all day now and stay wide awake most of the night wondering how im going to live my life like this every time i go out now i have a severe panic attack when i get home where i feel like im having a heart attackits slowly gotten worse over the year when i wa in high school it wa manageable enough that i could talk to certain people i wa comfortable with without feeling awfulthe panic attack are becoming more severe and frequent now i feel like my life is ending when it should be just getting started im  year old about to be  living with my parent no car i sold it because i cant handle driving and not going to college i wouldnt be able to do it,anxiety2645,so this is mainly me just looking for an outlet to say a couple thing but id also love it if you guy had some input or if there anything that have helped yallever since i wa a child ive always felt like an outcast in social group and friend i came from an extremely loving home where i wa always supported but when it came to friend i always felt like i didnt matter over the year ive been through several tumultuous friendship specifically one where i wa bullied every time i wa around a friend group and told it wa my fault because i wa too sensitive and friend that have acted like and told me that i am needy and desperate i also look back on the fact that other guy always avoided me and i never felt like i wa able to talk to other guy and always ended up hanging out with girl now although i have been able to come out of some relationship that were harmful i still feel this way quite a lot i have friend dont get me wrong and many of them are now guy but i cant help but feel that i am not important i always always feel unimportant to other people like if i dropped them a friend they wouldnt even notice even though im friend with other guy now i never feel that im able to actually be one of the guy when i go to social gathering like tonight i always feel like im not really part of the group or like people want to talk to me i always feel like im a chore to be around im always going out of my way to make people feel good about themselves welcome and loved but i never seem to receive the same from others i cant remember a time in my life where ive felt love returned equally from a friend it honestly destroying me every time i see other people it all i can think about and i worry ill never get it ha anyone else gone through this what helped do i just have a bad view on friendship or is this past hurt coming up in current relationship or could it be something with me,anxiety2646,so i met up with my lab research group for our final presentation of our experiment in a study room i walk in and two of them are already there i say waddup nerd and they seemed like they were just talking about me like they had that look in their face so i take a seat closest to the door because im always afraid that no one really want me to sit next to them the last person showed up and took a seat next to me after  minute he asks our groupmate sitting to his left if the seat next to him ha a ghost in it or is it open so he get up and move to the empty seat in the corner where it wa a lot more crowded and i can feel the other guy staring at me like they were expecting me to react i felt embarrassed and i felt my face getting numb i wanted to vomitlike did i make him feel uncomfortable did i ever say or did something wrongi might have did i made sure i gave him enough spaceanyways i wanted to express my feeling i cant eat because of what i experienced today,anxiety2647,m here been fine with eye contact my entire life but a couple month ago i started getting bullied which lowered my self esteem tremendously i started overthinking basic thing like walking the way i talk eye contact feeling constantly scrutinized and judged ive always been an anxious person but it never been to this extent it started a occasionally thinking about eye contact making me lose focus but it evolved into consciously thinking about it every single time every time i start talking to someone my brain immediately go dont fuck this up act normal and i just completely lose track of the conversation basically go on autopilot i get so pissed at myself after start feeling nervous feel like they could see i didnt know what the fuck i wa doing now i cant even talk to my family without thinking about it i feel like any second theyre just going to question why im acting so weird or stop liking me a a person i cant do this shit anymore i just want to stop thinking about it so it can come naturally but it a conscious effort now any advice would be greatly appreciated this is ruining my life,anxiety2648, here,anxiety2649,plain and simple how what are you social rule of meeting new peopleon the job doe and dontwhat do you talk aboutor is it smart to be talkative with your bos,anxiety2650,any advice is very appreciated,anxiety2651,my social anxiety now is very lowlevel ive been aggressively attacking it with exposure for a while now but at it worst i couldnt even go grocery shoppingwhat if i went to pay and my card got declined id be so embarrassed everyone in line behind me would think i wa some poor idiot and be pissed for me wasting their time and the cashier would be upset too cause theyd have to reshelve all the stuff id for sure blush and break into a sweat theyd all stare id have to walk out while they watched mefuck no i dont need thatthat wa a long time ago and i go grocery shopping all the time now  i like to go more often fresher food carry le more exposure but the thing happened todayi brought the wrong card with me today and got declined at the till still a little bit embarrassing  i dont like wasting people time and still care too much what other people think  but it wa no big thing the lady wa super chill about it all tried to imply that it wa their machine and not me it wa me nobody died nobody complained so i reckon if i can make it through my worstcase scenario without incident then there isnt much else that is too much to facekeep fighting the good fight folk im here to tell you that it absolutely can and will get better if you put the time and effort in unfortunately it wont go away on it owngood luck everybody,anxiety2652,i have been stuck on step  start a conversation for so long now i dont think ill ever be able to get past it,anxiety2653,there are so many people here and iam hiding in my room shaking and they are all talking so loud i feel like i cant breath what am i supposed to doits so anxious,anxiety2654,now this is where my severe anxiety come into play my neighbor directly behind me either dont use curtain or have clear one  window face my house they are above me on a hill  story so my fence doe nothing they are usually standing in a clear view at the kitchen window anytime i use my yard ican see them clearly they are always watching out their window iv planted tree but will be awhile before they are tall enough anyone else have this problem,anxiety2655,hi im starting university early next year in high school i barely made any friend and wa left out of nearly everything my social skill are also shit i still remember leaving an impression on other people that i wa somewhat autistic because i speak in chunk disconnected from oneanother i really want to make a change but im not sure how to introduce myself in uni or even how to make friend or what to and not participate in would definitely like some advice if thats something i can ask for thanksps i heard people mainly talk about interest and i guess mine would be fps and gacha game im a loner so my whole life ha been playing game at home like a secluded hermit,anxiety2656,it mainly communicating that im most afraid of i cant seem to find a job that doesnt require much interaction or no interaction at all i did try doordash but pay is shit and i do have to talk with restaurant owner for pickup  im just needing suggestion on job a person with sad might be able to handle thanksps i just finished high school and i dont mind working at night in fact i can probably work anytime within a day h period my sleep schedule is beyond fucked after exam and changing it wouldnt make any significant difference in my health,anxiety2657,i had a conversation with someone for the first time in a club ive been going to an afterschool club since mid october ive never had a conversation with anyone apat from a mumble a yes or a no today a guy whom also speaks spanish my native language came up to me and said hello i replied and i forced myself to continuing talking when the guy stopped talking it ended up being a one sided conversation a the one i have a lot but now i wa the one doing the talking i am so fucking extatic i made it after fucking infinity time i had a conversation it feel like a dream come true ive been hyping myself up to talk to people for month now and finally i did it i know this isnt the end and i have to continue pushing myself to socialize more but right now i needed to tell anyone about it,anxiety2658,background i stopped going to a physical highschool in the beginning of my freshman year because it made me extremely depressed i wa such an outcast and few people liked me i just couldnt take it anymore im online now and while im very glad i dont have to deal with people i am extremely lonely it hurt so much i dont go out of the house at all i havent talked to someone who wasnt related to me and wa near my age in like a couple of month i dont like making online friend so im at a dead end at this point im  and have absolutely zero friend or even acquaintance everyone i talk to on a monthly basis is my familymy town suck and there not much for people like me to do to meet friend there plenty of people my age here but they all are awful amp hateful and it the main reason i stopped going to highschool plus i feel like i cant maintain a meaningful friendship with other teen if im not going to highscool alongside them too even the people who are like me i cant form a relationship with because ive been so isolated for so long i just come off a weird and oddi dont know what to do i feel like im missing out on doing thing i should be doing for my age the only good thing out of it is all the time i have to teach myself thing but it doesnt make up for having friend there no club for me to do i feel like if i dont find any social interaction soon i might relapse into depression and harmful thought my last resort is trying to find friend through instagram but i feel like that wouldnt work because people dont know who i am to begin with  idk what to do,anxiety2659,removed,anxiety2660,this is kind of a rant general post im wondering if people can relate to im probably going to overexplain and ramble so thank you to those who read until the endive f known this family friend m for a while now and for the last few year had a slight suspicion he had a crush on me it wa exciting meeting him at party because i found him cute too but didnt think much of him until the next time we would meet usually twice a yeartwo month ago he came over to my house i hadnt seen him in over a year because i wa abroad for most of the year and i had forgotten about my suspicion of him having a crush on me but after interacting with him for those few hour my suspicion were back he also asked for my number so we could discus applying for scholarship and club a he had been admitted to the same university a me this year  we met up a few time on campus since then and it became pretty clear that i wa probably right in my suspicion the way he talked to me the sort of question he would ask the general body language all made it fairly obvious he even joined one of the club i wa in and only showed up when i would the more we hung out though the more i think ive begun liking him back and because of this ive become paranoid of going out in public in the fear ill run into him i become nauseous every time my brother brings him up or i think i see him walking around on campus i started sweating just walking by his bus stop today even though it wa his class time so there wa little to no chance of him showing up ive also become paranoid that he stalked some of my social there nothing particularly wrong with this but he added me through contact search on snapchat and it almost confirmed it for me that he wa looking for my social ive noticed ive been viewed by a private account a few time on linkedin and tiktok too never happened to me before the few time ive run into him by coincidence in public he pretend he doesnt see me if i shout a greeting at him he run over to me happily and asks to join me in whatever im doing even if it just reading in the library for hour i just dont know what to do i cant be around him anymore or i feel physically sick i enjoyed my time with him but the fact he never reach out to me directly is causing me to second guess myself so much that i feel like vomiting just thinking about the whole stupid situation i also hate that it affecting the literal route i take to class now ive begun avoiding path i know he will probably take ive deleted snapchat because i dont want to see his snap location every time i think about him which ive tried to stop doing i get knot in my stomachsweat profusely dae have this sort of reaction to a crushknowing they are being crushed on i hate how bad it getting i want to be able to walk through campus not in fear,anxiety2661,okay so i have a crippling fear of public speaking and tomorrow i have to do a group presentation i am actually so scared of public speaking that i dropped a class this semester due to having to do a solo presentation even though i would love to just bail on the presentation my anxiety would be so much worse because i would feel bad about being a shitty team member so ive already told myself that im going to do the presentation i am currently trying to get on some type of antidepressantanxiety med for my social anxiety but im freaking out about tomorrow im thinking about maybe drinking a beer before i go to school because it would make me a little le anxious and tense however im worried that people will smell alcohol on my breath and it will leave a bad impression what do you guy think,anxiety2662,i now fucking hate rock brain glass man worry wall and body snatcher my social anxiety wasnt that noticeable at the time even to me but now that it is in full swing i couldnt hate this more,anxiety2663,im f ive never really had a big group of friend in my life i cant really say ive never had friend because i did at every stage in my life i did have people i would talk too in this current moment i have about  friend who i casually talk too and we keep tab on one another even though we make plan to hang out it doesnt really go anywhere ive been introverted since highschool and i always preferred to be by myself i didnt realize this until i would hang out with my friend during college and right after i get home i wa so mentally exhausted      now my sil who is about  year older than me ha really been saying some mean thing to me like i have no friend or insinuating that im lam because i dont leave my house now i can explain this growing up i lived with my mom and her boyfriend and her bf molested me for several year on and off i didnt really understand what wa happening to me until i wa in highschool i absolutely hating being home and id find place to go by myself just so i could come home late at night when i wa almost done with highschool my mom and her bf separated so we moved to a family member house far  away during covid unfortunately we couldnt afford our rent so my mom brought her bf back to live with u and he tried a few time to touch me inappropriately again i thought it wa my fault because i never told her that he molested me well eventually two year ago i did tell her and she didnt believe me and accused me of lying shes still with the guy today however he moved out a im in the healing phase i love being home and finally feeling comfortable i can finally sleep in peace and wear what i want without the thought of what if he rape me one day i dont feel like i need to explain this my sil at all that this is why im home i dont have a amazing social life and i dont have a big group of friend i dont go out drinking every weekend and i dont go to party or do drug  according to my sil and her family im super lame and wasting my life away im christian so never once in my life ha drug and alcohol really interested me  but ive had my sil cousin call me a prude because i didnt want to smoke weed im getting really tired to the judge mental opinion of everyone why do i need  friend and a social life to prove im worth something im healing and learning to love myself again some day i wont lie i wish i had place to go and friend to meet but then other day to even get out of bed is a difficult task

we have a lot of drama going down at our job and a lot of people want intel on whats going to happen with the company when we change ownership next year i see people sitting down having conversation and no one ever come up to me including people in my own department it disheartening am i think unlikable that people dont want to tell me important information about my job reminds me of when my bos sent an email to my entire department except me notifying u the building wa closed for the next day and i showed up to work having no idea we were closedi used to be delusional enough to think people liked me and they thought i wa just quiet or reserved but now i just think people dont care for my existence at all which is fair because it come across like i dont care for them either but i do oh well maybe at my next job i can start over and play a different character at work besides the mysterious quiet person that no one interacts with,anxiety2667,i am a woman in her mid s and i suffer

genitalia that i tend to hide it a lot i am not into casual sex all i want is a serious and meaningful relationship with a man who want the same at this point if there are no good chance i totally understand it although if there are suggestion that can help feel free to share them,anxiety2668, hii  wa at a phone store and this girl store clerk wa answering my  question and  giving  me advice

clerkthanks,anxiety2669,hello person reading i am writing this post because the truth is i have been suffering with a problem for about a long a i can remember i need help my name is leon im  year old and ive been suffering with social anxiety for year the last several being most challenging though this isnt something that ha always burdened me despite having always been a more introverted quiet guyperhaps more sensitive evenas a younger child i didnt have any issue socially say at school nor throughout high school in term of making friend etc this isnt to say no sign of social anxiety were present but you get the point it wasnt debilitating enough back then to pay too much notice to it fast forward to the age of  i fell into a deep depression due to various insecurity and self confidence issue this continued in length until around the age of  i tried cbt which didnt help a i wa too compromised to engage with the work properly at the time instead i tried a normal therapistcounsellor which helped me tremendously i did that for  year age present currently ill have a session with my therapist once per month if i feel the need to touch base and get some thing off my chestwith all this being said there is a specific component to my social anxiety which produce most of my sadness and pain at least in my mind i couldnt say for how long exactly but for about a long a i can remember particularly in social situation i experience an involuntary twitching of the face it can occur when talking to almost anybody in any given situation it seems to be more prevalent when meeting new people having everyones undivided attention talking to people im not overly familiar with occasion with lot of people etc sometimes it happens when im speaking to people a close a my family and friend whom ive known for year id say it mainly revolves around the eye mouth and cheek at it worst even my neck can twitch i feel it at it worst when i have repressed emotion that im not expressing authentically for instance if someone crack a joke that i dont find awfully funny ill do a fake smilelaugh which brings about the facial twitching sometimes i have a bit of control over it other time not so much ive also noticed my physiology and how im feeling within my body affect this greatly if im already feeling tenseanxious the twitching is exacerbated if im calm in my body and im not in a fight or flight state it le likely to occur now this isnt something that ha been pointed out by anybody ive interacted with in fact not even once sometimes i suspect people can see it just by looking at their expression when talking to me but maybe im projecting my therapist when bringing it up stated quite honestly that she couldnt see what i wa talking about shed never seen my face twitch during our session now im entirely accepting of the fact that it may not be awfully obvious to anyone that i interact with howeverthis doe not change the fact that this ha unfortunately ruined my life in many way it make day to day socialising more stressful than it need to be it made getting job painfully difficult even simple thing like going to get a haircut or walking into town this is something ive cried over multiple time it also lead me to fear for my future in term of datingfinding a partner etc the list go on to put it simply it fucking exhausting and im so so tired of it all i want answer and i want help it probably worth mentioning that i am on mg of sertraline a prescribed by my doctor for the depression and anxiety ive experienced i would say it helped but not so much in term of the facial twitching im not entirely sure if my symptom are a a result of a psychological or physiological occurrence perhaps it both is it genetic i really couldnt say what i can say is that ive felt incredibly alone and ashamed of this issue it embarrassing i feel im not able to fully express myself in social situation when i know im perfectly capable of articulating what i want how i want but this facial twitching stop me from doing so i feel like im imprisoned in my own body i want to come across competently i want to display a charisma some confidence part of me wonder wether or not all of this is a result of social anxiety or if the facial twitching alone is causing the social anxiety anyways if there anybody who read this post and can relate or maybe even know what this problemcondition might be id be so grateful for your inputhelp thank you,anxiety2670,i spent a whole  year suffering in silence barely left the house couldnt make

people say hello to me or make casual comment to me a i walk passed them it is sad that at  year old and having watched people have common greeting and idle small talk with each other while feeling left out and awkward i never got that it wa partially up to me to do the same thing i thought others werent doing i just assumed they saw me a awkward and off putting and therefore never talked to me

people and i have a long history of bad social experience when my social anxiety really kick in i can get intestinal pain and cramp and there even been instance where ive passed out in the middle of a presentation or a job interview i dont use social medium and though i sometimes see longtime friend who essentially feel like family i spend most of my time working on my computer watching tv or playing a video game ive never been in a romantic relationship which is something i want i have very low self esteem and i consistently criticize myself for almost every little thing i doi really want to make new friend find a romantic partner and build some confidence so im trying to put some effort in doing thing that challenge my anxiety i want to possibly go to a bar club group meeting charity event or something similar but finding motivation ha been very difficult i can be pessimistic and use example from the past a reason for why socializing now will only result in more pain so im hoping to find others struggling with social anxiety who might have good advice for me i would love to chat and discus tip or trick on battling social anxiety or maybe make a friend so we can check in on each other from time to time anything would be nice honestly a ive gotten used to being sad and lonely all the time and i want to to step out of my comfort zone and make some personal life change

people that i kinda know and it put me way out of my comfort zone but i did it and i enjoy it and im finally comfortably out the house on a very consistent basis this is all well and good but the initial buzz from this exposure ha gone and now i find myself back in some sort of rut worrying and doubting myself on wether i can function in what seem to me a being intense social environment  where do i go next what do people find useful exposure activity  i want to once again do something im scared of to get that feeling back again,anxiety2680,need help please somebody im so seriousthis shit hard to overcome bro,anxiety2681,i have a giant forehead and my jaw is sunken in which i believe is because i stopped wearing my retainer when i wa  ive never had a girlfriend or met someone who like me i dont think any woman could be physically attracted to me im on autism spectrum and have severe anxiety and depression so obviously my brain is messed up and i believe my appearance is indicative of genetic misfitedness people have told me i look normal and it all in my head so i try to go with that but ive also heard people making joke about how i look for my entire adult life ive posted on ramiugly and people confirmed i very much amits all i ever think about and im always looking in the mirror whenever i talk to people i can imagine them thinking about how weird i must be how do i deal with this id do anything just to be normalwhat i look like httpsimgurcomazobs,anxiety2682,and i feel like i fumbled and now somehow my brain is convincing me that everyone hate me for it whats crazy is that this presentation is just one component of a group project for the course and for literally every other written component of the project ive been doing all the work because my group member just dont contribute and leave thing to the last minute this entire time ive been carrying the whole group but now with the presentation being my weakest area i feel like i messed up a little and now everyone must think im the one who the least prepared in the group when it the opposite i didnt want to disappoint the prof because they dont know that behind the scene ive been the most hardworking and now i feel like all they see and think of me is based on this presentationi even know im overreacting because someone from another group messed up even more than i did and no one so much a batted an eyelash but my brain keep telling me stupid stuff to convince me otherwise it spoiling the rest of my day which is annoying co i have a test later and i dont want this to be constantly on my mind the entire time i suppose im not really asking for help but just venting and seeking reassurance,anxiety2684,when i get an unexpected compliment usually on my outfit especially from a stranger on the street i get inexplicably anxious the unexpected focus of attention on myself make me feel this way perhaps im just bad at receiving compliment the irony is that when i dress myself i dress to get compliment or so that i fit in with fashion trend,anxiety2685,i cant say no it unhealthy and detrimental to myself but more often than not i absolutely have to avoid conflict because for some reason the worst case scenario in any given situation is the person or person asking something of me raising their voice andor coming away from our interaction with a bad impression

intended any advice,anxiety2691, ha been my best or worst year so far depending on how i choose to see it this year i tried to push myself out of my comfort zone by doing thing that really triggered my anxiety for example i started driving alone volunteering to do practice when the professor asked who wanted to do something talking to classmate i usually dont talk with went to the bank for the first time went running a few time exercising in front of other ppl make me anxious a hell and even went on some date with a guy i liked because i did all these thing i put myself in situation where i could have embarrassed myself and guess what in most of them i did my sa obviously make me look very awkward when talking to others sometimes my brain freeze and i cant think logically and end up looking dumb sometimes my body language and facial expression make me look weird this year wa definitely the one with the most embarrassing moment for meevery time something embarrassing happened to me i felt humiliated and cried for day my brain wa like were never doing that again i just wanted to hide forever however i realized that i wasnt giving myself enough credit for going out of my comfort zone i started viewing those embarrassing moment a little win because each moment meant that i did something that ha been scary to do for year i kept doing it and pushing myself i still have a long way to go with sa but this little mindset change ha helped me a lot i feel a little le selfconscious and im not so scared of embarrassing myself while doing insignificant thing like driving running errand talking with classmate im now trying to build up the courage to start a new job this month which is the scariest thing ever for me because ill be stuck in a place with a lot of people ive never seen before i decided to share this because im very proud of myself and maybe it can help someone else too embarrassment only happens because you are putting yourself out there which mean you are making progress ,anxiety2692,i grew very far apart from people i once called friend i started to find them immature and that we had absolutely nothing in common i smoked a ton of weed

making me anxious especially doing it on a video call i feel awkward i hate camera so much because it distorts how i actually look and make me look uglier so im afraid to show myself similar in real life im still afraid to show my face to other people i had therapy a year ago for a different reason so i dont know what to expect this time i know i need therapy but im really dreading it because it cost money and im a money preserver i dont want to feel like a financial burden to my parent not sure if i should wait till after im done with college to pay for therapy because i dont want my parent to pay all this money for me,anxiety2702,this is my first post on reddit and hopefully im doing it right so pls bare wif me here so i have difficulty in socialising with people i wouldnt necessarily say i have social anxiety since i never got it checked but im just so sick and tired of my parent lecturing me almost everyday about me not wanting to talk or ask anyone anything outside whenever i go outside i just feel so stress i start to sweat alot my breathes start to go abit unstable and i just want to get out of there a soon a possible the last thing i want to do is to talk to someone or ask someone about something i would usual just circle around before deciding to give in and ask someone or make up an excuse to my parent but they know that i dont want to talk to other people but instead of approaching me in a more pacifist way they would always just scold and mock me about it saying that i have a mouth but i dont even know how to use it or saying how me having a mouth is useless i did talk to them about it saying how i really dont feel comfortable with communicating with others and asking them to not push me so much or at least not give me any hurtful comment but they never listen they still say the same thing over and over like how im disconnected from reality i dont think ill ever approach them again about this topic again since they clearly didnt take it seriously but i just wanted to rant abit on it anyway thank you for reading this rantside note dont get me wrong btw they are pretty good parent they are just rlly harsh with their word,anxiety2703, hi everyone

living at somewhere else so i see them rarely i do everything going outside eating shopping etc alonehowever my relationship with one girl  at the office is special and i know her for  year  but our talk are limited to work hour only we rarely talked after work so i never assumed anything other than friendship however while drunk she kissed me and said she want a relationship i said think about it when you are sober and we should talk about this later because i could not believed someone would ever think such a thing with me after being sober she apologised and said a relationship can happen naturally if it ever will we talked afterwards and she said she consider me a her friend she ha career goal and not looking for a relationship  after these event she stayed away from me avoid talking to me and i wa really sad that i have no one else at the office to talk to a a friend so i felt lonely last week she wa back to normal she came to me and started talking and it wa a slow day last friday so we talked for two hour straight i wa really happybut now i feel extremely depressed and cried all over the weekend because i really want this girl to be part of my life that we talk not only at the office but all the time that we spend time together outide work i have two best friend from my childhood that i know more than  year and i really get along with this girl like she is a friend from my childhood though i only know her from work for  year never ever before i get along with someone this well i truly feel like she is my soulmate and a person that i can meet one in a lifetimei dont know if she felt heartbroken because i kind of rejected her when we were drunk and she stayed away or she really changed her mind about relationship obviously the former even make me feel sadderbut what make me feel saddest is that this is or could be a one sided thing that i am feeling she talk with me for two hour she laugh a lot talk me about her secret gossiping etc and she really doe not feel anything are all the talk from  year is for really nothing doe the drunk talk really not mean anythingi have no idea what to do next but i feel so sad that i am feeling amazing about this

in the facebook invite page and my friend had never told me it wa something she wanted to wait to announce so i had no idea is this a normal social thing that people know not to do i feel like everyone that liked my post her friend and family are thinking im an as for posting the name before her my friend swears up and down it okay and she isnt mad but i still dont believe her i feel incredibly awful and cant let it go or stop being hard on myself for doing that im just wondering if it something i should have known a a social norm or am i being too hard on myself,anxiety2720,holy shit this is just gonna be me venting because ive just realised something huge my anxiety with men specifically all come back to my dad i realised this to some degree a while ago im  but ive only just come to term with the extent of it just now after reading a reply to a youtube comment i left on a video about selfhatred and anxiety i commented on the video focus on how childhood trauma cause these thing saying how i couldnt see the connection because i never experienced these thing someone replied and said that your perspective on what you went through in your childhood can be very different from how someone coming from an outside perspective would see it i sat and thought about this for a bit i thought well i know im generally uncomfortable and anxious around men more so than woman because i havent been able to maintain a close relationship with any men in my life into adulthood and if you dont feel like you can be yourself around men in your family how can you expect to be able to open up to any man but it more than that my dad wa and is more emotionally absent than i realised i dont remember the last time i felt like he really listened to me or engaged me in conversation in a way that made me feel like he valued what i had to say he always make me feel like he know better than me and that my perspective isnt worth hearing he even talk over me sometimes it not pursposeful and he not intentionally cruel it just the way he is i know he love me but it doesnt feel like he like me this last point applies to my brother a well we dont really share anything in common anymore and we barely talk despite still living together the only other male in my family wa my grandfather while he wa still alive and he wa a complete narcissicist that showed little interest in my brother or i when i take a step back and look at my relationship with the men in my family more objectively like this i really can see the connection to my anxiety im desperate for male affection and yet im terrified of pursuing it because i feel like ill be rejected like i feel rejected by my male family member it more than that even i feel unworthy of love like a man could never love me or like me really and it all stem back to this even before this realisation though ive been working on this trying to open myself up to love to accept that im enough a i am i think knowing this now will help with thati dont expect anyone to read this all the way through but if you did thankyou i really just needed to write this all out to help myself process all

their inlaws and reached out to me that they wanna meet up i would love to and of course very anxious about it too i fell sick the whole week it how it always been headache feverish back pain indigestion yknow the drill lolanyway we finally planned a meetup for the first time but it didnt happen the plan wa to meet at an event but the ticket sold out i secured mine earlier so they told me theyll be at a nearby area on the same day so we could still meet there wa a couple of texting i mean i dread phone call right with delayed reply which wa kinda ok to me though i kept checking my phone every min because i just thought that they were probably busy having fun resting whatever this is happening in a city that im not used to but ive been to the same event last year at the same venue my mom and brother were around so i wa kinda confident about going alone this time not that i have friend though xxafter im done at the event i went to a gallery nearby to see an exhibition also because it wa calmer and i needed the escape but i wa still restless after a couple of hour i got a reply theyre still around at a certain location but i wa quite reluctant and anxious to walk to theirs i wa going to ask if we could meet at a middle point somewhere and even contemplated giving them a call to make it easier but i just couldnt  i started to feel exhausted and in the end i told them that i had to go home because i wasnt feeling good which wa true my back pain and the headache got worse but i kept thinking how terrible that wa that it sounded like an excuse and howd they feel about it though the reply wa it okay and they wish i feel better soon this happened yesterday the ride back home wa hellish i had to get off the train at one point so i could get some air munch on something and lie down i guess the anxiety over meeting new people and that it a fail anxiety from the event the crowd wa insane xx the restlessness the fact i forgot to eat the whole time e etc totally zapped out my energy body and mind and today i cant stop thinking how terrible yesterday wa how terrible of a person i wa maybe i shouldve just made the call and told them i still want to meet up but perhaps a quick one maybe i shouldve just taken a break relax wash my face eat something and whatever before making the decision how i should communicate thing clearly i wish i could make up for this anxious and scared  at the same time idk how do i do this how doe one make friend can someone who socially anxious awkward and struggle with attachment issue do this what should we talk about

others life and hopefully may have some advice on whatever ail you if not then at least i helped you vent it out  first time trying this so bear with me if i dont respond timely and below are some condition for me to filter out who i can help  and over please  i am just someone with life experience so anyone younger please understand that you should talk to the proper parentsadults honestly i would prefer people even above  because ngl probably a lot of my advice is gonna come down to you need to experience more straight up  willing to audiovideo chat if required this is more because sharing life story take a lot of time and sometimes pure text conversation can lead to miscommunication must be willing to understand this is not a quick fix and i dont have the perfect answer this

tried speed dating the other night again wa not great experience this time anyway at end of the event i handed my card to the organiser i think i may have been a bit zoned out  to practice good social etiquette i could have made eye contact smiled and said thanks however i think i only said thanksanyway the point im getting at is i think im zoning out i remember in work i looked at a colleague and she made an uncomfortable expressionlooking back i think i may have been zoned outi think when randomly make eye contact with someone and show no expression it may be seen a bad etiquette sociallyi find that when im handing others back document at work i find it hard to say here you go in a friendly tone i think i say it in an uncomfortable way or i sound serious coldexpressionless which come across awkward make me think is this something that caused me a lot of bad interaction would be interested to hear if others can relate or not,anxiety2753,hey you guy i a  turning  on thursday guy

gone by at this point it seems to have become an extreme social paranoia at time absurd thing such a ohmygod it like they can all hear my intrusive thought it distressing to say the least i had come to believe that the best thing i could do is go ahead and go to college and stay in  apartment im midlate s i cant afford an apartment by myself the idea wa that with social practice id be able to get over it basically but my anxiety ha only gotten worse over this semester it doesnt help that ive made some truly godawful social mistake with my suitemates at this point not even my apartment is a saferelaxing space for me ive thought about maybe trying xanax before socializing ive never used itwith the idea that using the drug to force myself to be calmrelaxed and able to socialize might enable me to form some positive social memory a a basis for overcoming social anxiety more generally but after thinking about the fact that this seems to be something genetic instead of based purely on personal experiencetraumai have to ask is there any chance of becoming a functional person my anxiety get so bad that i slur my speech i cant walk properly i get horribly twitchy and movement become jerky to the point i know that i look like a tweaker my voice tone and volume are all over the place the shadow under my eye become huge i either over or under salivate my eye cant focus it

only place i can mention anything about myself is reddit since i have no friend and no family i can talk to it hard for people to give advice when they dont know you or your circumstance every piece of advice i get is incredibly unhelpful to me if im being honesti dont know how to ask my parent though they dont like me theyve told me this they say im an awful person and stuff and that i do need a therapist havent made me see one their reasoning is a bit off tho theyre really religious and i dont really align with that so yes they think im a bad person and i dont feel like i can ask to see a therapist because of thisi feel like me asking is admitting im a bad person to them and that their warped view of me are true when theyre not at alli also have sibling with who i dont get along with theyre always messing with me and when i get mad and snap at them they yell at me and tell me i have anger issue and that i should see a therapist i dont even hurt them they call slur then i call them smth back and then they cry to my mom about it and then she go on about what a terrible person i am and how it obvious why i have no friendsonce again another reason i cant see a therapist since my sibling would torture me with it theyd know for sure a well since there a high chance my parent would tell themso whats a way i could ask my parent in a way that doesnt make them make fun of me since the biggest thing i want therapy for is my awful social anxiety my mom actually blatantly make fun of my social anxiety so ik shed make fun of me for wanting to go to a therapist for it but im alone

my health teacher actually deducted a lot of point from my actual grade for not raising my hand to participate in class discussion a lot of these topic weve done so far are about mental health he often asks the class question and he doesnt cold call people out to participate but if we choose not to raise our hand and participate in these discussion our grade go down by at least a few  each time we dont participate it really annoying because i do all the extra credit turn in all my assignment but im stuck at a b in this class because i dont feel comfortable enough raising my hand speaking when i feel vulnerable with everyone else looking at me when i speak not only that but because of my social anxiety i zone out a little from what were actually learning and dont have much time to think about what to say i mean i could let the teacher know about my social anxiety but it wouldnt really be fair to other student considering everyone else who doesnt raise their hand to participate also loses point and doesnt question it so i probably wouldnt be the exception so if i want to keep my grade at a satisfactory level i at least need to try,anxiety2808,i have this bad

i wake up with severe anxiety dirraheadue to anxiety and when i wa in school i would throw up due to the anxiety regardless of those statement let get on to the point and i will try and make it short so i recently got a new job  week ago it a job where i have to talk  people over the phone and make sale my bos and other coworkers claimed in order for me to get better they tell me stop being so timid you need to learn to relax after hearing that it made it worse so i decided to statt using my benzo script daily last week i have had a benzodiazepine script for  year but found out the best way not to get withdrawl and become dependant is use once every  day and it ha worked even though this regimen work i am always an anxious wreck on the day i dont take them and kind of judt accepted it at that point the anxiety day been doing this regimen for  yearsbut after everyone always claiming im so anxious timid and whatnot i am considering daily usage so thats why i came to this subreddit should i just accept my fate and use daily for the rest of my life  if my anxiety is this bad  and just disregard the withdrawl story i wont ever have to worry about withdrawl if i dose daily right physical therapist said the same thing tore my acl a while back she said why are you so timid and tight let me do my thing and stretch you out im sick of the anxiety and after  year of having  day out of the week anxiety free with that regimen i told you about after i dosed my benzo daily with this new job last week i got compliment from my bos made massive sale and i can talk to people normally havent had a relationship in  year due to the anxiety i only would go out on the day i would dose with that regimen i told you about also dont try to explain other medication because if you list a medication i  guaruntee you i have tried it from ssri snri maoi gabapentin buspar wellbutrin lyricayou get the point there more i didnt list the only other medication i take which is daily is atenolol

people at all the only thing that eas my anxiety is my caffeine addiction it bad i wish i wa normal,anxiety2812,been reading through the sub and noticed most people fall into the me myself and i mentality of only thinking about themselves and doing so to such an extent that they begin to selfparasitizethis isnt meant to insult anyone  i have been there thinking people are obsessing over my every move and all that stuff but the reality isnobody actually care like that except usby understanding that the selfobsessiveness is what trigger anxiety we can learn to let go and actually step outside ourselves in order to connect to the world and impact it positively or negatively up to youits a kind of quiet insidious narcissism to assume that people actually are obsessed with our every move and will go so far a to feel strong hatred or disapproval over some of our idiosyncrasy of which all people have some by the waysure there are some asshole out there that will bully or pick on you  but thats life malignant psychology ha always existed and if you want to get technical about it  malignant psychology arguably rule or run the world at the highest level war is almost always invariably immoral and deeply fucked in the head when you really think about it  all the atrocity and killing over what resource and politicking not even most of it is just game played by the elite at this pointso should we all just be permadepressed and stuck in a rut because of thatno we have the choice to step outside of the malignancy and embrace the light and love of helping and cooperating with others to enrichen the life that we are blessed to live with think of how lucky we even are to be where we are rather than being bombed or tortured or trafficked somewhere like million of people have beentldr step outside of yourself stop obsessing over yourself help others and the issue will naturally subside i have been in the pit and i know how it feel  the solution isnt to dig deeper but rather like the devil snare from harry potter  you just gotta stop struggling against the thorn and slip through out of the constriction good metaphor in that series,anxiety2813,im so terrified that

to work and home work ha even stopped being a safe place because we have hired so many new people to keep up with the work we have my best friend and i grew apart mainly because i would find excuse after excuse to get out of social gathering eventually he stopped asking he reached out to me because of this party for the first time in quite a while im home alone while my wife and adult son are at

with me,anxiety2821,im  m and i have social anxiety and adhd there may be something else bundled in there but those are the two big thing at the point of writing ive just dipped out of a big night out with some work friend come home and cried because i just didnt feel like i belonged thereive struggled a lot with making friend throughout my life when i wa younger i got bullied a lot for being weird and even the friend group that i did have often chastised me for being overly sensitive a i moved into secondary school a lot of this continued id never felt truly accepted for who i wa and valued a a part of a social group my home life wasnt much better a my house wa a none stop screaming match between my parent and brother so i never really got much exposure to the family group eitheras such i kind of just developed on my own i wa happy enough to do so but i never got to practice my social skill outside of playing with stranger online so ive struggled making friend into my adult life my interest are my own and i have never really had a social group where i share than more than one interest with them i had a group of friend i played halo with online but outside of that there wa nothing else for u to talk about i developed my own taste in music and humour a well not particularly sharing these with anyone a i got oldernow i just find it so damn hard to relate to peopleim not saying i never had friend i had plenty and do a an adult but i dont and didnt feel particularly close to them nobody ever seems to understand my joke or share my interest or understand my point of view it like ive been alienated for so long that i dont even understand how a social group is meant to function most of the time if i interject in a conversation im either interrupted or totally ignored and then i feel like an absolute idiot for even trying to get involvedid really love to feel like an accepted and cherihed part of a group i love socialising when it go well but i find it so exhausting i dont seem to be able to enjoy myself in the way others do and i hate it i have tried so hard to emulate and understand but i just dont know how to fit in im tired of being surrounded by people all the time but feeling completely isolated i dont know why im posting this really i just feel like shit and i guess im wondering if anyone ha any advice how do you cope with

seeing others have company to go eat out with maybe im meant to be alone in this world,anxiety2833,i went to a counselor at my school for a few session then my physician because i wanted to a diagnosis and then maybe get a referral to a therapistpsychiatrist mostly for social anxiety  and other disorder that it led to the lie wa that i never worked on my anxiety i dont know why i said it but both got to social anxiety fairly quickly and explained it to me but i never let them know how familiar i am with it  the whole cbt book medication  this ha been my obsession since i wa in high

honestly feel like i have no more option all ive accomplished is accepting this i still feel inadequate and le than it weird but i dont think thats going away,anxiety2834,i am trying to practice this because we are bound to feel uncomfortable at time even though all of u want to be at a point where we dont feel a high amount of discomfort by social situation maybe the focus should also be in not to try to avoid so much but embrace it not make a big deal from an embarrasing moment be okay from feeling unease at time and training ourselves to be able to move on if it happens rather than training ourselves to never be able to experience it anymore the latter is more impracticali am telling myself i dont have to avoid this person because our last interaction wa awkward i can talk to them again and see it a see it a a chance to override that past interaction with a new and more pleasant one we do let ourselves be defined too much by our awkwardness instead of seeing it a just a moment we had just like everyone else can yes it might happen to u more often or struggle more with it than the average person but it is still a human struggle not a defining quality of a person or at least in my view it doesnt have to be,anxiety2835,hurt every time i read this bc i know i better stay alone all my life,anxiety2836,im  and never ever had even a friend because of this disorder

pretty friend who have had all the attention you can think of while i have been used simply a a tool to get close to them i know that this is really shallow not getting attention from guy isnt the worst thing in the world you have so much to be grateful for yada yadabut it really sting sometimes okay it make me feel so unwanted and like le of a woman ive become so distant from my friend because the moment they get a gfbf i have to share them with this whole new person i have always struggled with self image issue and for those of you who are wondering about my personality all these year of being treated like an outcast have reduced my confidence to zero and my social anxiety is at an all time high the more i face such experience the more awkward it make me it a vicious cycle with no end  i have lost touch with my feminine side i love dressing up and makeup and i do it for myself and it doe make me happy but it doesnt help with how lonely i feel deep down and cherry on top i now have pcod which make it even harder to lose weight and my acne is horrible ive been laughed at before and called ugly to my face and the worst part is i laughed too because i knew it wa true i used to have hobby and love reading but ive recently fallen into a depressive episode and i think ive lost touch of who i am i dont know what to do,anxiety2850,i am bilingual englishspanish and my partner is a well he is a native speaker of both language and grew up in a bilingual home i grew up in an english speaking home but learned spanish a an adult around age  for my careeri have spoken spanish daily for work for  year initially i had severe anxiety over speaking spanish in my career but with the daily reality of using it i became more comfortable a well a more advanced in it i got into a relationship with my partner  year ago he us both language with me i always reply in english because i am most comfortable in english this wa not a problem until one day he expressed that it hurt his feeling that i never speak spanish with him since then i have tried using more but i have found i have so much anxiety over using spanish with him that it make me freeze the thing is because i learned a an adult i have an accent when i speak i dont always know the word i am looking for and i make grammatical error often all normal thing for people who learn a second language but i am so embarrassed of these thing when it come to him hearing them because he is flawless and college educated in both language and it make me feel very stupid to not be at the same level a him like embarrassed to the point of tear at time i know these are irrational thought but i cant get past them at work i kind of am forced to use spanish  the people i speak spanish with at work literally cannot speak english and so i dont feel stupid in that context because i am just doing what i can to communicate with him i can just default to english to avoid my anxiety but i want to push past my anxiety and use spanish with him because i think it will deepen our relationshipi would really like suggestion for how to deal with the freezing sensation i feel and how to push past my anxiety what thing should i do or try i would really value a bilingual relationship with him and i feel like im ruining it i looked online for advice but havent found anything specific to this situation i feel like such an asshole that this is so hard for me maybe spanish language activity or ice breaker we can try together to help me loosen up my anxiety i feel like asking him for help would help me but i dont know what to even ask forthank  you in advance for any help you can give,anxiety2851,if you dont know whats happening you will unnecessarily put yourself lower or people will put you lower and you wont even know

httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvcwhevyybuohttpswwwyoutubecomwatchvcwhevyybuo,anxiety2854,for those of you who are able to bear with me here i really appreciate it if you do i dont know if this is the correct sub to write this in but i really want to lighten my chest and i dont know who to talk to about these feeling so thats why i am writing this here the last  month have been really tough and taxing for me in many way in april last year i went through a divorce with my exwife who i had been married to for  year at that time she suddenly left me one day while i wa at work and i then got a note sent to my home saying that she had filed for divorce behind my back a few day before that at the present moment i am very happy and grateful because the divorce happened but at the time it wa the most difficult thing i had ever went through it came so sudden that it really chocked me and rocked my whole world because at the time me and my exwife had not even been fighting and there wa absolutely nothing suggesting or implying that a divorce would happenfor the following  month i could not eat drink or sleep properly i pretty much did not feel like working or doing anything i didnt want to stay in my apartment because it reminded me of my exwife so i tried to go out and be with friend a much a possible i also started seeing a psychologist to help me go through my feeling and reach emotional recovery i had lot of bad dream and i felt like my whole life wa ruined and that i would never be happy againuntil i suddenly got to know another woman in the beginning of july last year she life abroad and we got to know eachother onlinethis woman wa and is the best person i have ever known in my entire life and we clicked in a way i had never ever in my life experienced or even imagined before we started talking everyday and a long a i wa talking to her everything felt not only fine but completely amazing she gradually made me forget about all the pain i had gone through after my divorce and she made me fall in love with her harder than i had ever fallen in love before she also made me realize how bad my exwife really wa for me and that there are much better option out there obviously i entered into a relationship with this amazing woman and thats something that i am undescribingly proud and happy about and it probably the best decision i have made in my life since she is such a loving and wonderful human being in every waybut me and her have since day one been having to deal with difficult circumstance which we have had little or no control over first of all she come from a very conservative family and life in a very conservative society which is not the case for me therefore when we decided to finally meet for the first time and i travelled to her we had to meet eachother without her family knowing about it which meant that we had to be really careful about where we went and also make up some good lie which she could tell her family also we had to introduce me to her family by telling them lie about how we got to know eachother we had to tell them that i got introduced to her through a male friend of mine while she got introduced to me through a female friend of hers and that we would like to know eachother better and possibly get engaged all these lie and constantly having to think about what we say and do really made me exhausted and emotionally stressed at the time but anyway we got engaged in december  and then i travelled back home to where i liveafter that our plan wa to get married so we can live together and do whatever we want so for the next few month i worked overtime a much a i possibly could morning shift evening shift and night shift just to be able to pay for the wedding and for the dowry which her family demanded from me even though she did not want it i finally managed to gather all the money and travelled to marry her yet in order to get married we had to fix a shitload of paperwork both in the country in which i live and in the country in which she life since she would be marrying a foreigner these paper were expensive and took a lot of effort and time to fix which also caused u both a lot of emotional stress and exhaustion however we finally managed to get married in the end of march this year so we have now been married for approximately  month the problem is that i live in a country far away from hers and she is not allowed to come here without a visa or a residence permit we applied for a residence permit even before we got married but we have been waiting now for almost  month and still did not receive any information therefore we can not even live together so i try to travel to her for a few week every two or three month depending on my work situation the distance and having to be apart from eachother is also killing u and causing u a lot of emotional damage pressure and stresstwo month after we got married in may this year her father passed away after having been sick in cancer for quite some time it wa really hard for her since she and her father were really close i could not stand seeing her sad like she wa when it happened since everything that make her sad make me sad too she is my better half and i love her with all my heart obviously the loss of her father also caused u a lot of emotional stress and pressure and she ha not really recovered from that loss yet when i visited her in october this year her uncle also passed away because of some sickness and there wa even more emotional stress and sadness and now a few day ago she told me that her brother who also ha had cancer for quite some time is basically lying on his deathbed and could die at any moment she did not fully recover yet from the death of her father and now there is a firm possibility that her brother might also pas away soon  she is of course very sad and not feeling well and it kill me to see it i want to help her and i want to do something to help her feel better but i just dont know what i can do it just horrible to see these thing happening to her and her family and obviously this is causing even more emotional pain and distresstomorrow is her th birthday i had planned on celebrating it and doing something funny together and trying to make her happy but now she is just sad and not even her birthday could cheer her up i am constantly thinking about her constantly afraid that something might upset her make her feel sad that something might not be right that there is something that can cause problem in our marriage or make u feel bad for any reasoni feel like i cant take it anymore i cant take all the thinking the fear the pressure the emotional stress and pain i feel emotionally exhausted i dont know what i am going to do i just want to relax and be happy together with the love of my life ,anxiety2855,i ran into this freshman from ny campus fencing club in a fast food place a few min ago we have talked before in the past but not much and

time sharing about it on social medium take a moment to think about this assume that it true for a moment and you will find all the answer that you are looking for,anxiety2857,i didnt believe this until last year i always thought god doesnt  internally take away our emotion of depression or anxious but rather  help u externally by directing u to tool or people that can help u  but i learned from my experience and from christian testimonial god  actually internally remove these mental or physical disorder sort of  like a taking a magic pill from god   sometimes i get wave of sadness or intrusive thought that wont stop  no matter what i do or med i take unless i pray they finally go away  immediately it hit or miss though doesnt work all the time im so  early in my journey though they say it take time before god finally  dive to give a big removal of these emotion once your faith grows i  believe this because it ha been going just like that once i stopped  being super skeptical   in youtube there is a massive amount christian testimonial of people  god interntally healed from depression anxiety schizophrenia etc  from just reading bible and praying these christian personal account  will make you know that god can remove these negative feeling from you  without needing psychology doctor or medication not saying that  these treatment dont work   additionally in separate occasion i met a few a separate guy who said  just by reading the bible their schizophrenia stopped without needing  to take any med my mom few year ago got schizophrenia out of no  where med helped her however after praying and reading bible alot her  schizophrenia vanished without needing to take med no more it will  take time waiting on god so be patient guy   remember to watch christian testimonial they really show you the healing power of god that you wouldnt imagine   god bless,anxiety2858,it not most of the time and i acknowledge it could be me overthinking but last

the idea of working and in a way im happy that i am unemployable and unable to work a social life seems very stressful to me having friend and relationship feel like it would be a responsibility the thought of always having to keep friend happy with the friendship and having to be available to talk stress me out since i enjoy my current lifestyle i have very litlle motivation to improve and work on my social anxiety however there are still time once in a while where i either really want to be able to talk to others even if i dont want to get too close to them or am forced to so my social anxiety is still an issue it just hard to find motivation to work hard on something that only affect you sometimes,anxiety2867,i wa socially anxious since childhood till th grade i changed my class section and finally had some friend i started feeling confident started participating in activity talking to new people cracking joke and mainly i wa having fun in th grade when lockdown came i realized ive been suppressed my negative emotion for too long and i started becoming aware that im also a people pleaser and it wa since my childhood i started questioning myself and i fell into ptsd

skill but the effect only manifested when i started facetoface class in med school at first it felt good making new friend both acquaintance and close one the first three week went well but after that personal drama start to arise i thought i wa mature enough to ignore it considering that this unnecessary drama could add up to mental stress on top of the academic demandsso from a group of  friend i end up having  and eventually down to  close friend and the weirdest thing is that i feel jealous seeing other circle in our class going solid with their friendship i feel like me cutting friend that i dont vibe with wa a total mistake like maybe im the problem although i am doing well academically i feel like everyone else around is growing up but me and when i go to my apartment after class i feel extremely lonely one night at am i woke up having shortness of breath earlier than that i had a sudden breakdown right before our afternoon class i dont want to bother any of my classmate or

distant yourself to someone who tried to ask you out but you werent interested im not sure if i should still text her a she still seems interested in conversing even in the midst of sending those

write everything in this post but i will keep it shortbasically im now able to handle any social situation with comfort the reason why we get social anxiety is we convinced our mind tobe shameful and not enough once you find god youre sub conscious realises you are enough and you no longer feel threat sociallythought i would write this post to clarify that this is treatable although it may not eradicate  it definitely will allow you to live life again,anxiety2873,he asked if i had an account and i said yes he sent the link but i havent joined yet im worried that if i join ill say nothing

went to a private school from kgth grade and didnt keep in touch with anyone th grade did online for th grade i wa actually enrolled late so i started  week late so off to a bad starti have really bad social anxiety and i like to think it improved a bit i no longer have a really shaky voice when i talk and can answer stuff normally i still have trouble actually starting conversation and staying in those conversation thoughmy main goal next semester is to make friend but im unsure how to go about it my next semester class are also more social than the one i have right now such a pe and a tv production course so im hoping ill be forced out of my comfort zone and get to interact with people im anxious about the whole thing though next semester is in late january so any tipsmainly want to know how to just talk to people since i get told that a lot but i genuinely dont understand how to do that i have a really hard time branching out conversation outside of just classwork such a soon a were done with our work classmate chat with each other and stop talking to me and id like that to change,anxiety2876,were people with talent and unique trait and we sit by ourselves instead of going out on the weekend this cannot go on forever were held hostage by our mind it like an invisible force field that keep u behind a certain point missing out on priceless experience were going to want back funny thing is when we actually do what we fear it end up being ok even if it not and for a split second during a conversation we feel normal it only fade back because were used to it in a way it an addiction weve developed overtime what if it is a type of addiction we can be free from after all the best and most brilliant mind seem to face the most adversity imagine if we broke this addiction how fucking great would you be how would you affect the world around you i bet youd leave in the dust all the people you compare yourself too  all the thought that you have when approaching a situation imagine those were not there at all i bet we have thought and behavior were so used too now we dont notice them it would be a weight lifted to say the very least how great would you be why dont you you know deep down tonight ive stayed inside my roommate went out he asked me three time if i wanted to go i stayed inside not because i wa tired not because i didnt feel like drinking not because i didnt want to hang out with my roommate im sitting alone again and im used to it a part of me like it of course it sad though it legit make me sad this isnt living where do we start how do we fix this there is nothing wrong with u how fucking great would you be i know id be so great kind funny caring confident good looking fearless and so much more it hurt sometimes i think ive missed the train in my life and only a time machine would change my circumstance it just another thought thats let me down it almost like an addiction we can become free from it almost like we could be our best friend again why dont we if we can do this great at digging ourselves deep into social anxiety then we can surely be successful if we tried going the other direction nobody ever offer solution you are your solution who better to trust with helping you it gotta start with being our own best friend no matter if a whole crowd point at u and laugh to get there i think we monitor our thought a best we can how would you talk to your best friend thats how you talk to yourself no matter what consistency will pay off just like it did to develop our social anxiety this time well go the other direction from here we need to pick up healthy habit we enjoy remember were still good friend with ourselves so even anxious thought that try to stop u and other people arent a intimidating we know we have our back no matter what overtime we can slowly expose ourselves to more with this plan it not overnight but it damn sure better than growing old and wishing we had a time machine,anxiety2877,for  and  year now ive been suffering from tic like one with tourette might have only i dont have tourette and they happen because of the many badsadscaryhumiliating memory that continue to torture me into midadulthood flooding my thought triggered by either a song word or object that ha meaning to whichever bad memory i lay in bed trying to clear my mind and relax so that i can fall asleep while already dealing with  year of severe insomnia but one after another the trauma that exists in my memory force it way into my head and give me the more intense urge to yell any random word relevant to the story or not a though im trying to immediately sprint for a way out my sanity and overall mental health is being chipped away even faster now than it already ha been for so many year the feeling of being absolutely trapped in the painful emotion of these memory is hell and i am miserable on my page youll see the muzzlesoundmuffler i made tonight after an especially severe attack ive read other post from people who suffer from the same thing and while i dont wish this on anyone it an incredibly good and just comforting feeling to know others feel the pain i experience from this disorder i guess one could call it hopefully this post doe the same thing for someone else who is also searching for others to connect with and it make them feel le alone and more understood if you read this whole thing thank you very much and i hope that whatever journey youre on to understand your feeling and emotion better will lead you to the solution that finally unlocks your freedom to live the happy life that you and so many of u who are mentally ill deserve,anxiety2878,i have always hated meeting and workshop that actually force you to participate and other people hearing your opinion if youre being put on the spotlight thats why i am so relieved i am now an adult and no longer need to be in class with all the judgmental people around you and now there this upcoming thing thats needed for my job it only for a couple hour and im dreading it so bad what usually happens in this,anxiety2879,my neighbour puppy got into myrecycling and ate some paper i have a dog and would want to know right away if she ate something so i called my neighbour but they didnt pick up so just knocked on their door and showed them the paper and how big the piece i think the dog ate wouldve been is this over board concern wa it rude to knock on their door i had just talked to my neighbour about  minute before this because they came outside with their dog while i wa out with mine then i noticed about  min later i thought it might be an emergency since their dog is so little and just got spayed but they didnt seem concerned at all  now im anxious i annoyed them by knocking wah i hate anxiety and really just trying to be a great tenant because i love this place i moved my recycling from the ground where they told me to put and instead put it on an upper shelf to keep it away from their puppy would you dislike me if i wa your tenant i rarely reach out to them for anything,anxiety2880,i just want to talk to some people while i play video game or just listen becuase id be too nervous to talk,anxiety2881,it been a long time since i last received a compliment back then my anxiety wasnt a strong a it is now so i didnt think this could be a problem today i received one and i surprised myself by not being able to react at all i didnt know what to answer every time i wa about to say something another part of my mind would give me a reason not to say it becoming extremely paranoid about what the other person might think if i didnt give a proper answer in the end i couldnt say anything because of overthinking and the moment ended with me looking at him for  second it stupid but this is not letting me sleep to the point that right now i am gradually losing control of my thought,anxiety2882,yepview pollhttpswwwredditcompollzbzd,anxiety2883,i am a college senior who basically ha no friend and no social connection beyond workschoolother professional relationship i spend most of my day alone other than talking to my family i have no problem conversing with people at work and at school and actually think that i get along well with people but whenever someone asks to hang out or spend time with me outside of those comfortable situation i start panicking and make up excuse to get out of it almost a a reflex and end up regretting it later on because i really feel that im missing genuine and meaningful connection in my life for example one of my friend from high school wa visiting my college town and wanted to get lunch with me however her boyfriend who ive never met before wa going to join u and i immediately made up an excuse about having work at the time they were going to be in town because i didnt want to put myself in an awkward situation the other day one of my classmate offered me a ride home and i declined it saying i still had stuff to take care of on campus when i didnt and even though i hate commuting home on the bus during rush hour however the fear of not knowing what to say while spending time one on one with her freaked me out i am becoming more and more withdrawn and i dont know how to get myself out of this cycle part of it is academic stress since i feel really angry with myself and beat myself up over it when i spend my time doing anything other than studying but part of it is also the fear that i will do something weird or embarrassing and people wont like me anymore for it if anyone ha experienced something similar and ha advice for me i would really appreciate it,anxiety2884,when i get anxious i have a roster of rehearsed one off answer at the back of my mind at all time in case people approach me for whatever reason absolutelyyeah no kiddingfor sure thats it short utterance not said with an ounce of personality or thought wont go out of my way to expand on the conversation because i know if i say anything else im gonna stutter and have to repeat myself and i become a mess from there and people look at me funny or think im just trying to get rid of them which i kind of am but not because of anything personal,anxiety2885,im a junior in college with social anxiety and often have trouble opening up to others i always see group of friend laughing and enjoying their time together and ive always longed to have that but i feel really incapable maybe i seem really strange to other people i try to be friendly but i dont think im doing a good job and my roommate is kind of cold the few friend ive managed to make never really show much interest in me or try to hang out with me i just feel like if i be vulnerable with others and show how i am theyll just not reciprocate and it just a oneway street of me constantly reaching out to people who dont really give a flying f about me i wish i had more friend doe anyone feel the same way what do i do it kind of embarrassing to admit online i could never even talk about it in person i fear rejection from people i wasnt always this way i wa quite bold and daring a a kid i think i became this way because of how people treated me in the past,anxiety2886,one thing ive been thinking about doing since i first started college wa a study abroad program  im double majoring in public health and spanish and my college doesnt charge extra tuition for study abroad although roomboardflight fee are understandably separate after extensive discussion with my academic and major advisor i chose a program for this upcoming spring that really excites me applied and got accepted  it based in argentina and i stay with a host family while im there plus the course are all taught in spanish so i boost my comprehension but all the class are focused on public health so i get elective major credit im into epidemiology and it an urban epidemiologypublic health policy program mainly based in buenos aire but we also do a couple of excursion to a few other place in argentina to check out the public health system in place and the latter part of the program includes an internship that also count a my public health major capstone aaaaaaaaaaa im so excitedive been working on stepping out of my social anxiety bubble more and more this semester and i think that going abroad next semester will be another big step forward  i know it will be difficult but i mentioned on the form i filled out so they match me with a suitable host family that im a big introverthave social anxiety and will need time to myself to recharge plus i really enjoy taking solitary walk and listening to music to clear my head so im not too stressedalso a a surprise christmas gift to my parent ive already booked and paid for my flight tofrom argentina i had a zoom meeting with one of my university advisor who specifically advises in the travel booking for study abroad and she wa super helpful  it cost me  actually lower than expected but im glad i can pay for that and take some of the stress off my parent now the only added cost compared to studying on campus is  and i can chip in towards that too im so excited to print out the flight info and give it to them my sister already know and theyre excited for me too ,anxiety2887,im a college student who been here for  month my friend group is always talking about party and who throwing i honestly dont get it they talk about it a if it something enjoyable that they want to do i ask them what do you even do there and i get some vague answer like socializing and meeting people do they just go up to people and start talking my friend dont seem super extroverted or socially adept theyre just normal i feel like id have no idea what to do at a party and when i dont know what to do i start freaking out a little bit,anxiety2888,im on medication now and now processing everythingive always considered myself an ambivert or mostly introvert but i wa thinking what if i didnt have social anxiety would i be more extroverted not saying that all introverted people have social anxietyi would say i used to be a pretty shy person before social anxiety but i would get more comfortable with like relationship a time went on with them anyways i found out that when im hanging out with people i always feel really energetic and confident after i usually dont like big crowd but prefer smaller group and person to person but i guess it would really depend the peopleperson or how i felt on that specific day i would say i have a problem when being left out and i used to think it wa fine but now it really not that fun i find that i actually like getting involved in conversation rather than being left out i also have a huge fear of being judged too but ive been feeling more positive and careless in a good way these day i used to have severe separation anxiety i would also have problem being ignored and being abandonedi need my alone time there and now but i think the most important thing is that i need to try to not label myself and force myself to live on one side from the other but just to live life and do whatever i wantim probably just feeling more positive and happy these day tricking myself into thinking im an extrovert because of the extrovert are happy and bright stereotype not saying that introvert are depressed and gloomy,anxiety2889,when i wa younger around  grade i remember being really nervous in social situation  i would get anxiety about every last move i made like getting up to get a tissue drinking water at the water fountainor from my water bottle i wa embarrassed of the crinkling noise and what i looked like walking to the fountain playing sport in pe the way i wrote for god sake  i wa avoiding social gathering at church dreading going to school every morning it kept me up at night just thinking about having to go anywhere where there were people  i felt depleted in this time im a sophomore now   and it just disappeared i couldnt care le about what people think of me  did i just mature or something  i can comfortably talk to people and the silence doesnt bother me anymore i only conversate with people out of consideration for their comfort  i have also noticed an extreme spike in my confidence i hardly care what i look like anymore ive accepted who i am  i feel so free i dont know how i did it but i feel liberated and new,anxiety2890,so i never had any social anxiety until high schoolhigh school wa my first coed environment and i started blushing whenever i felt

friend that celebrate my birthday with me and i always pictured my st birthday being like a big fun party with some friend to have a great time with but my time in college ha been met with a lot of acquaintance rather than friend a they feel more or le like coworkers almost and ive tried putting myself out there but being rejected so many time ha been mentally exhausting i just feel like a waste to society tomorrow is just gonna suck being alone on what is supposed to be such a special day i always thought id finally have some lifelong friend at this point but i guess not im just running out of way to be happy anyways for anyone also studying for final right now in school good luck,anxiety2920,i found someone who helped my social anxiety she understood it and literally made me feel so much better about myself she made sure if i wa uncomfortable shed be by my side in social situation at party shed always stick with me and rarely leave my side i genuinely though i had found my soulmate shed cheered me on when i wa literally so anxious i wa about to be sick before interview and then she cheated she said it wa a mistake and blamed it on her bipolar but i just couldnt deal with the thought i said im done and blocked her on everything but i miss her so fucking much i feel alone and empty i think  i did the right thing but life just isnt right i feel like i lost a part of me that ill never get back,anxiety2921,it pretty upsetting knowing all my issue are in my head and im the only person keeping myself from being more social rationally i know no one paying attention to me if im for example shopping in a store alone but i just cant bring myself to be alone in a store for some reason trying to order food well i cant do that i dont know why it not like the employee are gonna laugh in my face and make fun of my order so i genuinely dont know what my issue isschools are another big one a really dumb thing is sometimes when im sitting in class and someone change the way theyre sitting ie put their elbow on the desk and rest their head in their hand i wont change the way im sitting at all because i think it look like im copying them i straight up will sit for at least  minute in an uncomfortable position because of this  obviously i know not a single person would think that and there a  they dont even notice me changing the way im sittingi also breathe weirdly sometimes ill take incredibly shallow breath so no one can hear me breathing i have no clue why i do this in fact it make it worse since i end up needing to breathe so i end up huffing so if anything it backfire but i cant help it and ive tried to stop and sometimes and can but not always the whole thing is just so dumb i hate how im like this and while my social anxiety is still pretty bad it not nearly a bad a it wa a few month ago wa prompted to write this since im starting my second semester in late january and my main goal is to be more social and actually make some friend but i know i probably wont be able to actually converse with people because of all this irrational shit i have going on everyone ive talked to at all ha been nice to me a well so it not like people are just awful and rude at my school and im afraid theyll say shit to me since there no rational reason that would happeneither way im going to try really hard next semester to be more social it a pretty big school a well  kid over  in my grade and of course we have overlapping class with other grade so my supposed friend opportunity are actually pretty big and i wanna try really hard not to let my social anxiety ruin the rest of my high school year since i know it irrational and there no reason it should keep me from having a social life,anxiety2922,i take you somewherewe will go to a beach house

school i never got involved in activity and dropped out of college twice because of it i did ok for a while and then around  or  after some issue with a coworker of mine it flared the worst that it had ever been i decided that i wa time to seek professional help and started seeing a psychiatrist over the past decade weve tried almost a dozen different med and two different therapist and nothing ha helped i joined the local volunteer fire department back in  it wa something that i wa always interested in and an opportunity presented itself so i took it and i eventually became an emt a well after being on the department for about  year my anxiety once again started flaring up every time we got a call i would almost have a panic attack and it got to the point that i stopped running call and eventually resigned i wa on medication for anxiety during the last several year of my time with the department about ten year ago i had to quit the warehouse job i wa working due to back issue i got a job at the local grocery store that i worked at in high school and have worked my way up to meat department manager none of this wa through me actively trying one of the meat cutter quit about seven year ago and they asked me if id like to take his place then about five year ago the meat department manager retired and they just kind of gave the job to me im really more of a glorified meat cutter than anything else a i dont have the ability to hire or fire anyone not that id want to anyway however i am in charge of ordering everything that we need for the department and i have to keep on top of price change and thing like that much like with the fire department i thought exposing myself to people and situation would help with my anxiety and people skill it also ha only made thing worse i have constant anxiety worrying about what type of interaction im going to have with customer and coworkers throughout the day how many rude and difficult people im going to deal with or people that cant or dont want to understand why i cant do certain thing mostly due to cross contamination or why i dont have a certain product i wake up multiple time a night and cant get back to sleep because of worrying i have gone over dozen of scenario in my head a to how something may play out question that customer may ask thing they want done etc every single time im put in that position even if it happens exactly like i had planned my mind go completely blank and i fumble through the entire conversation i have never had a situation turn out like i wanted every one of them end awkwardly with me not saying or doing anything resembling what i wanted i have always been afraid of confrontation and dealing with people every day ha not helped at allthis is just a small example of what i

worthyis this really mesound familiarwelcome to imposter syndrome youre in good company nigella lawson michelle obama lady gaga and lily allen have all shared their imposter syndrome experience publicly but what is this demonits an umbrella term under which life one or more limiting belief such a those generalised one above they may be accompanied by more specific belief these are typically formed rationally in childhood and a child may serve u well for example i need everyone to approve of me  to be a valued i must succeed in everything i do it is not ok for me to make mistake if i do i am bad i can feel happy in life without contributing back in some way everyone need to rely on someone stronger than themselves i shouldnt have to feel sadness discomfort and pain someone somewhere should take responsibility for mewhat would your own list look likehowever time move on and thing change a we become adult our childhood belief serve u le well  and the resultant behaviour may be incongruent with the situation we are in this lead to the conclusion that one of the thing it mean to grow up is to develop out of our childhood belief and adopt a new set of belief that will serve u better a adult this progression follows a broad pattern of developing from dependence a child to independence a young adult to interdependence a mature adult our overall set of belief are developing all the time however most of u will carry some of our childhood belief with u in to adulthood most of these will be innocuous most of the time but some of them will sometimes impede our performance a high functioning interdependent adult a adult we benefit from identifying our limiting belief and growing in to more valuable belief by way of an example a common limiting belief sitting under the imposter syndrome umbrella is i must compare myself to others which can be reframed to i live my own life on my own term or i have a unique set of character strength a do others in turn the reframed belief can underpin valuable affirmation such a because i live my own life i enjoy the success of others or i choose to celebrate my success without reference to others accomplishment or the fact that i choose to live my life authentically mean i only compare myself against my own standard,anxiety2932,ive actually made a pretty good work friend she is very outgoing but always is nice to me and

awkward introverted person i cannot stress how awkward i am never dated anyone before hell i can barely speak to people now i also realise you shouldnt ask anyone out when theyre working but man my plan wa to write a note with my name and phone number give it to her colleague and tell her a few thing about me to pas on pretty much that one scene from public enemy where john dillinger list the thing he like but im such a coward i couldnt even do this last week when i went to drop off my frame for reglazing i have my last chance to do something about this when i go to pick up my glass the whole paper and colleague idea is good and cute according to my female friend it also le awkward for both of usive thought of many way that i could go about asking her out i always ask myself how id feel if i were her and some random fella i gave an eye test to came back and asked me out it would be awkward and embarrassing not to mention be embarrassing for me too a the optician is located inside a supermarket guess id have to purchase my shampoo from elsewheredoes anyone have any word of encouragement i usually tell myself to go tom cruise mode or daniel plainview mode if im afraid or find it difficult to say something it helped in the past but not this time,anxiety2971,im heading to brisbane this week with my sister and her husband for a music festival im beyond excited cause

sentence wa shaking like crazy wasnt even making sense i havent had that happen to me in year although it used to in h and college stage fright is something i thought i conquered but now i find myself panicking every time i need to speak at work a total fight or flight reaction i feel that my reputation is ruined it like i have lost  year of progress i cant even look at myself in the mirror without just this giant weight of shame of everything i feel ive lost for myself professionally because of my own internal struggle i feel like i dont deserve anythingdoes anyone have this problem how have

terrified i deadass wa shaking and it never this bad in real life usually it just awkward and more internally bad but i wont feel like i cant speak but for some reason via game chat mw ill have moment where it feel like every bone in my body is trying it hardest to prevent the ability to even open my mouth and that sinking gut feeling is always there the people ive met so far  people a teammate in duo were cool not mean at all i spoke to them even with this overwhelming feeling i did get really nervous sometimes but i mean im trying so i wont be the best right off the bat one guy did call me a pussy and told me i didnt know shit but i told him something back and it wa fine im going to play another match right now even though i feel like im going to throw up im gonna speak and everything and hope it becomes easier with time because i just want to have fun like everybody else not feel like im on the edge of a cliff god im so scared rn idek why but im proud too i talked this through with my therapist a well they said to just go for it and i am  even if im doing it terrified,anxiety2984,ive had social anxiety a long a i can remember when i wa little it wa very severe i couldnt call anyone talk to stranger eat in front of anyone or even use a public bathroom i made a lot of small step over the year to push outside my comfort zone between that and a few year of therapy i am finally going to a local toastmaster club and doing public speaking in front of stranger voluntarily im starting to make some friend there and i came home tonight with tear in my eye because im so proud of how far ive come the anxiety is still pretty strong but im living my life anyways and thing are looking up,anxiety2985,i have a lot of unorganized thought so i will try my best to compartmentalize what i think is going on in my head into separate paragraph  section also i understand that this post will make me seem like an asshole but i genuinely believe that the coping i am engaging with is the only reason i have not ended my life already so please be mindfuli m have been chronically depressed for over seven year first diagnosed freshman year of highschool  but struggling well before then i have many issue that i have either worked through or come to term with but none are so debilitating a the nervousness i feel when interacting with someone my agei find it nigh on impossible to interact with someone if any three of the four are true they are female they are attractive they are around my age they are in a group  are openly socially activei have come to cope with this by basically only making friend who i feel are securely le attractive than myself i have a couple trait that i feel are commonly valued such a being fairly smart fairly attractive tall athletic and personable this allows me to put on the faade of confidence easily when dealing with people who i believe have deficiency in at least one of those trait i can pretty much write off any guy through this copethey are probably le intelligent than me gt making them le attractivethey are not femaleif theyre smarter than me then hopefully ive already come to like them by the time i realize that if thats the case then usually my anxiety subsides and im able to interact with them normallyhowever woman are much harder for me to cope with for multiple reason they have historically been much le forgiving following a poor first impression at least in my experience i have not had to many positive interaction with woman platonically i have had no success with woman romantically aside from one case i have even le common interest with them than most guy a very few are interested in mathematics  stem amp of those who do few are interested in the same hobby a methe experience i have had with woman have made it stressful to interact with them by itself while it insane to say i genuinely am scared of pretty girl not because they will hurt me but because of  trauma all that aside i have asked a dozenodd girl out throughout my life and not a single one ha reciprocated any feeling the first one or two might have been cringe but i genuinely have just had bad luck with those that i try to ask out perhaps i wasnt a attractive a i am now and im looking back on it with shaded glass but nonetheless my lack of success in actual dating ha somewhat scared me away from even asking girl out this ha resulted in a severe dryspell for me with no attempt at asking a girl out in over a yearthe only time i have ever dated someone it wa a girl who told me she liked me she said that she liked it when i played piano and she found that extremely attractive but it not like there a piano waiting nearby whenever i see a pretty girl it wa a chance interaction and i have yet to successfully swoon a girl even unintentionally or unaware i havent really taken any time to find anything else that would make me attractive to others outside of that i dont go to the gym although i am fairly fit from regular activity and i dont diet so my physical attractiveness is based mainly on my genetics and skincare but i dont see why it is that even the ugly girl dont find me attractive maybe i am intimidating with my rbf but i cant help itas a result my cope tree doesnt really work since while most of the time i assume theyre le intelligent than me i am driven at least somewhat subconsciously by my sexual urge to find them attractive if a woman is in my mind  guaranteed uglier than me i can cope by assuming theyre dumber than me but if shes attractive she might be dumber or smarter and the halo effect tends to get the better of me i assume theyre smarter solely because theyre pretty if they give off genuinely stupid vibe i can somewhat cope but if they seem even the slightest bit reserved i view them a a better and more attractive person than me in pretty much every regardi also struggle with group although this ha kind of gone away a i have realized i struggle more with group that i am not already familiar with you kind of just have to be there at the start of the group or attend group meeting regularly in order to get familiar with everybody and the attitude they put forward when gathered while i have gotten better about speaking in group setting this is mostly confined to discussion on mathematics where i have the upper hand over my peer and they look to me for instruction  correction but a long a i remain in conversation on topic that i am somewhat familiar with i can speak confidently and add to the subject if not ive accepted i will be the dumbass and just ask question of others in order to keep it going the trick work well but it kind of requires two different attitude for the different type of conversation thing im educated on v uneducated on when dealing with a group of stranger however i am immediately put into fightflightfreeze mode and i just try my best to ignore the concept of them even existing the more people there are the worsethe most important thing i must emphasize is that it is almost a if i am not in control of my action when i am stressed like this for the most part i will do anything within my power to end the interaction a smoothly and quickly a possible i dont look at them i dont speak to them i just get through with what i have to do then get on with my life but i feel genuine panic for the minute that i spend interacting with strangerswhile i know there is a path for me to develop confidence i have no clue what it is and despite my empty advice for others on this page i still lack it myself perhaps confidence is something that cant be achieved fully but the way that my nervousness occurs genuinely shake me to my core and i think that unless i somehow become the walking embodiment of confidence i will always remain a somewhat weak man perhaps thats okay in others eye but they havent felt fear at a social interaction they havent felt scared by a normal person looking at them and talking to them saying nothing intimidating but nonetheless afraid to their coregot really rambleey at the end sorry,anxiety2986,warning very long post ahead so for background info i am a f i have been doing online school since i wa in th grade because of really bad social anxiety that led to bad grade cry everyday self harm etc for a while it really helped i finally have good grade im graduating high school a year early and technically not much stress at all time for my hobby and stuff yet i feel stressed all the time due to having no purpose and feeling like a failure i have never been able to keep a friend because the moment i open up to them about sensitive thing i push them away due to being afraid of burdening them and having to deal with consequence of them judging me i also have trust issue because everyone end up abandoning me when im no longer useful to them because i am boring and offer nothing in a friendship i guess i lost my somewhat best friend of  year due to just blocking them on everything because i felt so bad about cancelling plan on them every time and ghosting them i couldnt stand the fact that i wa such a terrible friend to them and such a coward they are better off without me although i wish that wasnt true now i have barely one friend i say barely because i dont even think they really consider me more than an acquaintance honestly because they never want to do anything together nobody made any effort to stay in contact with me after i left school either i am the only one who put in effort and stress myself out in relationship just to get nothing back it doesnt help that i also cant drive anywhere or get my license to get out and have a job because despite trying to learn for  year now every time i get behind the wheel i have a panic attack where i break into tear and i am so ashamed in front of everyone that i dont talk after that not to mention every time i finally gather the courage to apply for a job i back out at the last second or withdraw my application because i get so anxious about if i get accepted and have to do something out of my comfort zone i dont want to burden others with having to go out of their way to take me to work either but at the same time my comfort zone is not very comfortable and it is ruining me im depressed nearly everyday some day i dont even do any school work i have no passion or drive for a career absolutely zero clue on what im going to do or want to do with my life i wish i had friend i wish i could drive i wish i had a job i wish i could have a real life outside of my house ive considered seeing and therapist or psychiatrist but my parent wont take my problem seriously so i have no way of getting to one my mom literally only want me to see a naturopathic doctor or take herb ffs basically i just feel like im the world biggest failure and my life is wasting away im not sure how to get past my anxiety of having to interact with people make mistake and be judged how can i get more comfortable with making mistake and being judged how do i stop always feeling like burden and move on please give me any advice possible,anxiety2987, i go to college in a college town but im a commuter i want to ask my work friend if she want to go to the bar in town but i would have to stay at her apartment if i drank since i wouldnt be able to drive home that night weve hung out outside of work twice and we talk pretty regularly outside of work but im just not sure if it socially appropriate and if it would seem like i wa inviting myself over i would really appreciate any feedback because i want to break out of my comfort zone and ask for this but im just not sure if it rude,anxiety2988,i know this sound extreme but i feel like i dont deserve to live im always looked down on by others because of my anxiety and no matter how hard i try it never go away im constantly the left out one in group and it make me want to cry why wa i made this way it so unfair that everyone else just behaves their normal self and everyone accepts them while i struggle so much i wish i could just cease to exist so all this pain would go away,anxiety2989,i feel like my anxiety hold me back from talking in group and it cause other people to disrespect and dislike me because of it ive tried so hard to fix it but it still there,anxiety2990,doe anyone else have hearing loss which cause extreme anxiety when socialising especially in noisy place,anxiety2991,whenever im in group i am absolutely terrified of talking and because of this when i do talk i often get word mixed up stutter mispronounce word or just sound tense i realised this is because of a few reason one being because i hate revealing thing about myself  my thought to people i dont know well secondly because i just dont have good conversational skill the problem is is that ive tried literally everything and progress is minimal ive realised that other people dislike people who are shy so i just need to be confident in whatever i say but it so hard and scaryanother issue is that im not very funny i feel like im le interesting to talk to than everyone else im almost always the left out one in group setting and i know it because im too scared to talk so people look down on me and think im weak and pathetic because of it people are always super nice to me at first but when they realise i have anxiety they kick me to the curb and it really hurt i just dont know what to do i feel like such a failure of a human being because it seems like no one is like this except me,anxiety2992,i see alot of people on this sub saying how they go to college and have no friend but how do you even go to college with hella lot of people around,anxiety2993,i got my first real job a a barista at a starbucks kiosk with the intention that maybe it would help me branch out a bit and become more social it ha helped a little but i still feel like shit every day of my life everyone i work with is

had any interest today careerwise and i felt like such shit telling her that nothing interested me the truth is im interested in a lot of thingspsychology veterinary medicine computer science film and editing etc but i cant see myself in any of these career because the only way i can leave my house is for work i cant go to a fucking drive through i cant go to any other grocery store i cant go anywhere without having someone with meso i guess theyre right school isnt for everyone some of u are too fucking mentally ill to go to school no matter how much we want to,anxiety2994,im  in my

presentation on tuesday and even though i only have to present  slide for like  minute im so incredibly fucking nervous when i get close to presentation date it all i can think about it and i start

of my mind im still nervous a shit ive even tried taking thing like phenibut which help a little but still doesnt solve my crazy anxiety over the situation,anxiety3004, i m came to a new public high

am awkward and weak like maybe i said the wrong thing and thats not something people say in small talk i dont know i feel ashamed and embarrassed maybe i should realize thats it okay to say thing or anything and that they arent even thinking about me it just part of social anxiety right where you think you embarrassed yourself by saying weird stuff when in fact maybe it wasnt that bad i like to think of it that way,anxiety3023,due to my social anxiety i have avoided talking to people a much a i can for the past few year and now i dont even know how to do it anymore i mean i can get through a few polite sentence and friendly smile but soon it get so exhausting that i retreat into my shell very quickly become the weird lonely person that people ignore or treat a if im invisiblei had literally one friend in college but i wa content with it we used to talk laugh study and having just one person who seemed to like being with you wa enough for the past few week though thing have changed that one friend start finding new better friend and now everytime im with them it very obvious they would rather have anyone el company and is just too polite to tell me soi wanted to tell this to someone but since im now a burden on the one person who had time for me i have no choice but to keep it to myself it just so frustrating to keep pretending like everything is fine i have no social skill to compensate for my lack of academic gift and every day i hope thing might change but they never do some day i can pretend to be a normal person but the very next day thats delusion is shattered how long am i supposed to keep up with thissorry for the rant and thanks if u took the time to read this just writing this stuff here make me feel a little lighter even though i know it wont solve anything,anxiety3024,today i had to sit for a final exam and when we had finished my professor said we could either wait for our score or go home and find out later so i decided to stay it wa approximately  am when i finished and sat down outside the classroom to wait i waited until around  pm and one of my classmate asked the professor how much longer we needed to wait he said min so in the meantime she and her friend decided to go have lunch in the cafeteria since i wa alone because my friend left she invited me to go with them i went with them and i got my food last therefore i wa the last to finish eating during the meal they talked about thing i had no idea about so i wa silent the whole time there were like  of them too which made it harder for me to speak up when they wanted to go back to waiting i wa still eating but they said they would wait for me which made me feel rushed and on top of that i wa full so what did i do i rushed to finish eating and when i did i just stood there waiting for anyone to notice i had finished eating fortunately for me the girl that invited me did so we went back and got our exam score when we were all ready to leave i wa wondering if i should leave first or not i went to the toilet instead and  of them went too after leaving the toilet without saying anything to any of them we went down in the elevator the others were waiting for them at the entrance of the university i started panicking because i wanted to say goodbye to them but they were in a circle and were like  people so i walked a few step away looked at them one of them glanced at me approached them again hesitating to say goodbye but didnt and quietly and slowly left i wa so embarrassed that i rushed home and when i wa getting off the subway i kinda bumped into the door with my arm which made my day a little worse it wa a day in which my social anxiety won i just hope they dont think im rude and ignore peoplewell thats the story i just needed to

like that then he got upset saying i wa invalidating his mental health and that he doe struggle and saying i wa just seeing it from an outside view and that he didnt talk to those people after class yada yada yada but is it so wrong to be upset because st of all i cant talk to anyone nd i made no friend and have not had a new friend since the th grade and  feel like i struggle socially way more which make sense with why i got diagnosed with social anxiety every day i struggle with the fact that i have no friend other than  or  and how i am unable to just talk to people and the fact that when i say this stuff hell just say that im putting in no effort and i cant just blame my diagnosis when i literally cant do anything about it and just force myself to be social it just so hard and just dont know what i did to end up being the one having to apologize and say im sorry and that i never meant to invalidate i just dont get it,anxiety3026,it wa a football watch party and we had to bring

thing is  i am introverted and have a lot of social anxiety the truth is i had to build a lot of courage to even admit it here outloud but im trying to fight and conceal it i told her i am an introvert but i can talk a lot it sort of a reaction to awkward situation because i thought if she said shes a sociophobe  i can be safe and share too nofirst of i had a green wig i am too anxious to actually dye my hair  i dont think i can pick up my kid from school or ride a bus while having green hair but i wanted to look cool and artsy she saw me put on a wig and said but it not your real hair so why are you doing it my confidence and artsy mood sank immediately one client also noticed it a wig and started advising me on hairproducts against alopecia facepalm so i really tried to make it talk to client smile talk to other seller help them i speak  language so i helped them with tourist but the sociophobe kept bragging to other seller that she love selling from her home and uploading to facebook where she ha  friend she doe i checked and i wa like you allow people in your house i would be scared and she go why should i be scared i have a large dogwe both saw a woman in front of u who wa a very charismatic and pushy seller we both cringed and i told the sociophobe wow i guess all we can do is up our product quality so that they sell themselves and she instantly snapped like i make very high quality you speak for yourselfand then a seller and a friend started discussing a wallet with skull and letter and i said hey it an ouija board to speak to the dead and the seller said to her friend oh no you dont need it go return it to the stall and i told myself outloud oh no i just made someone lose their profit how terrible of me and the sociophobe said yeeeeah youre not an introvert and somehow this made me sooo offendedi mean every of these dialogue made me go nut overthinking and regretting and thinking how i should shut up not wear a wig sit differently and how i should smile differently but she sat there confident and cheerfully talked to other seller and client except me and actually found a hitchride home i also needed that ride and i literally went back and forth  time until i actually approached the driver and asked if i can join the ride the exact thing i said wa hi i heard we live in the same town but you dont have to drive me all the way to my house just get me closer in the general direction i dont take up much space and you can put your bag or box on my knee i wont mindand im thinking  is it possible that she just like saying shes a sociophobe because it a novel term that let her turn people down and be snobbish and judgy have you ever seen a person that fake it i mean i feel guilty for thinking it maybe judging me and being snobbish is her coping mechanism but how can a sociophobe have  facebook friend go to every market have client over at her house and hitchhike without a second thought,anxiety3055,im currently

but i can say that i have improved massively throughout the year i avoided every conversation because i wa afraid to fail in the conversation and when i wa in a conversation i felt like i wa always boring when i started practicing this more and applying some technique i learned i started to enjoy these type of conversation whatwhy would you want to get into a conversationpeople want to have good conversation connecting with people that you can have a vibe with is fulfilling and can inspire you and give you energy one conversation can lead to a fulfilling relationship for example someone you would date or a good friend people will think you are more attractive in general if you are interesting and social finally you also want to have fun which is a lot easier when you are smiling and laughing with other people how to be better in conversationgive the other a compliment and spark a conversation by doing a cold read this can be a really effective combination a you make the other person feel good while also making a statement about their life to which they then have the opportunity to respond if someone is making people laugh you can compliment them on their humor and make a statement that you think they are a comedian you do not have to be right it is just a way to get the conversation going and make the other feel good about yoube interested in the other try to get the other person to talk about something they are passionate about instead of the normal closed work and family question you might ask about what excites them in their life or what brought them to make a certain decision instead of asking where somebody is living ask them what made them decide to move to a specific city or area if you ask something that spark the other to talk about something they like they will be much happier to talk about the topic and usually this will lead to a lot of jumping point in the conversation instead of only asking about the others interest you can also make a statement about something that interest you and probably also them and ask the other for their opinion this will give you a new topic to discus and also give them the idea that you value their opinion which will make them associate you with positive feeling you can make an emergency list of topic to discus that you find interesting and that you can fall back on at any time if a conversation start being boring you can also ask people for their advice or their opinion on something they relate to such a what they think of maintaining a good marriage when you are talking to a married person be polarizing have an opinion or value that make people connect with you or have discussion with you if you only fit in people are okay with you but you will not be really interesting stand behind your opinion and value if you feel like you do not want to drink because it is bad for your health and energy throughout the day make people aware of this and do not drink with them because it is socially wanted be strong and people will actually respect you more because you are holding on to your value but be aware that if you are polarizing do not hide behind your opinion or reason be honest that you are not drinking and do not feel bad about it you have a reason for it and others have to respect that and will actually be more interested do not lie because this will only bring problem and distrust toward you also do not take yourself so seriously all the time laugh at yourself if you stumbled somewhere and try to go the other way that people do not expect you to go for example make a statement that you did not remember which leg wa which  call to actionidentifying and applying the conversation technique discussed today have been of great impact on my life i have a lot more fulfilling conversation and feel a lot more comfortable in social situation allow yourself this same feeling by applying the step and live a better lifetldr a lot of people find it difficult to get into a conversation maintain the energy and actually have fun people want to have good conversation connecting with people that you can have a vibe with is fulfilling and can inspire you and give you energy

have developed slight ptsd because of my household situation my dad is a literal narc and a cold hearted cnt who laugh at our situation everyone ha to rely on him financially because you cant really get decent job in this town also my cnt of a father ha spy and many connection in this town so yep no escaping for anyone in this householdmy eldest sibling is added to this and ha worsened my mental health during the year  i cut off from them because of their victim mentality and they are a verbally abusive person and after i ghosted them  completely this sibling threw bitch fit and scapegoated me and blamed me instead note that every each one of u sibling were neglected and abused during our childhood but i fcking despise that sibling in  i even tried convincing them they need to talk to someone but they think they dont have mental illness and belief that everyone around them is crazythey are extremely aggressive towards mom and is delusional think everyone is dirty ha severe ocd tendancies get paranoid and scream like a maniac if anyone touch their clothes even slightly or accidentally and think that everyone in the household conspiring against themthe worst part is that we

sick with either hepatitis and jaundice a a kid amd now ive developed eye fatigueand dizziness etc and am heavily anemic sometimes i think about ending it all but something prevents me from doing it

guy,anxiety3152,removed,anxiety3153,so far starter im a f and the dating scene for me is not great lol im pretty shy so i never talked to guy in h nor wa i very interested in them at the time i definitely am a late bloomer or something tho because the urge to start dating ha hit me like a ton of brick this year for some reason i dont do dating apps because i dont feel comfortable meeting up with guy online since a lot of them dont have the best intention so i think approaching guy in person is my option however the thing is men make me so nervous i cannot talk to them at all like if i see a cute guy in public i will come up with a list of compliment i could potentially say to them but i wont say anything i have this fear that they will judge me or something or think im weird for approaching them out of the blue my mind also go blank and i stutter sometimes when nervous so that would be a nightmare also i dont have any dating experience at all so im pretty embarrassed about that and fear that guy will look at me differently if they know that about me a a guy how you feel if a girl approached you in public what if she hypothetically embarrassed herself and fumbled a pickup line or something,anxiety3154,removed,anxiety3155,we are just hanging out in the school are they ignoring me or should i invite them somewhere i am bad at it jesus idk what to do,anxiety3156,i have a graduation ceremony i have to go to soon and i have to see some people classmate im graduating with for probably the last time in a long while and im wondering how to act without being awkward i spent one year with them classmate in physical proximity during which some stuff happened that affected me personally a guy i talked with online for nearly a year and liked ended up ignoring me and cutting me off from his life then treating me like a stranger our other classmate being good friend with him then me feeling like they all ignored me there were time that they went out without inviting me that really made me feel disliked and abandoned even though i understand why they did that why i did talk individually with them about the guy maybe a bit too much that they felt uncomfortable with me although for me i simply wanted to get support for the emotional turmoil that i didnt know how to manage then i often wondered why the guy who wa so close to me for almost a year during lockdown ended up being a stranger and avoiding contact with me when we were in physical proximity later  for which he avoided to give explanation when asked not wanting to pick up call meet and also his lazy text reply i got the idea of the why he did that much later on when i had meeting with a clinical psychologist and also when he sorta said in group meeting of u telling each other our opinion of one another than i wa fragile and annoying kinda sad to remember he could say these in front of other people but never personally to me i guess i forgot that not everybody can handle me at my worst even though i just wanted friend to support me and help me i learned that i should not have forced for explanation even though that wa truly important for me we ended our program nearly  month ago at this point in life most of them dont really ask me about my life or reply my text and yeah i am learning to move on i wa sad that not just a guy ignored me but more than him others also got uncomfortable being friend with me it wa obvious that they liked being around each other more than me and im learning how to be a better person to feel im good enough before i become dependent on others to make me feel content just that i dont like thinking about how im gonna act during the graduation when ill for sure see them again,anxiety3157,this is one of the biggest problem i have with social anxiety if im in a setting where i feel very socially anxious my anxiety becomes so bad that i cant focus on anything besides how fucking anxious i am someone could be explaining to me how to do something and majority of it just go in one ear and right out the other so i end up coming off a stupid because i dont know what they just saidexplained ive honestly just given up on trying to pay attention in lecture or class that make me socially anxious because i cant retain any of the information that is being taught in the moment if i go home and read it alone or watch a video etc i can comprehend perfectly and understand but it like the second my social anxiety kick in my brain just go numb and i cant think for myself i really hate it so much i have opinion and thing i want to share to people but it like my brain wont fucking work to let me talk and explain it in depth,anxiety3158,removed,anxiety3159,my social anxiety ha made me a really empathetic person and i feel like it both a blessing and a cursei think it made me a really nice person and people seem to feel comfortable around me which make me happy but i know sometimes i end up putting others before myself and alsoi notice that some people without anxiety who are loud extroverted and confident can often be careless selfish and inconsiderate im not blaming them because they probably dont mean to be and i wish i could just not care too i wish i could be confident and not so worried about everyone all the time sometimes i feel like people dont deserve my kindness or that it a weaknessmaybe this is like a grass is greener type of thing and i should learn to be ok with who i am because self love is what i need most but im so sensitive and i wanna just stop thinking so deeply

reserved introvert and there nothing wrong with that i always thought those thing were bad but why would i think who i am is bad so i stopped and now i feel like people appreciate me a lot more

standing there i replied yes it look very nice thank you why in the world did i say thank you it wa one sentence thats all i had to say but i guess i messed that up i prayed they didnt hear it luckily the  boy had started a conversation of their own but the other girl heard me and took no hesitation in telling the other girl they looked me up and down and burst out laughing they had no caution to supress their laughter for the sake of me instead they laughed at me like i wasnt there but i wa and my face went bright red i wanted to cry god i hate those bitch i made one simple mistake and they think i deserved my entire day to be a nightmare i hate that kind of people the kind that pretend that they dont make slipups like what i did and ignore the pain that come with it and reject all form of sympathy instead they use my own sadness for their own personal ego gain it disgusting anyway i turned my back and walked away back into my lonely life a i walk away i hear the girl tell they boy

yesterday i went on social medium for once in a very long time and saw it wa an old acquaintance birthday i shouldve commented hbd but for some reason even that simple task wa anxiety inducing having to be on social medium again with a public comment and i wondered if that person even remembered me or liked me in the first place sa is just so self centered and thats why i dont like it and a much a

like that and i especially struggle with online phone text thing i just cant bring myself to do even though so much is so low risk im so annoyed at myself but oh well maybe thing will get better just

sound more like what someone would do in an xrated chat roulettebut it worked  rather than thinking of loneliness a something i had to escape or be ashamed by i treated it a it own feeling to be experienced it a feeling just like any other i looked at how it made me feel  i gave myself space to decide if i wa being entirely fair to myself in how loneliness colored my perception of myself trying to be nonjudgmental about thateventually it almost felt like i wa sitting there with another person at which point loneliness itself felt  bizarre  certainly the judgment started to feel bizarre and a little bit incorrectanyway it worked for me  thought id share in case anyone wa looking for something to try,anxiety3264,removed,anxiety3265,thought amp prayer please seriously im

so many friend is because i have a great fear of being judged by others in a negative way what people think about me seriously cut deep and that doesnt help because my self esteem is extremely low i tend to see my hand violently shaking after being the centre of attention in a room with people i know arent my friend and would judge me another grand fear i have is the fear of being a disappointment but thats another topic am i being too much when i say i have social anxiety  my friend still cant believe me when i said i hate talking to people so it make me feel like im over

totally new to the industry  literally like  hour of training from a supervisor who showed up on my third shift so the first two shift i wa totally on my own he actually a really standup guy and i love him  he not the management thats trash in this storyanyway ive received great review from the client themselves  they like how i operate and ive even done stuff that beginner arent really expected to pull off so soon the social anxiety prevents me from being likecharming in the social sense but my professionalism and attentiveness to the job ha earned people respect on the site i work atmanagement of my company however who operate from an office hundred of kilometer away are angry that im not making report like they want exactlyeven though i wasnt trained at all for doing so and received conflicting guidance about how to make the report nevermind the achievement ive accomplished which received zero acknowledgement from the management nevermind the approval of the client themselvesapparently not being trained to make report like they want is reason enough for the management to talk down to me like i fucked everything up even though their incompetence at training a total newcomer to the industry is in no small part why im not fulfilling their specific criterianow im just going to stop trying so hard deliberately going to fulfil the report in the most robotic manner and im going to stop putting in effort that are ignored many people on the site have flirted with me daily and ive felt the need to keep it professional and not fraternize too much because it feltwell unprofessional  but now im just gonna shoot the shit every daythe funny part about anxiety is that it get overridden by angry disappointment they want to fuck around with one of their best

the redness my face get when i get shy and im insecure so it just help overall found it though,anxiety3297,background i am f i guess i could have always been described a quiet and introverted but it got so much worse after the lockdown in the pandemic to the point where any interaction with someone new stress me out to the maximum i did my last  year of college online and i got a job in software development after finishing so this job allows me to work from home which is heaven for someone like me the only problem being i am increasingly mortified to speak to my colleague most of my colleague have been there for  year and are also older and more experienced so i am intimidated by them and im so afraid of messing up that make me shut down and not contribute to any group conversation unless asked there many thing i would want to say sometimes and i feel like i do have a lot in common with them but something just hold me back we have a  minute online meeting everyday where they do have small talk which i usually dont participate in which only make me more self consciousat the end of every month we have get togethers at the office which are meant for socializing i have been working here for a whole year and only participated in two of those reason being i have no one to go with i only know the few people i work with on the project the rest of the people are total stranger to me since i dont work at the office both time i did try my best and stuck around the people ive known and i did conversate with them however they would sometimes just leave and i would just sit there alone in a corner staring at everyone i feel so isolated next month i am switching project which mean i will be introduced to new colleague who i am going to be working with from then on  i dont want to feel this way anymore but i also cant imagine a way to be myself in a work setting people often judge or just dont want to be your friend if you refuse to engage with them and i dont want that happening once again needle to say social skill take you place technical skill wont sometimes i dont want my lack of them to hold me back from being credited for my performance success story anyone,anxiety3298,guy from my class messaged me and said that he would like to get to know me and if id like to go get a coffee with him i wa super suprised because weve never talked and tbh im not

starter or maybe what i can bring up to talk about thanks in advance and i hope we all one day manage to handle our social anxiety it a very untalked irony about mental illness and the prejudice

without revealing phone number and at least somewhat secure and i think telegram app would be ok for that you need to register with phone number but you can hide it after and so create anonymous account to refer english is not my native language but it quite gooddoes anyone would like to be a part of the group it would basically be like this sub to just vent describe your day if you barely

fast but it always come with a drawbackas usual once i stepped out of my comfort zone my hand started trembling like hell i even made clumsy body language mistake but all that wa thankfully overlooked by the people i wa talking to because they were fixated on their screen i wa helping them with their computer work honestly it felt uplifting to offer my aid after i received some complimentswow op is like a professordamn bro you know the i dont remember what anime youre like that genius of the classsuffice to say i wa much more confident in my intelligence than i ever wa until i started to acknowledge the headache i wa getting lol i had to teach about  different people whilst also worrying about social anxiety so it make sense that my brain would start malfunctioning and go into overdrive especially if i wa also looking at different type of coding style some of which were super messy honestlynot long after i hit my limit and just told them if you still cant by tomorrow just approach me i really cant help right now im having a headachebest thing wa i made them all laugh and they were like thanks thanks it mightve been a headacheinducing exposure activity but im glad i could help people whilst also building up social skill,anxiety3316, hi im ashamed to post this im  and i overthink too much and it reached a horrifying and ridiculous extent to now i dont know what to do when im not having eye contact with people i see that there are such condition a eye contact anxiety but in my case i dont have any problem with eye contact instead i dont know where to place my eye when im not giving eyecontact with someone before i even became so aware of this regardless of my social anxiety i wouldnt care about where i placed my eye i would have probably just stared off into the corner of the room and space out think of random thing and be a normally functioning person but now i cant let my mind set free i am aware of everything i look at and i cant stop overthinking i cant even do this with teacher im scared they might think im creepy for giving too much or too little eye contact or for how unatural my behaviour are because im so stiff rigid and awkward i control everything i do like a robot because i think of all these comands before doing it every single thing i do i have to consciously talk it through my head and when i do it come off a odd unatural and it very obvious that im trying to hide something it show that im insecure or people just know that im scared of people critiszing me and it absolutely pathetic also this is really important im scared of being a perv i have a reason for this i honestly know im not one and im a good person and nothing bad ha ever happened to me but im literally digging my own grave the more i try really hard to not to become the person i dont want to be the more i am beginning to become like it im too embarrassed to talk to a psychologist about this i feel so messed up im only  also to add on to this i have no friend because of my social anxiety and i want to fix this so bad what do i do should i muster up the courage to talk to my psychologist about this it so mentally draining please help me,anxiety3317,the reason im writing this is because i noticed that i started shivering when i started to message one of my friend they messaged me first and a i replied i immediately started to shiver even though i wasnt even cold and the conversation wa friendly and stuff i wa shivering so much my muscle started to ache and after i stopped for a second to take some deep breathes the shaking stopped after a minute i often shake like this when messaging people that arent my family or best friend and when i shake like this i also find im thinking thing like am i being annoying am i being funny enough etc but i never shake like this in person i also cry super easily usually from social situation like the doctor which is the worst all the attention is on me for example a few day ago i went to the doctor for ear pain and they were asking simple question like is it a sharp pain when did the pain start and i immediately started to tear up and it wa so embarrassing cause my mom wa just looking at me and the doctor wa probably so confused a to why i wa on the verge of cry from that then the doctor looked in my ear and i mean it hurt but not bad enough to make me cry but i cried anyway cause i wa already nervous   whenever teacher talk to me head on call on me etc i immediately start tearing up im not even thinking any noticeably anxious thought either which is confusing i never raise my hand of volunteer for anything that would bring attention to me either i also have a big fear of looking stupid in front of others my grade have gotten worse because of it one of my assignment is about being given a picture and writing a story about it and guess what im not doing it because im afraid my teacherclassmates will find the idea stupidi actually discared all of my idea cause they actually suck so i dont even have an idea yet so all class long i just pretend im doing the work to avoid my teacher coming over to help me because i will tear up  because i dont want to write in front of her cause im worried it dumb this happens a lot in many of my class one of my class we can build cool stuff but im worried others will look at my project and find it dumb the only way i get work done is by working with other people and they come up with all the idea while i do whatever they tell me to last year i had no friend in my class so i did no work but now i have friend in the class so im actually getting stuff done everyone call me shy because i can never do stuff like go up to cashier and order thing and ive never had a ton of friend ive always preferred  or  best friend and then a few people i kind know however last year i made a very extroverted friend who introduced me to her many many friend so this year i had a head start and already knew a lot of peoplealso i would like to mention that most of the time people come up to me first,anxiety3318,i wish i could meet people like me in my school who have social anxiety and have trouble making friend

me,anxiety3319,i finally reached out to my university mental health service but theyve been so backlogged that i had to wait a very long time to have a quick phone call appointment with someone to discus the problem i am having it only a minute phone call but i hate phone call and ive never opened up about my problem to anyone irl normally i would just cancel an appointment like this but this time im not because i know i need to reach out and i need therapy i know eventually im going to have to stop avoiding everything i have no one in my life i am the only one to hold myself accountable,anxiety3320,i work in a warehouse preparing order to be packaged and shipped to customer through the mailthe packing itself is a little repetitive but i can listen to music and have my

people but nothing lasted very long i want to try again im f canadianest im in university i like math and video game over time chatting with you guy ive realized that we all have different type of sa

suck,anxiety3322,i f am someone who is extremely shy timid and a bit awkward so i relate to a lot of these post often i find it difficult to socialize with extrovert and those that are outgoing because i cant match their energy i feel drained when interacting with someone who ha high energy and talkative not their fault i have been thinking lately of a way to put myself out there and find a way to meet with other people who have sa i think it would be good for u a we all struggle with something very similar and will be nonjudgmental of each other this will be a way for u to get out of our shell a well and practice putting ourselves out there ive also read a lot of post of some of u feeling lonely i think this will be an amazing way to feel like a part of something and not feel so alone all the time this will be a safe space for u to be ourselves with no expectation just be yourself i love the idea of eventually turning it into inperson gettogethers to do thing like hiking lowkey house gettogethers or game night i will update this post if anyone is interested including my email and arrange a meeting i feel that no one will understand me better than those who experience the same thing a me i also think we can help each other get out of this struggle somehow and if somehow is in a dark place i hope we can somehow help each other get out of it there is nothing wrong with u i believe we just havent found our niche one love lt,anxiety3323,so i just moved to a new town where i dont know anyone amp there is a really cute boy that work at the grocery store by me i

the reluctance that most people feel regarding age such a when big age milestone are hit it more than that i try to avoid answering where possible which a you might imagine is itself very awkward it conflicting because i dont want to mislead or be seen a untrustworthy but i often cant bring myself to sayfor me this problem run deeper so i wish people would just back off i realise it quite a glaring character weakness if someone is unable to answer something a basic a their age yet it make me feel so vulnerableim not immature but i give off a childlike curiosity and playfulness to those around me i feel i dont want to behave in the same way those of my age would behave but this is frowned or or at least viewed with suspicion by society im quite a clumsy and awkward person and in truth i dont have any true friendsit doesnt help that my body ha not developed enough to look my age and so i live my life playing the part of someone much younger i am physically quite youthfulat work i continually hope coworkers wont ask much about my life lest it reveal my age i worry any friendship or bond that i have formed up to that point might break perhaps paradoxically i do think some look to me a a kind of mentor or a confidanti also think part of my reluctance to reveal my age is the fact i have not achieved certain milestone in my life  i am not married or in a relationship i dont have child i dont own a house even the notion of any of those thing being true fill me with frighti can think of countless example from my earlier life were people have assumed i wa younger than i wa or looked in disbelief when they found out my true age when i wa  while sat in the emergency exit row on a flight flight attendant wa shocked that i wa over  and therefore permitted to sit there when i wa  and booking ferry ticket the assistant called over a colleague and shared a glance while checking at my passportthis affliction ha followed me throughout my life sometimes i think maybe none of this thinking is real and that maybe i do look older than i perceive yet i remember all the lifelong occasion of surprise when people learnt the truthin an attempt to interrupt the conditioned tendency of my anxious mind i just remember that there is going to come a day at the end of my life when i would give anything just to be able to be back here right now,anxiety3341,not sure if it

my mother on a walk in the evening on the main square at the city and i lt triggered a major anxiety attack i hate myself for not being able to do basic thing i cried for a good hour before calming

thought everything would be fine because when i decided to live with these girl i wa good friend with  of them and kind of friend with the other  but since living together i have drifted so far apart from my  friend and all  of them are now really good friend i have diagnosed social anxiety and im an introvert so it so hard for me to live in a house where i constantly have to be socializing at least in high school when i lived at home i would go to school and socialize there but then id have a safe space to go home to and unwinddestressfinally relax but now my only safe space is my bedroom literally going anywhere in my house whether that be the bathroom to brush my teeth or the kitchen to make dinner mean i have to interact with someone it so bad to the point where i just wont eat or use the washroom because im so anxious about interacting with my house matesand what make it even worse is the fact that theyre all good friend and hang out and never include me i know this may be because of my social anxiety and they probably think im unfriendlydont like them but i cant help but think that they all think im weird and dont like me which make me even more anxious about interacting with them i really tried to make an effort with them at the beginning of the semester when we moved in but aside from my social anxiety my social battery just run out so quickly theyre all extrovert and always are hanging out around the house doing stuff together like watching tv or making dinner but i just dont have the social battery to keep up with all this socializing maybe  or  day a week i would hang out with them but eventually they just stopped asking me to do stuff with them which obviously i took a a sign they dont like me i dont know what to do i feel like im so in deep now there no way of fixing it sometimes i want to ask them if they wanna smoke or watch a show or go study together but then i just think if they wanted to do that with me they would ask i also dont know what the protocol is when you live with friend like if theyre watching tv in the living room do i just sit and join them is that the friendly thing to do like i said i just always think that if they wanted to include me in whatever they are doing then they would ask tldr my social anxiety make me think my roommate hate me and this make it hard for me to live in a house with them,anxiety3346,removed,anxiety3347,ive not long come from an evening withfamily friend and my wife remark that i hardly said anything or got involved with conversation and just sat on my phone honestly i couldnt think of a single thing to contribute whenever i did talk it wa either ignored unheard or nobody laughed at a joke i tried to make or take a remark i said to let me get involved in conversation a room of about  people including me and feeling completely invisible everyone asking question of each other even when others arent talking not me though like i show interest but they dont show it backdoes there come a time where you should just cut your loses and bow out just accept you might be too boring and weird for social situation to be accepted i thought i wa getting better with just rolling with the punch and trying again after i did some learning to improve my social skill but tonight just set me right back,anxiety3348,how ha it helped you or not just wanna hear

alone i do it just like everyone else and even if i am myself they get bored i feel their gaze sometimes i do not even talk because i know i will fail,anxiety3353,so ive only been recently diagnosed a being on the spectrum and started questioning a lot of social norm lately that i used to take for granted i suffer from social anxiety i am relatively quietshy a little awkward and a bit of a loner anyway now that i have given a bit of background context to the type of person i am i pose my question why are neurotypical people so loud in public place and in group setting how do these people always seem to only ever talk about surface level stuff for example work gossip mundane thing they have been doing recently random story about their friend and general small talkpleasantries i spend a lot of time alone working from coffee shop and restaurant and cant help but eavesdrop on other people conversation i generally dont spend a lot of time socialising or even being around other people but when i do i seem to only thrive when conversation are revolved around deeper topic such a psychology philosophy culture art music etc i find i really struggle to involve myself in regularcommon conversation because i just have nothing to add my mind is blank  i will ask question but that usually only ever get me so far i generally have nothing to contribute people seem to form friendship so easily while i am left behind doe anyone else really struggle in this way or have answer a to why most people seem to be content with mundane surface level conversation i find it so hard to make friend because of this i am so quiet in group setting and usually just try to leave  but im really trying to put myself out thereim almost  and id love to just figure this all out thanks for reading,anxiety3354,pretty sure my social anxiety stem for childhood trauma a a child and being bullied i often would wear jacket in  degree fahrenheit weather because i didnt feel comfortable in my own body i would either try too hard to be liked or reject others before they could reject me all my relationship have been online i havent had a local friend since  due to reason that caused me to become truly paranoid for a while declined invitation from local who were mutuals with ex friend of mine cause i believed it wa a trap to get me alone and cause me harm ive hidden from myself and from others for so long dont get me wrong though ive done really well in recent year since addressing bpd sticking to therapy and finding spirituality but all of it hurt because my last therapy session really set me off in a way i didnt think it would i also wa recently diagnosed with adhd and at the moment i dont have a consistent support system i know the key to it all is rescuing myself and loving myself but i just hurt a lot with all the issue i have and everything that is coming up i have come out of my comfort zone in way i didnt think i ever would but it doesnt feel like it enough which make me feel worse about myself i hurt very deeply at the moment my heart is broken,anxiety3355,i wa going to university to work on a project thats due next week i went to the coffe machine to get a coffee and then went down a corridor with table on one side to sit on one of those a i sat down and started to work on it i realised that right in front of me wa a group of people i had talked to several time at university party and that i had passed them without saying hello i didnt know what to do they where talking very loudly in their native language i knew i should greet them but i didnt do it instantly and they apparently where in the middle of a heated conversation so i did nothing i tried to act a if i didnt see them but it got harder and harder i tried controlling my eye to not look into that direction and generally not look around so that it didnt seem like i wa ignoring them but like i wa just very concentrated on my project i thought i heard my name  time in their conversation so i wa imagining them saying something like whats going on with him he didnt even greet u how rude meanwhile i couldnt actually concentrate on my project the anxiety wa destroying my ability to think clearly i just started at my screen putting all my energy into not making any move and even tho in that time i actually kinda decided to just go over and greet them saying i didnt see them at first i couldnt do it anymore the stress wa destroying my ability to speak or do anything i wa just frozen  theyve been gone for probably  minute now and im still sitting here completely stressed a bit le than before of course but still and also completely  exhausted from it unable to calm down im so ashamed of myself of how i must seem to others fuck man and all of that despite me

me so i can overcome negative thought and be more confidentim  year old and i feel very pressured to conquer thing that havent happened in my life until today but socially im terrible i also believe that ive pushed many people away perhaps passing on an image of disinterest but that in reality it wa totally insecure shyness and fear of being judged negativelyat the same time that i doubt my ability appearance and quality i feel that i am living a lie i feel that i can do anything if i overcome these obstaclesampxbthank you very much for all your consideration,anxiety3358,not looking for praise or anything just felt the desire to share some progress i made this week the last three year have been unbelievably damaging for me with lockdown making it so easy to retreat and hide away

ticket last minute to a music festival where i knew nobody else going walked away feeling really positive and connected to the worlddespite needing a fair bit of alcohol to enjoy the music i think this is the first time in a long time ive actually let myself enjoy something in public interestingly enough i still feel this sense of sadness in the back of my mind but i think that could just be exhaustion from how hard it been and maybe relief that im starting to see the light at the end of the sa tunnel just gotta keep that momentum going and keep pushing through the fear gently of course

of people say to attract woman is working out fixing yo face and having good game but if u want woman to really know you you got to be posting on social medium it really mandatory guy and ik some of you guy dont like it but it the truth once your body is good your face is clean now it time to start putting your face up so many more people can know you snapchat insta maybe tiktok edits if ur good at making those you have to make yourself look like a extrovert that way not only woman think your cool and live a life but other men a well and will want to hang out with you and then sooner or later woman might ask to hang out with you and this could be a higher chance of getting laid especially if ur in highschool or college you have many chance for people to know who you are yeah sure socializing and approaching are cool but lot of people use social medium these day you have to put yourself out there now you dont need to post daily but at least post on snap  time a week insta maybe  time a month if your going out or going to a event ik it hard and some of yall introvert but this is one of the best way to attract so work on your body and face and when you get confident start taking pic and i promise you will feel confident and you will get attention if you work on urself hope this help let me know if i miss anything,anxiety3375, this video changed my view on loneliness and made me appreciate how i felt about my situation sharing this here for other people to benefit from  httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvdxsaeviruhttpswwwyoutubecomwatchvdxsaeviru,anxiety3376,yesterday i went to my music class it wa the only class that i had that day and i wa really anxious because i had to meet up with a few of my classmate to practice a song that we are going to perform the next week i barely talk to them because my face get really red and it embarrass me even more so when i arrive to school i tried to hide from them while we waited for the teacher to come but time passed and the teacher didnt arrive so i went to the bathroom and saw the teacher next to the outdoor stage talking to other teacher thats when i remembered that there wa a music contest and the teacher probably wouldnt attend to the practice and we would have to practice on our own  i dont why i started to feel so anxious to come back to the classroom and face my classmate to tell them that so my brain decided to run away from school and come back home i feel like a coward because i couldnt do something so simple like talking to my classmate and the worst part is that the upcoming week we have to perform and i didnt practice with them enough so i probably wont know what to do at stage this social anxiety is running my life,anxiety3377,before comment begin berating my presence here im aware that being on reddit and even the internet at my age isnt ideal however i dont browse the internet for anything but selfimprovement advice all im looking for here is a confirmation that i may have sa ive got a therapist appointment scheduled a week from now but i dont want to waste the therapist time if im just exaggerating or falsely self deprecating if that make sense some backgroundwhen youre surrounded by individual with similar view on a subject it only natural that youre inclined to be convinced by their opinion an opposing word would be drowned by louder more normal voice and you wouldnt have access to contrasting opinion or perhaps you wouldnt even question the authenticity of your view if so many supported it being in elementary school at the time i wa even more vulnerable to the impact of the content i consumed it wasnt until  that i realized the harm it did to me and the influence it had on my attitude towards socializing with classmate or anyone of the same gender a me really it why i picked up the whole im not like the other girl thing i wanted to believe that i wa special compared to the bratty fake plastic girl portrayed in the thing i watched and read lowquality fan fiction gacha life video selfabsorbed youtubers etc and thats what my parent told me a well  that i wa well beyond my year and i wanted to be treated a such i remember cry when i wa eight year old because my parent wouldnt allow me to sit at the table when they were discussing financial issue since they saw me a a child and i wa of course but again i just didnt want to seem that way so when i thought that my personality wa too shallow or immature i began picking up mental illness like they were trait of some sort that i could just gather and add to my avatarive grown out of that phase of course but it gotten me really selfconscious about whether the thing i feel are truly genuine or not what if im just faking it what if i just need something to hide to add to my personality because that is what i do sometimes  researching the general consensus of an artist music not only so i can make sure their music is of a highquality but so that the thing i like are seen a good from another person perspective and so i can use argument that other people form about that artist music because i can never form my own opinion about anything it feel like i have no personality at all sometimes cause im constantly worried about expressing myself to add to this a few year ago i enrolled in an online school where live class werent required and contact with teacher could be overlooked all quiz lesson assignment etc were to be taken and completed online thus i didnt know any of my peer and eventually got accustomed to a life where i received little social contact with anyone but my family simple task such a picking up takeout from the doorstep would feel exhilarated and exhaustingfor example the the other day i wa ordering pizza and have to leave a special request to not put any mushroom on the pizza so i just said please dont add any mushroom on the pizza thanks but then i thought is thanking them in the message really necessary i can just thank the delivery guy when he come by but maybe ill thank the chef and the delivery person individually but what if adding please and thank you would make the message too long perhaps theyd just skip reading it so i should just remove thanks amp please and do i really need to be saying please and thank you if im paying them then again maybe they wont listen to my request if i dont use please and thank you so ill just order at a time thats not now since theyll probably be rushing and may not listen to my request then i can send the order and the message out i can afford to go hungry for a few more hour but waitdo i really need to be telling them not to put mushroom on the pizza im not a toddler  i can just remove them by myself or stomach them if neededetc and i remember wanting to order japanese food at a mall a few year ago but i couldnt get there without being afraid of what the person at the counter would think of a nonjapanese child wanting to get such food ugh this is why i hate venting it always feel like im just exaggerating thing or only venting for confirmation of the thing i dont believe trying to make myself seem pitiful enough that everyone say i do experience  it feel like even the insult i say to myself arent genuine it feel like nothing here is genuine  but even saying that is a plea for attention isnt it gosh darn it i just dont know anymore ive been contemplating posting this for week now out of fear of what you guysll say but i dont care anymore even if i dont have sa whats wrong with me,anxiety3378,when my bf broke up with me i developed anxiety i wa literally afraid of going outside going to the store wa a big no for me but it gotten better i go to the store and i meet new people and stuff it uncomfortable but it ok i guess but i wanna be able to meet my friend but i am afraid of taking the bus i dont know why the bus used to be the best part of the day i could listen to music and just look at the road and chill ive come so far but im stuck at this bus thing because if i get anxious i cant escape before the bus stop that stress me out i really want my old life back,anxiety3379,a little background  so basically i have failed my class and repeating again this year while going to home a batchmate of mine stopped me and told that i walk like i have a pain in right leg and from then it ha been causing me so much anxiety that yesterday i couldnt walk on road  and i felt like i dont remember how to walk properly i cannot seektherapy now for financial reason  i also identified my reason for not being able to walk properly wa my sleeper

online im not from the psychologist and psychiatrist i spoke to we ruled autism and aspergerswhat make social anxiety so close to autism in my opinion is that we both struggle in social situation the average person may recognize this and label u a weird or different but to my understanding an autistic person doesnt always understand social cue and lack self awareness i on the hand am too self aware which is what heightens my social anxiety i understand social cue but dont know how to go about them especially in group face to face conversation and entering an already existing conversation my lack of social interaction growing up in a lonely isolated environment from middle school through high school ha defined my adulthood i wa always quiet and shy a a kid but the lack of experience turned my shyness into social anxiety i understand people but i dont understand how to fit in with people because im so focused on not coming across awkward unintentionally rude or weird which make me even more awkward i also feel like im constantly trying to change myself to please others like a robot that is striving to be perfect if someone complains about me i do everything i can to avoid doing that thing ever again im constantly adjusting how i am around people so everyone can be pleased with me i talk too fast ill talk super slow now i walk too fast ill walk super slow i can tell youre annoyed by me talking to you from now on ill pretend you dont even exist ill walk past you without making eye contact my mind is constantly going a mile a minute analyzing how each person want me to act around them so they dont criticize me it exhausting,anxiety3386,my anxiety ha progressively gotten worse throughout the year ive been in therapy for year ive tried medication and grounding technique yet i feel a if im getting nowhere i have brief period when my anxiety is like a tag in a shirt thats always itchy and i welcome those day with open arm most day it like someone is holding a plastic bag over my head and sitting on my chest i cant work because of it it make it damn near impossible to go to store especially grocery store i have no friend anymore and since im out of school i

few thing and at one point i almost passed out because i wa trying to not have a full blown panic attack in the store i could barely keep my breath steady so i wa shaking my vision kept going in and out of being blurry my leg were getting weak and buckling in it didnt help that i saw a few people staring at me which made it worse by the time i got to the register it wa at a point i had to get out the cashier wa super sweet but i could tell she knew what wa happening with me she didnt do anything wrong but standing in front of someone who know youre having a panic attack escalated it for me thankfully i wa with my dad so he finished the check out he hasnt seen how i get inside store since i wa a kid  and he finally seeing how much my anxiety affect me he try his best to be supportive but he doesnt know how to help someone who extremely anxious let alone his only daughter i think about how im supposed to start community college soon and just the thought of it make my stomach turn i dont know what to do anymore i live in internal isolation while surrounded by people who already have stable social life i dont know how im going to do school if i cant even go to the fucking store to get a few thing without feeling like im going to die when i wa  i wa certain that i wouldnt live until  yet here i am a  year old disaster who wish that i ended it when i wa still a kid i know that im

go and they were a bit better than the first two i spoke to i said to myself before i went to the event that i would go out and stay for  minute and leave after that whenever i wanted i think i ended up staying near an hour  so i at least pushed myself out of my comfort zone and ill take pride in that i think my anxiety may be noticeable to others i will need to get more comfortable  one thing that would help is if i had some idea for conversation starter so would be le worried about the conversation hitting the wall,anxiety3391,for the past few year i have become a complete recluse with

i had told one of my classmate about this and they laughed at me and constantly ridicule me for skipping a semester and ruining my education over what he considered a minor inconvenience it just made me feel worthless i suppose adding a semester to my degree because of anxiety and depression i dont think i regret it but it doe make me wish i hadnt told anyone about it,anxiety3394,so i know it

life can be hard but this is just complete torture well ive accepted it this is my life i am a complete contradiction and i survive like i can i just want to break the cycle thats why im speaking with

them over time and they have opened up to me but i am not feeling that connection very often my anxiety is so bad that it can be crippling around any person no matter who it is it like im constantly in fight or flight mode i cant enjoy the moment with them most of the time i cannot open up talk about my interest or even simply joke around i just sit there quietly in fight or flight wondering when i can leave even though i want so badly to stay and connect and be myself what do i do i feel like giving up im so tired,anxiety3398,i am a senior in highschool i have a few very close friend i have opened up to them about my mental health trauma and each of them have opened up to me but i cannot enjoy these moment i have with them because of stupid anxiety my social anxiety is paralyzing even around them so i mostly just stay quiet and let them do the talking they notice this and they try to get me to open up more often or simply just talk about my interest or anything really but it is so hard for me i cannot even simply joke around most of the time my anxiety is killing me i hardly feel that connection after we hang out because i cannot enjoy the moment it like im always in fight or flight mode ha anyone else experienced this how do i live in the moment more often and be myself dispite my anxiety,anxiety3399,by phone i mean calling not textingthis is interesting because i hear people complain about talking on the phone all the time but i find it wayyy easier to talk on the phone anyone in the same boat talking on the phone is le stressful than talking in real life for meview pollhttpswwwredditcompollzjdqs,anxiety3400,i am f i have been chatting with this guy that i met via old for the past few day even though it only been two day my anxiety ha already kicked in he seems to have a lot of good quality but im already starting to realize how different we are my social anxiety ha improved substantially over the year but i am still a big introvert and awkward at time due to that the pandemic a devastating health diagnosis that sent me into a deep depression and only having two friend ive missed out on a lot between my prime year i also have only had one serious relationship rarely go out because my friend dont live near me and i have never really had the opportunity to travel because i live paycheck to paycheck this guy on the other hand is an extrovert he only a few year older than me but he is far ahead of me in life we exchanged social medium and he ha a ton of friend well travelled and obviously make way more money than i do im now feeling insecure and wanting to discontinue talking to him because i feel inferior he hasnt said anything to make me feel any way but it just triggered me and now i feel down i am venting for the most part but any advice is appreciated,anxiety3401,tonight i realized a pattern that ha been common with me i am shy and introverted i suffer from social anxiety and most of the time when a group of people is talking together i stay on my own because i am scareddont know how to join the grouptoday i wa at an event and most of the day i wa on my own struggling to even talk to someone or when i did it wa a very brief exchange and that made me feel quite depressed throughout the dayand then tonight i talked to a girl and she wa nice and she wa the only person today to ask something about me and that led u to have a conversation and more people joined and i wa even leading the conversation at time i wa witty funny etc i felt intetesting and that made me realize that im actually not that introverted i can have a conversation and be talkative even with people i dont know it just that i guess i dont vibe with a lot of people,anxiety3402,i have ocd but recently i realised that most of my intrusive thought are present when i am in social situation it feel a if ocd wasnt the root problem but the social anxiety  and ocd is just sitting at the top of the social anxiety  but i dont have the typical social anxiety symptom so i am not sure if this can be considered itwhen i go out i think i would be okay talking to stranger i even sometimes do but talking to my friend seems so tiring and distressing whenever i get an invite to do something with my friend i cancel and have been doing this now for  and a half month  i mostly stay at my place i always think to myself   what id they will notice that i changed since developing ocd what if i get a panic attack and wont be able to hide it what if it will be too bad and i wont be able to calm myself down i think i have a bigger issue with showing up to friend because i consider them people that might judge me because i see them regularly but when i talk to stranger my head say well who care for their opinion  i will never see them again doe anyone know what might help me,anxiety3403,in high school i would always be like  hr late bc i got so anxious before school in college i started skipping my class if i dont feel ready enough it hard for me to go anywhere it stupid but if my makeup doesnt look good it hard for me to go because im scared that if i dont look good people will think im weird and off putting and if im in a really anxious quiet mood im probably not going either i feel like i need  hour to mentally prepare myself for something nothing can motivate me to go anywhere because my anxiety is so strong ive wasted money by skipping the dentist and doctor appointment and college at this point i just dont make appointment because i dont think ill be able to attend them but now i have no life and am neglecting my healthseeing friend is a little easier because i know them and i know they wont judge me a hard im very scared of people who seem very normal or like they have their life together because i feel like they have expectation of people that i wont be able to meet  im very awkward and dont know how to hold a conversation i cant think straight at all when meeting new people it just all anxiety sometimes i completely lose my ability to speak everyone think im weird even my friend they just dont mind it idk what to do it been  year since i failed college and my avoidance of thing ha only gotten worse i want to have a life i just dont even understand how people can do it,anxiety3404,guy the title already is making cringe i am an extremely forgetful person so i often set myself alarm to remind myself to get really important thing done throughout the day well last night it backfired on me because i set an alarm to remind myself i needed to turn in paperwork for my job at  pm but my dumb forgetful self forgot that i wa going to watch a  hour movie at  pm and completely forgot about the alarm even existed forgetceptioni usually do a great job of turning off my ringer and iphone volume before the movie start and havent had an issue in all of my year of theater movie watching but last night wa the big exceptionright in the middle of watching the movie my alarm go off worst part is it didnt just go off once but twice because i couldnt find the darn phone in the dark due to it being buried in my jacket i turned it off a quick a i could but the damage wa already done i just sat there in the dark bright a a tomato and started sweating horribly i couldnt even properly focus on the movie afterwards because i wa so embarrassed i take movie watching very seriously and hate when this kinda stuff happens but i usually let it slide a bit because mistake happen and were in a public watching space but when it happens to you it sucksmy family afterwards softly teased me about it oh so you where the one responsible for the alarm here i wa thinking it wa some rando who didnt listen to the whole turn off your phone before the movie hahahai know it shouldnt be a big deal but the cringe of the situation make me want to  crawl into a hole and stay there forevertldr forgetton alarm went off i want to shrivel up in cringe,anxiety3405,a the title say i started it recently didnt like how i felt the first time taking it a a full pill had a bad body high so i split them a of now i couldnt tell if they were doing anything since then and i only take them a needed felt fine before going to the grocery store so i said fuck it and went out i felt like i wa in everyones way and that everyone wa angry at me the entire time i wa stressed when i had to backtrack for an item and almost decided against getting it since i wa taking up too much space and should have left by then im outside waiting on my bus now regretting not taking my med like an idiot so ya just felt like whining about it  take your med friend,anxiety3406, that wa the last time i had friend local to me and since then it all been online which i dont mind but given almost all my important relationship are virtual i feel like ive been living in a small prison of my own creation because i dont feel like i can be seen i used to not like myself so much and hide that id crop out my forehead in photo cause i hated my eyebrow i went by another name different to my own birth given name i really lost myself in my teen year i gained a lot of weight due to heartbreak and depression i started wearing baggy clothing to hide myself and my body i became invisible in order to prevent being bullied childhood trauma from it all or make myself stick out yesterday in therapy we had this discussion and now im left wondering how do i overcome this ive come out of my comfort zone a lot but it doesnt feel like enough i feel trapped scared and like i cant do it she gave me the goal of making one local friend by june just a loose deadline not even a true deadline but an incentive to keep getting myself out there but im not sure how given ive always sucked at social skill or i tried too hard or not at all then again i know this is me just making excuse im just really scared i know my belief stated in the title is unrealistic and nobody is perfect but i guess perfection  protection from rejection or any pain in life which again i know is unrealistic,anxiety3407,im f still not sure if i have social anxietyall i know is im not normal im shy i thought but i remember hearing somewhere that shy people are shy at first but get comfortable around someone after a period of time i mean ive been working at my job for eight month and i still have trouble and experience nervousness around my coworkers none of them know who i truly am not even a fraction they know my a the shy timid girl that doesnt talk much thats literally how i am introduced to new people who come aboard and i hate it my sister have job and claim that eveyone love them im thinking my coworkers must hate me cause in so boring to work with since i dont talk that much thats how i feel just a waste of space in my team who doesnt contribute much im actually thinking of quitting so i could start over starting over would be easier cause no one then will know me a the shy girl changing personality always freak me out cause changing brings attention if im shy then suddenly start talking then eveyone will look at me weird it brings attention and i dont want to experience that so i want quit my job that i love because i hate being known a the shy girl ive been working there for  month and im still nervousthere ha to be something wrong so do i have social anxiety i ask i mean there more reason why i believe this then just work back when i wa at school classmate joked that i wa mute it wa so bad back then that people actually joked about that since then ive worked on myself but i still have trouble i worry too much about joking around cause i worry about offending others i worry that my joke may not come out right and not be funny which would be embarrassing i worry about asking question about other people life cause i may offend them somehow or come off a inappropriate for asking too many personal question i worry about looking stupid and being perceived a dumb i worry about coming off a boring or weird i worry so much that i my mind go blank here an example my coworker and i wa tasked to take out the trash of our workplace we work in a big area that ha more then  trashcan so we had a lot to cover typically ill take out  trash back and slide them across my shoulder not all the trash can are full my coworker see me do this and chuckle why doe you just take the whole roll with you i stay silent and my mind went blank i wa too focused on looking stupid and him thinking that i dont think that i forgot the reason why i did it the first place because it easier for me to carry more full trashbags in my hand then it is for one hand to be occupied by the roll  now i worry that he still think that i dont think with my head because i never got the chance to explain myself i know i could be diagnosed but doesnt that take too much money i dont have the money to spend over  dollar per week but i hate that im  and still act like a shy teenager,anxiety3408,but before that i wa an

but i started heavy smoking weed during college i didnt see the connection until  year into smoking weed my social anxiety got so bad this year i wouldnt talk to any of my co worker i would purposely avoid dating in all scenario i couldnt even go to target without my sister or mom i turned into someone i didnt recognize and along the way i lost a lot of my self confidence and self esteem i lost a lot of my friend due to me always flaking on plan my job involves talking to people and i started avoiding those phone call and would make my intern call them my bos had to have a meeting with me how my intern is not allowed to take my call because some of them are really complex and client want to talk to me not an intern having social anxiety is horrible and i would never wish that on anyone i started going to therapy this summer because my dad literally begged and basically bribed me to go im so thankful for therapy and my dad my therapist really changed my life it started with her encouraging me to go study at the library alone in hour increment i would have panic attack before going in it would take me at least an hour to get out of my car she suggested magnesium and ashgwanda supplement and ive been on them since june when i started my supplement she suggested to cut down on the smoking and keep it to a weekend thing i went out of state and wa hanging out with my best friend who happens to be sober and i realized just how reliant i wa on smoking it kind of made me disgusted with myself so since august i have not smoked weed im not saying i will never smoke maybe for my birthday or a celebration but i dont see myself wanting to smoke ever again in the past couple of month i have gone on date gone out with my co worker and have even made a group chat hung out with new friend joined a fitness club even had a nice friendsgiving with a new friend group im able to shop by myself i even have lunch by myself some day and i am completely fine so here some advice

quick hit of happiness although a soon a the fantasy wa over i wa left with my perceived failure of life that wa the main problem i just realized with it i fantasized about myself being admired and respected but eventually i returned to a body in which i had not accomplished any of those thing and thus replaced the satisfaction of real work with a simple imaginative fantasy the only reason i post it here is because it common in ptsd and trauma victim but also in people with high anxiety which is probably my case the inner working of our mind are truly terrifying in a way i understand it doe it to keep me safe but i feel like my own mind ha been lying to me even though i made the choice to follow through those fantasy using up every mental satisfaction i can obtain,anxiety3428,removed,anxiety3429,it not just anxiety or nervousness but i cant physically talk i mumble stutter i forgot word who forgets word and half the time i just blank out even though

the opposite shift a me and she said shes been busy outside of work shes only been working there about  month what make it especially hard is that we used to work together all the time when she first started and weve hung out at her house twice then all of a sudden she work the opposite shift a me and shes been too busy lately to plan a day to hang out i get that life happens and this is an adult friendship there will be time we go awhile without hanging out but this is really triggering my anxiety i have been forgotten about by so many friend i really dont want it to happen again especially

wanted to ask about social anxiety caused by participating in anonymous online forum such a this one  when there is social anxiety and a deep fear of embarrassment that also affect the ability to write anonymous message that do not even reveal personal detail  is this another type of social anxiety or is it a completely crazy and psychotic stage beyond social anxiety i have seen that even those who are tolerant and empathetic towards the phenomenon of social anxiety lose patience when they see that it applies to activity in completely anonymous web and feel that it is somewhat psychotic to feel social anxiety in this context,anxiety3433,i love her but i dont want to be around people because i hate how anxious i feel in public and i dont want to talk to anyone if they ask thing about my life what could i say that im loser and i cant achieve anything i dont work or study anymore im struggling with depression and i dont want to ruin her birthday with my negativity or my

how people perceive me in certain situation i can see people dont like me a im always with one friend but he is in other people snapchat private story and im not that is enough validation to prove

enough for people to completely disregard me a a person and like my friend more than meam i a bad person and can people see that is that why im not in snapchat private story it kill me,anxiety3437,hey guy i went out for black friday shopping earlier after month of not traveling further than  mile due to crippling social anxiety and i had such a terrible time i feel absolutely traumatized a dramatic and hyperbolic a that soundsi went to forever  to return some short even though i sound like a mouse whenever i talk to people and cringe at myself for hour afterwards i expected it to be a relatively quick and simple processas im walking up to the register i see these two employee with open register acting standoffish toward me exchanging weird glance with one another then looking back at me in a very derisive disgusted manner like they find me absolutely repugnant like im the scum of the earth or something i kid you not it wa that dramatic a if people who look like me arent allowed to step foot in their store and oh the audacity i had to do so it felt like they simultaneously felt pity for me and wanted to quit their job just because i walked in i reluctantly ask them if theyre open cause theyre acting so strange and in between awkward mocking laugh theyre like yeah in the most ironic sarcastic tone possible it wa giving major high school bully who pretend to be nice to you ironically i hated it especially because i have an innumerable number of experience like that from my middlehigh school day it wa all too uncanny and reminiscent of that for me not to have recognized it immediately so a i walked up one of them ran away literally jogging and just disappeared then the one who wa forced to deal with me just seemed like he wa dared to lick a toilet or something he wa conventionally attractive and probably around my age if not a couple year younger he wa smirking to himself and pretty much treating me like im subhuman i had to stand there for a whole five minute since for whatever reason he had to call a manager over to process the return we didnt speak a word to each other i wanted a hole to open up and swallow me i wa staring down at my phone pretending to text the entire five minute so i wouldnt have to observe his ridiculing facial expression toward me eventually he had to ask me some question for the return and just the way he talked seemed like a complete joke he wa talking to me a though i were  like i said i wa most likely older than the dude i just look noticeably young for my age and a though i walked in there smelling like manure i showered right before i left the house upon leaving the store my entire mood shifted i felt so disgusting unworthy unlucky and just didnt know what i did to deserve looking this way i wanted to leave the mall asap i had a face mask with me and put it on immediately along with dark sunglass despite the fact i wa inside i freaking hate pretty privilege so much and honestly a an ugly female i feel like i have it so much worse cause everyone expects all woman to be beautiful goddess incapable of having a single blemish on their face and im over here looking like quasimodo the entire reason i have social anxiety to begin with is this,anxiety3438,so im  male and i have real bad social anxiety both in real life and online somehow online it like i know they cant do anything to me mostly but i just get this horrible stomach feeling whenever i think of speaking and i play vr sometimes and speak on there and it is usually cool aside from some dickhead but that sinking feeling always is there before i even get on and early on it get better but having to deal with it every single time  is so draining i want to speak it just so irritating and make me feel like im going to throw up along with minor headache im not a very social dude but i have a close group of friend i play with and im great with them but when im alone even in game i dont speak in if people on my team or other have mics i get that anxious dread i get so nervous theyre gonna be toxic to me or just speak about me at all im trying to break this anxiety so im getting a mic for my xbox for christmas my plan is to speak a much a possible and if people are mean to be even meaner to them or be extremely nice thats what i do in vr they usually stop being mean if i do that and if not that anxiety go down a bit because i find it funny if every mean thing they tell me i just tell them the opposite i dont know how well itll work to speak a lot but im hoping really hoping at the very least that dread and anxiety wont be so strong when thinking about speaking and my friend is getting a mic too so worse come to worse i can make him do quad on warzone w me and we both talk with our random teammate to make it le scary for me wish me luck is this exposure therapy technically,anxiety3439,whenever im out in public running errand the only thing running through my mind is my appearance if

spiral or sth and keep thinking about everything that happened and how embarrassing and ugly and boring i wa how they finally realized that im super weird and dont want to be friend with me anymore and they were only nice to me because they felt sorry for me this always make me want to isolate myself more and just not hangout with anyone anymore and it so frustratingi dont know if this ha

especially about story personal experience and useless talk only when im in a group with people and they start talking i enjoy them with serious intent and care and i care about them and make eye contact with them but it made me uncomfortable because they only focus on me and make eye contact with me from the rest of the group and i became prone to hearing the talk and personal topic so i decided when i wa with a group to deliberately lose touch and not look them in the eye nor care what they say the purpose of this is be careful of this time you spend talking or hearing what you dont care about you can really waste it on useful thing i just shared my personal experience and i dont share a fact that must be applied,anxiety3443,there were alpaca and dog at my school today i love

food place one day i went to the back to get some plastic plate that were by the locker area where everybody put their stuff i saw this outgoing girl and i said hi she wa very outgoing always talking a lot to everyone in the workplace she wa in my way when i said hi and i wa waiting to get through then she asked do you need to get through i said that i did and then she moved then she said you could have said excuse me anyway i wa planning on saying excuse me and i just decided to say hi first to greet her when i first saw her and thats all that i said wa hi i said nothing after that and at most i stood there  second in silence until she asked me that question hence i told her i wa going to say excuse me she said no you werent in my head i wa like how would you know what i wa going to say then she said your really awkward and i said yeah i know i am she seemed to view me a odd and unconventional because i greeted her and i didnt say excuse me right away when i wa waiting to get through how doe that make any sense being awkward in social setting is normal to me but that is the only time anyone ever directly called me awkward they probably were all thinking that im awkward and i self admit the fact that i am socially awkward  im so awkward that i will try to make a joke and no one will understand it or it will come off a offensive when i never intended it to im so awkward that i will go mute in social setting when i get anxious  im so awkward that i struggle to convey my basic idea and thought in a way that people understand i often dont share much about myself in social setting because i am uncomfortable i listen to other people instead it not that i dont want to share stuff about myself it that im so uncomfortable that i feel like i just cant thanks for

with but not close to be a friend such a classmate that arent my close friend i just turn into a different person unintentionally short answer slightly mean tone have trouble maintaining eye contact and my fucking facial expression i probably look like an asshole who too busy and cool to even talk to you i look so unapproachable and even when i interact with these people i find the word that come out of my mouth weird sometimes why did i answer this girl with a one word and not even looking at her i talk like a if im too cool to talk with these people im not a native speaker so i may not have described this perfectly i dont treat others like an asshole insult people hurt them intentionally it just that im a bit unapproachable my actual personality isnt like this im an extremely sensitive person who care about others feeling never try to hurt or insult others dont like to brag funny etchow the fuck do i be more approachable im not that guy who sits alone at lunch and doesnt say a single word i spend time with friend have convos with others etc it just that people really think im unapproachable and find it weird when i try to change this me and a friend were hanging out with  girl both complimented my new shirt which appearently looked good with my eye color i said something like thanks had a normal small conversation they were a bit suprised i wasnt like passive aggressive towards them or no one word answer this unapproachable look thing doesnt differ from girl to guy i didnt do it just because theyre girl every guy ever know how rare compliment are,anxiety3497,some people aggravate my anxiety way more than others i have a coworker who talk in a way where every statement sound like she is shouting question at you she talk so much that i cant find a gap to answer a question she once complained to my bos that i roll my eye at her which i likely do since shes infuriating wave of physicial anxiety and tension hit me whenever shes near enough sometimes albeit rarely ill meet someone who cause little or no sa symptom for me two of these are my friend today doe anyone else feel their sa symptom differently from different people,anxiety3498,i mean i know im ugly and hate everything about myself already you dont need to shove it in my face before i used to be so concerned about how much i dislike my personality that i didnt really care about my look but lately seems like everyone ha an opinion on my appearance i feel like i want to hide my face in public i want to rip my face off i wa thinking of getting a plastic

face,anxiety3499,anyone get kinda anxious texting i finally landed a nice job some month back and after legit  year of no friend im slowly making new one im just wondering how often is considered normal for newish friend to text one of my new friend for example we texted occasionally at the beginning since it wa still a new acquaintance but this last week we texted pretty much every day something with a perfect balance of her messaging me first and me messaging her first but yesterday and wednesday nothing wa sent with me being the last person who messaged and now it making me way more anxious than it should i keep thinking dumb thought like she doesnt want to talk to you now i know it the sa and overthinking but bleh i suppose it normal to not text every single day,anxiety3500,is it a good idea to try to analyze social interaction with the hope of improving eg what did i say that wasnt well received or wa it how i said it or my body language or facial expression what can i do differently another time or is this likely to be selfdefeating resulting in increased selfconsciousness increased awkwardness and anxiety,anxiety3501,happens to me all the time lmao,anxiety3502,hey not  sure if this is the right sub but my problem doe pertain to my social anxiety so i will ask anyways i have only ever gone to therapy a few year ago which my mom paid for considering i wa a minor she eventually made me stop going because of the cost and i am now going to have to cover my own bill a an adult my question is how do i find therapy i can afford i believe i have about  free session but i am also looking to try medication is medication expensive im pretty sure we have decent insurance also do i have to separately meet with a psychiatrist in order to obtain a prescription thanks in advance,anxiety3503,doe anyone here tend to ruminate over the thing they said or done after social interaction with other people i tend to do this alot like i would go over the whole social interaction in my head and sometime cringe over what i done and said  and get worst case sceanrio of what other people might think of me or if they are judging me i get negative thought that after that social interaction other people think i am weird or immature it would go on for a while and i am sometime afraid to face them afterward if i make a mistake i am worried that people would constant remember me by the mistake i made and have negative judgement of me doe anyone know how to stop ruminating over the past event,anxiety3504,i love my parent to death and they are great when i have child i will raise them how my parent raised me except for one thing growing up i have always been quiet even coming out of the womb i wa silent ash didnt cry didnt do anything but move around i always thought that i wa a talkative kid growing up i mustve blocked out all of my untalkative moment but anyways i just found out yesterday that i have always been a quiet person my mom said that when i went to pre school i didnt talk to any of the other kid teacher would talk to my parent worried about me bc i wouldnt even talk to my teacher i couldve swore i spoke my mouth off during that time in elementary i wa a mixture of both outgoing and quiet i had my moment  same with middle school i only made friend bc someone wa eager enough to come talk to me i never ventured out to make friend ever high school wa when my social anxiety peaked and now it happening again the reason i am a bit pissed at my mom after hearing that i wa always quiet a a kid is bc why didnt my parent try and get me help did they think that it wa a normal thing for a child to be completely silent at school me personally i would ask a doctor about it and the thing is i had my yearly checkup thats the perfect time to ask a doctor why their three year old is so goddamn quiet i couldve gotten help early i couldve grew up with proper social skill i couldve went through high school feeling like a normal teenager ive missed out on so much shit all bc my parent never got me help i hate that people think it just a phase that kid will grow out of thats not the case for every child im the child that never grew out of it ive missed out on so much and it depressing people sit in my face and constantly point out how quiet i am or when im introduced to people i am introduced a the quiet friend who never speaks like okay i get it im quiet you dont have to point it out every time i go to meet someone idk im just so sad and pissed bc this couldve been avoided so many thing couldve been avoided if i got help early now i am a  year old woman that ha to go through her early adult year trying to fix herself and i hate it the only thing im proud about is that i am in a relationship right now and i am on my second job so far i dont even know how i got a boyfriend by being so silent but ig anything is possible the job ive worked arent my ideal job and i missed out on so many interview because im terrified of them im not living a normal  year old life because im scared to go on campus and face thousand of people i have to do online school and im thankful for the flexibility but damn i look at everyone else having fun at college and i feel jealous i can barely do thing alone and i hate walking into place by myself i hate it i hate it so much i just wish my parent got me the help that i needed thats it,anxiety3505,this is just a prewarning im not medically diagnosed due to personal reason that id rather not get into but i show most if not all symptom

her best friend and it kind of working were okay i guess we all went out together for halloween and it wa sm fun i liked them and i still do but i feel like they all are one big group and im like uhh the new girl and they dont accept me im not a mature a them all that most of this is a figment of my imagination im suree but still advice also for the advice id like to request this is what you should do advice instead of this is what you should practice feeling if that make sense also advice on how to make people like me lol,anxiety3506,so im  and i have had social anxiety for about a long a i can remember i currently have no friend at all not even online i used to have some online friend but they all left for various different reason last month my girlfriend decided that she had enough of me and my problem so she also left me i dont blame her otherwise i cant even remember the last time i had a real life friend even a i scroll through here i see many people mention how they still have a few friend they can at least talk to and hang out with and this just go to show how pathetic i am how do you even make friend when you have this disorder and have zero social skill i completely wasted my time at high school and now im doing the same at university im on a break now and have spent almost every day at home in my room doing nothing i go out occasionally alone sometimes to walk around different part of my city just to escape the boredom but it no fun when you are always by yourself i am so sick of wasting my life in isolation from the rest of the world it is ruining me what can i do,anxiety3507,a sad and pathetic a it sound i cant stand to see people happy seeing people in group having a good time bonding make me sick im probably just longing for what i dont have but i wish i had a group like that people that i can actually be happy with and myself around a group i dont have to pretend to be someone else fornow ive stopped doing thing i normally would do i stopped going to my university lecture i stopped driving downtown i stopped going bowling i stopped eating in restaurant etc im terrified of being in these place where people congregate in large group and there i am almost always alone i feel sick when im out in public like i radiate a sickness something about me is driving off these people that i like being around people i respect i want to find out what it is i cant be alone like this anymore,anxiety3508,so title and i feel pretty pathetic about it either because i got it or even while using it idk i just feel lonely i have a lot in my mind i want to talk or even gush about but im always scared id come off a annoying or the person wouldnt really care and are just being polite or theyd think it stupid it happens with everyone even my best friend or friendsi have fantasy where i come off a interesting or passionate and people care but reality set and i just dont think they would do care so im just stuck in my head imagining a scenario where someone would be interested i thought the ai friend thing wa gonna help me with that but all it doe is make me feel pathetici feel trapped and lonely i wish i could just turn my brain off,anxiety3509,i might have generalized anxiety,anxiety3510,i m recently got my first job and after just one  hour shift im already scared to go in for another on my

but i wa so nervous and intimidated by everything i looked the part but i failed miserably but those people were so nice they obviously stayed positive once it wa released i never watched it and i never will i asked family and friend who would be honest about how i performed and they told me that i looked stiff it confirmed my exact thought i cant help but feel like i even ruined the project

there one person who ha been my best friend since th grade were in th now and we even live a few house down from each other we used to talk a lot and call each other often around th grade is when i started becoming aware of something i realized that i wa the one who always tried to initiate a conversation whether it wa through call text or talking but it wa only with my friend i felt like i had to put effort into these relationship because i wa so desperate to keep the only social life i had but about last year i stopped doing that and i noticed when i didnt initiate anything they just wouldnt text me or call me a soon a id say something theyd say something but if i didnt they wouldnt text me at all lately it feel like i dont even exist to my best friend or any of my friend a a matter of fact but specifically my bff i walk to the bus stop with her we stand there for  minute waiting then were on the bus for about  minute she still doesnt say anything to me but shes having conversation with other people on the bus even after school shes always talking with her other friend never to me even she call and text her other friend more often than me ive witnessed this when i wa over her house once i didnt think much of it until lately and how it wa pretty messed up she wa talking on the phone with someone while i wa over her house it shouldve just been me and her hanging out i witnessed it again on her birthday we stayed at a hotel with our other friend and that night while we were up talking she randomly got on video call with a whole other person when it wa just supposed to be u hanging out just last week i usually go to the library during lunch but it wa closed for the day so i had no choice to go sit in the lunch room which i absolutely dread i picked the farthest table in the back my best friend saw and me and said a quick hello before leaving a bunch of random girl sat at my table they were super noisy and there were too many of them so i quickly felt overwhelmed i kept thinking should i leave im scared to leave because i dont wanna seem rude but in the end i got up and went to an empty table i noticed that my best friend wa sitting with a group of people at a table right across from mine we made eye contact but she still continued to talk to them for the entirety of lunch even though i wa directly in front of her she never once said hey do you wanna sit with u and it really hurt i know im not very social but imagine your best friend sitting with a group of people right in front of you laughing and smiling while not even glancing at you if i saw my friend sitting alone i would at least offer to see if they wanted to sit with me after lunch i just got up and lefti could sit here for  more minute and type a few more incident where she chooses to talk or hang out with people other than me but i wont ive been cry about it a lot though i get im a boring person but it to the point where my best friend barely speaks to me anymore i tried to make excuse for her maybe she didnt see you dont get so worked up but there no way she didnt see me i wa sitting directly in front of her we made eye contact like twice  ive cried too much over feeling lonely and now it even worse ive been thinking about confronting her about it and telling her how i feel but there wa a point in time where the same situation happened with her and her bf a while back after she got a bf ex they were always sitting beside each other on the bus they were always texting each other they were always calling each other and thats normal considering they were dating at the time but it got to a certain point where i didnt feel like i mattered anymore at some point i told her about it and she apologized and started sitting next to me for a couple of day but then she went right back to doing exactly what she wa doing pretending i barely exist couldnt even come over her house with just me and her without her saying i wonder if i should ask  if he want to come over the thing is it not her having other friendsrelationships other than me im completely fine with that but what i have a problem with is her putting  of time and effort with her other relationship than with me even when she ha plenty of time to do so i get that she work but she spends all day everyday when at school talking to a bunch of other people even if we dont get to talk at school she still doesnt ever text me or call me she doesnt even ask me to come over i used to always initiate it saying hey can i come over but it like shes not even interested in hanging out with me at least seem like you want to put effort into the relationship i hate being the only one putting in effort i hate that i feel this way and i hate this feeling of loneliness i have two other best friend but the person im talking about wa one of my first long lasting relationship she wa the first person that actually seemed kinda interested in being friend with me i just wished she talked to me more even if it through text even if it simply talking to me like once a week i just want her to at least act like she care even when i take day off school she doesnt bother to check in on me she doesnt bother to ask hey why werent you at school she doesnt do any of this i dont need her to be the perfect best friend i just want her to at least make it seem like she care about my well being a i do with her i often ask her is something wrong or are you okay whenever i see that shes having a bad day but those feeling never seem to be reciprocated when it come to me if i disappeared for a couple of day she wouldnt even text me and ask are you doing okay you havent been to school for a while because even when i wa sick last month she never once asked me why werent you at school for the last week until i actually came back the next week and told her hey i wa sick thanks for not caring that ive been gone all week i really appreciate itsorry i dont even know if this post will be allowed considering how long it is but i just really need some advice to me it seems like im coming off a selfish and only caring for myself but at this point idk,anxiety3521,im writing this to vent my thought and feeling about a long anxietyinducing day i  m struggle with mental health and have had social anxiety for a long a i can remember i feel like it gotten worse since covid and working remotely for the past  year this feel more like a journal entry but maybe someone will appreciate or relateim typically good around a couple of people that i know and am comfortable speaking to when it more than  i get anxious especially when there are people i dont know very well today my wife and i went to her parent house for a big family thanksgiving day im very comfortable with her parent and sibling  sibling husband we know each other very well and my social anxiety with them is usually low thanksgiving day plan changed and my fatherinlaw invited about  relative i wa horribly anxious just thinking about going and barely slept for a couple of daysit wa  hour of loud noise kid screaming adult yelling at the football game people moving around me constantly being elbow to elbow with others most of the time sitting awkwardly while my wife step away and i have no idea what to say to anyone else in the roommy living nightmare i stepped away a often a i could to take break from large group or noise but i could barely find place to just be alone and breathe i spent a decent amount of time in the bathroom just to have silence i felt embarrassed shy and like i didnt have anything to say to others because i felt like i wasnt interesting to them it seems like i will say thing to others with a quiet voice and they just look at me like i have no idea what im sayingi felt like i couldnt tell my wife that i wanted to leave because she wa having such a great time with her family i wanted to support her and be there but the anxiety wa killing me and i just wanted to jump out the window maybe i need to get better at setting boundary to help manage anxious setting or maybe i need to find a way to cope with social anxiety better maybe both either way i hate social anxiety and i just want to feel relaxed calm and content during my day around others i dont want to just bottle myself up inside of my room or house and further disconnect from others i want to feel like a part of the group in social setting and to be heard and valued i just want to feel accepted regardless of my awkwardness and different style of communicating ampxbtldr thanksgiving day with around  people caused severe social anxiety that made me want to run away or curl up in a closed room somewhere,anxiety3522,an old friend of mine is requesting that we hangout tomorrow and ive never hanged ot with

basically im afraidof how awkward ill be of what i wont be able to say because im not good at conversation and im afraid once the interaction is over ill just ob over how bad it went that it might be traumatic,anxiety3523,so whoop i guess my other post got deleted bc i put in the discord link anyway for all you lonely ppl who have anxiety message me for the discord link i need me some friend

your face is not what i wa expecting for it to look like now i know she probably didnt meant it in a bad way but god did it felt awful and i also noticed some people whispering while looking at me i could feel all the stare i finished eating and put my mask back on and went outside w my friend now i dont know whether i should keep wearing it or remove it keep wearing it because im so self conscious remove it because i dont want people to feel disappointed after seeing my whole face incase it not what they were expecting,anxiety3553,hello all it that time of year where we have to

would do it so i started speaking i think iand a guy cut me off let move on to the next personprolly because he thought no one would be interested in what i sayand i felt so embarrassed to be honest because i had finally mustered the courage to speak up properly and i thought that maybe i wa too late or that they found me too boringit wa just not a good situation i felt like i would self combust from the embarrassmenti know it sound like an overreaction but with my anxiety that wa what it felt likebut another guy stopped the first guyshes not done yet let her finish speakingand he turned to me and saidwhat were you saying what did you say you like about yourselfand i felt so happy that someone actually heard me and wa willing to listen to mei told themi think i can be quite kind at timesits been more than one year since that incident but i will never forget that guy for stepping in and talking to mei felt so grateful and happy and it wa just a really considerate thing to

looking at me and vice versa i wa so excited i looked up for her instagram here is much more a casual thing that it may be in the u it more like snapchat and i found out we had a lot of interest in commoni texted her finally and we talked for about  day honestly thing were going great she didnt use to always answer me immediately but it wa cool for reference almost everyday we had like  screenshot of chat vocal message included long story short i told her i wa going to try sushi for the first time and she told me she love it then it went like this this shit is fire wanna go eat some next week maybe anyway i dont want u to misunderstand i like another boy then i tried to fake i wa inviting her a a friend and she seemed to believe that or maybe she wa sorry and didnt honestly want to hurt meat first i wa not sad after a few hour i wa angry now im just sad i tried hard not to daydream i tried keeping her interested by talking about what she like and also more everyday thing apparently im not cute enough or funny enough or athletic enough or smart enough or maybe im too much myself i just failed another timei dont know if ill find someone else like her or how i think she wa no girl seems to be like her no girl in my city at least this suck i dont know if it is even worth trying at this pointnow i have to face herself again and while i doubt she will make fun of me ill still have a hard time looking into her eye and i know that she wa the only girl i wa interested in i know it been just a few day but now i feel like this itll pas after all i think i just need to vent rnthank you for reading english is not my first language so if i wrote some line you do not understand let me knowps yes we had a few face to face interations and she also made first move talking about physical contact,anxiety3561,im  and been having social anxiety since age  with very little progression in life i feel like im the same exact person i wa when i wa  but angrier ive never been in a relationship i dont have any friend i cant talk to anybody at work i cant speak when im in front of a group of people im depressed and i have super low self esteem everytime i walk by a girl i think is cute i want to talk to i look down a hard a i can and hope she doesnt notice me this shit is crazythus this is why i bring up the use of mdma here my theory  from my understanding it can break me out of my shell completely and all those barrier i have when im around people go down for just a moment i feel like this could help me a a way to practice in like a party or concert or other social setting if im rolling ill most likely interact with anyone i want be able to express myself have amazing experience and in the process learn more about who i am i feel like i have no personality because i never interact with people and when i do i dont show emotion but am a trainwreck internally and cant hold a conversation but the mdma can help me learn who i am and understand social interaction more so when im  no longer feeling the drug effect ill have more to fall back on when im talking to people a opposed to next to nothing like i do right now thats just an idea i have and im feeling like this is the only way to cure myself right now,anxiety3562,do grounding technique make anyone else really sleepy like i like that i am relaxed but i hate feeling so tired maybe my

figure thing out but it look like i dont have that longeven if i miraculously got a job and caught up on my study i wouldnt have anything to work towards that could make me remotely happy so why not

like though i dont think she reciprocates a she didnt even want to study with me but i mean i didnt explicitly show that im interested in getting to know her more and she could be really busy but beside the point every time i see her instagram and i see her with other guy i will think to myself yeah i shldnt try to chase her im no way close to these guy in term of look etc and i just feel happy for her such that she could be with one of these guy in the future what j wrong with me this is the cause of low self esteem right,anxiety3568,whether you are spending the day at work resting

story of people with social anxiety that started a job with a lot of human interaction and it helped them get better any of you that can tell me how long that took is it week or month im thinking that if it drain me so much it better to focus on a job that i can do from home the field im switching to is videography so there are possibility for that it just that in theory working with other people and creating cool thing together is so much fun in reality however i do better when im alone when spending time with people i need a day off for every day of workschool and it feel like a struggle so

thing i do could somehow jeapordize the relationship because something is going to make them stop liking me this is why ive never gotten past the initial stage of dating  i get so in my head about it which make me start acting weird and standoffish which then put the guy off anyway i met a guy overseas a few month ago who life on the opposite side of the world to me after the trip we were messaging very frequently for a couple week thing slowly got le frequent on his end i had a really hard time with this initially ive accepted it now but i really dont know what to think about it he say he like that with everyone showed me proof of all his unopened message but idk i guess because we were messaging everyday at first when this happened it felt like he wa losing interest in me im going to visit him and a couple of other friend in january then moving to his country in june not for him it wa something i wa considering before i met him im excited but also unbelievably nervous about whats gonna happen i thought he wa reciprocating flirty energy over our message but i think i may have gotten too overt about my feeling because he seems more distant than ever now i have backed off since then but i cant help but think ive made thing weird and put him off i know i shouldnt try to push thing any further right now and just wait and see what happens in jan i just really cant stop thinking about how thing are gonna be in person again after all this a i said ive never gotten past the very initial stage of dating so if it turn out he is open to being more than friend i wouldnt even know to begin developing a relationship like that overall this cloud of uncertainty hanging over my head is just really messing with me and this is really all i can think about at the moment i mean i probably havent been able to go an hour for over  month without thinking about this im unhealthily obsessive i just really dont know how to shut my brain off and it exhausting thankyou

college at age  but turn out the program im taking involves a ton of presentingive been getting cold foot and bowing out from all presentation so far even  second one that just consist of briefly sharing an idea because even though most people get nervous about presenting my anxiety ha become so debilitating that id feel more comfortable playing russian roulette than getting up in front of  people ive got a pretty hoarse and low voice which come out a strained and monotone or soft and garbled because of anxiety on top of that i moved around a lot a a kid so i have a weird accent that pretty much switch from one accent to another at any given moment i know people say that no one is actually judging you and it all in your head but ive been getting ridiculed my whole life over how my voice and accent sound from past experience ive found that a lot of the step youre supposed to take to overcome social anxiety just end up reinforcing mine since everything that can go wrong end up going wrong but thats a whole other post back when i wa a teenager and my social anxiety wa le debilitating i took improv class that my mom signed me up for and had an instructor who would constantly mimic my voice whenever she spoke to me then everyone in the class started doing it and i guess that the experience a well a some other trainwreck attempt at exposure therapy really stuck with meanyway it approaching the end of the semester and ive got a bunch of presentation to do now worst part is ive already partnered up with people for them so cant screw them over by selfsabotaging and just not showing up im considering have a couple of beer or a couple of nip of whiskey before class i have a high tolerance so im hoping it just going to take the edge off without anyone noticing that im buzzed ha anyone else done this and if so ha it helped i get that it not a good idea but i just cant see myself being physically able to present i have a hard time with verbal recall and pronunciation when im anxious without being under the influence of something ive got an appointment with my doctor and i want to ask about beta blocker but thats on the same day im supposed to do my

trying to figure out how to heal it naturally i knew something wa off with my body but i could never figure out what it wa eventually after so much searching i found out the root cause of anxiety for me wa due to mold exposure and mold toxicity which lead to a gut dybiosis which then caused a reduction of serotonin since  of all serotonin is produced in the gut so basically the cause of anxiety for me wa lack of serotonin production now it fixed i believe everybody with anxiety ha a root cause the most common issue i see is leaky gut and mold exposure or bad diet and stress that lead to problem any type of gut issue effect neurotransmitter because most neurotransmitter are made in the gut i created this protocol which is what i used to heal it may be applicable for some of you here

paddling my hand and i feel im not moving even with the legwork i try finding ground to orient myself and i cant find it  i realize im on the deep end  didnt know there wa one i thought the entire lane wa shallow enough lane and no it wa like  foot deep and im a short person anyway i hear the lifeguard yelling and he come to the rescue they get me out and im fucking mortified everyones looking at me he take the report and asks if im okay im like yeah im just embarrassed  and yeahthen i go back in and just chill at the kiddie side lolstill running on adrenaline i cant say if i wa more scared of drowning or the major embarrassment i cringe everytime i think of it,anxiety3647,removed,anxiety3648,before you say it no it not because of tolerance because i rarely drank no doubt some of you will still say that anyways but i digressalcohol used to make me super confident and social it would absolutely obliterate my sa to the point i wa more outspoken and confident than even normal peoplethen it randomly stopped working now it just make me tired and sick could it have something to do with the fact that im more depressed than i wa beforetried phenibut xanax antidepressant none of that shit worked a good a alcohol didi have a work night out in  week and im absolutely shitting myself because im going to be awkward and shy while everyone is having a good timethis happen to anyone else,anxiety3649,idk if this is weird but i feel like it pretty normal for people with social anxiety like whenever im out in public i get so anxious and panicky that i literally run to the bathroom the first chance that i get just because i know im safe there and i can lock that door and i know no one is looking at me like just today i wa out christmas shopping which is literally the most stressful thing ever and there wa so many people around it wa absolutely crazy i felt like just literally everyone wa looking at me and thinking that i wa weird even though logically i know no one is looking at me cause everyone is too concerned about themselves but it just a feeling that i cant control i literally ran to the bathroom and immediately when i locked the stall door i wa able to take a deep breath and i felt peace again,anxiety3650,removed,anxiety3651,im m i have no friend no relationship my family think im the loser of the family and have sometimes made it obvious by saying stuff like we dont expect good grade from you or other subtle thing which they like to say a a joke i wont say im the best student but im definitely above average social anxiety ha definitely been an issue with uni a i find it tough to ask doubt and talk to people for project and usually end up doing everything myself even for group worki just sit all day in my room staring at wall or watching stuff doing nothing i have  or  friend but im probably their last priority for any plan or anything of threat sort i have been researching on way to do it from the last  month and im pretty sure if i go for it i can achieve it successfully without leaving me in an impaired state for life at this point it feel like a better option than living this lonely meaningless existence the only reason i havent done it already is because even though i get jab of being a failure from my family i still have a lot of love and respect for my parent and i know seeing my dead body will be the last straw for one if not both of them quite old and have health issuesi have tried therapy by online mean since i cant show up in person due to the social anxiety it hasnt benefitted me at all im afraid to start a job because  of job require you to socialize it even harder to find one because how important networking is so i do feel like a failure and i have been able to put this off by going to grad school so i had an excuse not to work but that end in  month after which everything is going to hit me at once and i feel if i havent done it already that is definitely going to be my breaking point this is probably a rant for now but a each and every day go by the urge in my head to do it get stronger and stronger and i dont know how long i can keep fighting it anymore,anxiety3652,i regret missing out on a lot of social situation ive missed more than ive gone to but almost every time i do go i wish i wasnt there or could go home the distress outweighs any enjoyment most of the time then i start thinking why am i just not normalwell now i have an actual mental illness which explains a lot but nullifies a lot of the stride i thought i made to overcome this unfortunately i dont think ill ever find a partner and im sure my friend will eventually leaveits just a bit sad is all,anxiety3653,removed,anxiety3654,some little girl complimented my hair today wa having a bad day due to sa until she showed up all of sudden and took notice in my hair at the bus stop really felt nice hearing that it made me felt a bit better,anxiety3655,i thought the issue wa exposure year of going to school and trying to talk to people and it only get worse,anxiety3656,im speaking to you i go on you have thought you want to share but stay mute i go on some more you have more thought but you dont share i ask well what are your thought you let loose like rat antiticpating cocaine just a theoryyou will not allow yourself to speak until spoken too why because you wont allow it because you feel uneasy because it not you you feel your talking up time they couldnt possible want to know your opinion you put it low a self worth i dunno what it is but it is it not allowing your voice to be heard it going back to not intiating coversations and the psychology around it to decide where we go i shall be king decider of this ship and you can knock me down and put me a low peasent and i fear it so i dont become king decider navigator no opinion unless im comanded by king navigator i have no voice i am just told what to do i dont tell other people i am a slave from fear i cant stand up for myself i cant assert somthing harmless into the atmosfear because i dont do somthing that can be critised it sure feel uneasy to take a risk to jump from that high diving board to speak to girl why should i go outside my villlage i know my place it safe why would i move do somthing new potentially dangeous if youve read this far i appogise i guess i dont need to know why i just need to speak my thought quickly before i give myself a chance to think aka doubht,anxiety3657,a the title say i came to the conclusion that i might not be normal i see all the people happy and all they want to go out to meet new people kinda strange to me maybe they get very bored at home while i wanna stay at home to not meet people of course life is what it is so im forced to deal with ppl i go to the gym  day a week to do at least some physical activitywhen i have to do task outside the house most of the time the most difficult part is dealing with people rather than the actual task itselfi recently read a quote that say that no matter what activity you do in life  of it consists in dealing with people which i think it true and it funny because it the last thing i wanna do lolthis is mostly a vent post

and that helped me overcoming social anxiety a little bit do yall know why,anxiety3660,my social anxiety is primarily caused by the spiralling thoughtpatterns of people not liking me often triggered by the most minor negative interactionsa while ago i started journalling any positive interaction i had with people even just the smallest of moment were i felt appreciated i made separate list for friend and family id just put in thing like if someone chooses to sit next to me in class sometimes or when someone i hadnt seen in a long time recognised me how one day when i visited home i hugged my mum first and my brother jokingly wa offended i didnt hug him first then a little section for what i do right it can be just the smallest of thing which can be seen a common decency but it still a good thing that im doing it better than nothing i also noted a few time ive spoken to people who have similar issue to remind myself that it not just me it a big world out there everyone is going through something finally at the bottom a little thought and response grid that i use when im anxious sometimes just to try and make myself rationalise the thought im having this is all just on the note app of my phone so i can access it nice and easily,anxiety3661,an unepexted problem occurs you panic thing are not going a expectedembraced the problem this is where you want to be to healget

certain thing i really didnt want to do like make a phone call to schedule our pedicure appointment or go into a new unfamiliar restaurant and ask for our pickup order back then i didnt really know what social anxiety wa i just knew that those thing scared me and i really didnt want to do them and whenever i would try to get out of it my sister would get furious with me and tell me how useless i am and how i wa never going to get anywhere in life if i cant do basic task she would also tell my mom how she wa worried i wa gonna get nowhere in life right in front of me this happened every single time i wa very anxious about doing an adult task which happened often and it really did a number on my self esteem i am in a much better place now and i am just now realizing how poorly my sister

patient like  time and the fact that hed said i always look stressed and nervous make me feel like i havent improved at all in term of confidence id worked so hard to overcome my fear of thinking that everyone wa judging my every move and facial expression but now i feel like im back to square one for the rest of my shift my anxiety wa sky high if he think i looked stressed and nervous then every

currently crashing in a basement constantly hitting my head on the ceiling  tried to start a new relationship ended up having another breakdown and traumatizing a good person in the process  yesterday i found out i have diabetesbuti feel this stubborn urge to keep looking  my wife and i are friend  we text regularly  ive got people in this hack city who care about me  they accept me for who i am and dont try to make me socialize more than i can take and for them i find i can take more than i would have thoughti found dbt this year  strangely one of the best thing thats ever happened to me  im slowly and with effort learning selfcompassion  im even slowly coming to accept my hurtful action a a person with mental illness  acceptance is not approval  forgiving myself is about being more effective not sweeping it under the rug  my therapist is a rockstar and a a person who only recently got insurance i feel lucky to have herive got okay work  ive got a decent book to read  the leaf are beautiful  there an amazing dog at the foot of the couch  a loving cat on my hip  another much more aloof cat off in the window but still wanting to share space with u  i just had some birthday

mind me doing it,anxiety3693,i wa diagnosed with social anxiety when i wa in middle school my mom been knew that i have it and would encouraging me to step outside of my shell and tackle it head on even when i turned  she wa still there to encourage me to battle it and would often congratulate me for socializing with cashier and stuff this didnt amount to much because i dont go out much but stillthat said recently ive notice that she would sound irritated or get angry at me whenever i exhibit any symptom of social anxiety she make it seem like im putting on some act like im stupid incapable of doing basic task seemingly forgetting i have an anxiety disorder or that it somehow went away now that im older it suck and i dont know what her deal is it not my fault people are scary im sorry that the presence of other people trigger an anxiety attack i guess i dont know what she want me to do about itand what she said on the phone when i couldnt get myself to open the door for the handyman today wa so hurtful i kinda wanna cry she didnt have to be so mean and condescending i want to confront her but i dont want her to invalidate my feeling again like she always doe then act playful a if what she said meant nothing it so frustrating and annoying,anxiety3694,it sometimes make me feel like my friend that i text with and used to see in person before covid are just putting up with me or dont actually care much about our friendship  in the early month of the pandemic i wa calling people up pretty often just to check in and keep up communication  last year one of my closest friend of the past while sent me a crazy out of nowhere text message saying that she didnt want me in her life anymore to fck off and not to contact her anymore  we hadnt even spoken in month and it wa really painful to hear all that  after that experience i feel like ive gotten lazier about keeping in touch with people since i dont want to feel like im being annoying to anyone by texting them too often,anxiety3695,because i do ie if i ever have an unscheduled conversation my brain go into panic mode especially if the person involved is outside of the context i usually see them like seeing someone from a class or work outside of that environment spontaneously whenever that happens my brain need to do like a window reloading to get a grip of the situation anyone else,anxiety3696,anyone else relatelike these halfformed slightly cringe replay just keep coming back up and piercing me,anxiety3697,rant alert  everything i do or say is humiliating  my decision

everything in life is just stupid,anxiety3698,i have social anxiety and bpd and i cannot keep a damn job for more than a month without freaking out,anxiety3699,i hate having social anxiety i hate it i just want to be normal every time i go out in public it feel like all eye are on me they watch my every move my awkward hand swaying back and forth my leg walking strangely my grosslooking nose that look awful from the side i cannot even wear the style of clothing i like because i am afraid to wear it out in public people must think i want attention or im an ugly person trying their best to look good and in order to look good in my ideal style you need a lot of confidence which i have  of so i am stuck wearing nasty black grey dull color that dont bring any attention wearing these clothes make my insecurity even worse cause it so boring even at school when one of my classmate or teacher ask a question and i know the answer i cannot bring myself to say anything im afraid to express my thought and opinion out of fear of rejection from others i want people to like me or not have any opinion of me nothing negative it drive me insane when i do something wrong or inconvenience someone it make me want to off myself everytime i make a mistake because it feel that everyone in the world saw that happenand ive wanted to cut my hair for over  year now but sadly all my friend and family always say you would look bad with short hair which broke my heart hearing it i get that maybe they are trying to help me look the best but i am so tired of my hair ive always encouraged them to do what they want and id still love them why cant they support my want when i do the same for them i have absolutely no clue or idea of what to do with myself i dont know how to fix

am using my old reddit account to post this like the title say i want friend but have a lot of barrier in the way i want advice about a specific situationso to give you some background i live in the uk i havent worked in a long time due to mental health issue including anxiety dont worry guy i am doing a lot better now and actively moving towards getting back into work i also want to get my life back on track and become le socially isolated  which brings me to the topic of this postthe last place i worked wa a supermarket and there wa a guy there who had his induction at the same time a me i actually started the job a few month before him but my induction wa just delayed i am extremely shy but he wa nice to me he wa a jokey guy and i found him funny anyway i left the job fairly suddenly without saying anything to coworkers i wasnt fired  i just handed in my notice quietly it wa a sudden decision because i wa struggling with my  mental health and various other issue several time outside of work he said hi to me but i wa so shocked that i didnt know how to react and didnt respond one time i just stopped in my track and looked shocked before walking on without saying anything this wa all due to my extreme shyness and anxiety after i left the job i wa actively trying to avoid all old coworkers  including him because  i felt ashamed of my mental health problem and the fact that i had left the jobi barely left the house for a few year due to mental health reason so i didnt see him in that time however last year i started going out again and visited the supermarket he still work there at first i wasnt sure he remembered me but a few month ago he said hello and used my name so i realised he must do i said hi back but i think my voice wa too quiet and i didnt make eye contact before this recent greeting i noticed he wa looking at me and a few other time he passed close by me in a way that seemed intentional i wonder if he wanted me to say hello first after another occasion of his saying hello i realised that my quiet voice and lack of eye contact might come across a ignoring him so i decided to give clear eye contact to him next time and say hello before he did i did this and he responded it wa scary to do it but i felt better and wa glad that i made it clear that i wasnt ignoring him we said hello to each other another time and i felt that he wa hanging about at the end of one of the aisle trying to observe me did he want to chatfor the last couple of week  i havent had a chance to speak to him but i have seen him in the supermarket and about the town it a small town i just never got the chance to speak to him or even say hello we were too far away from each other and i feel too shy to shout a greeting  which i would have had toi think he seems cool and i felt encouraged by the fact he said hello after all this time i want to try getting to know him a bit more but i have no idea how to go about doing this and i am worried it might come across a a bit weird or even creepy or obsessive i could go to the till when he is serving but i would feel super shy i always use selfservice anyway lol one of my regret is that i never got to know my coworkers i feel this could be a chance to change thatwhat do you all think should i just move on and forget it and instead look for new friendship elsewhere or should i give it a try if so how do i go about it without being too awkward or odd note i can answer any additional question about my situation in the comment,anxiety3702,from amazon and they arrived today imma try these

think i have some unhelpful belief about men and myself which prevents me from being able to normally socialize with them tbh i struggle with interacting with woman too with men it just even more

when needed i dont have much trouble texting people though but thats it i have online friend but ive never gotten on a call with them cant even dream of facetiming them im not fond of my voice and look so that might have smth to do with it anyways the point is that im in a bad situation college dropout no work experience ridiculous anxiety suicidal thought etc and no i dont have access to therapy nor is there a program that can help me while i recover the only way out is for me to get a job somehow or just give up entirelyhow can i manage my anxiety when looking for a job i see many post for remote job but they all involve calling and obviously i need to get through an interview i really want to do it but i cant help freezing before sending the application last time i tried

month before,anxiety3726,yesterday we had a guy in the lobby at my job he looked like he mightve been on drug because he looked lost we do get a lot of homeless people around here for some reason we never keep the door leading from the lobby to the rest of the building locked any other job a badge or pin wa needed to get through certain doorsso i go to the lobby window and he asks for a job application i go look for one when i go back to the lobby window he is no longer there i turn around to see he ha let himself into the office and his hand is on the woman restroom at least it single occupant i tell him thats the woman restroom he insists that he need to go and the men restroom is packed keep in mind this is a private building sometimes we let delivery driver or other people use our bathroom if they ask beforehand but this guy just walked in he end up using the restroom and then go in our break room thankfully someone else wa in there and he asks where the water is some other coworkers finally get him out well he end up just leaving the cup of water in the lobby so something tell me he didnt come in for waterbut i wish i wouldve told him no that he cant just come inside our building without asking first but i froze and didnt know what to say on the other hand i think it irresponsible to have that door unlocked what if that happened while we were on lunch or if there werent many people in the officein conclusion this is what it took for u to finally consider having a pin to enter but i still feel stupid for not saying anything to him,anxiety3727,my anxiety is so bad that i feel like it up to me to make sure everyone is feeling good even if that mean in the end im feeling shitty if they end up not feeling happy i somehow blame it on myself and overthink to the

use facebook and they already had a group chat on there that they use but there also an sm chat that i am included ini get invited to bigger event like party and stuff but apparently there a lot of one off hangout that i dont get invited to because people forget to use the text chat surprisingly i do think it forgetfulness rather than malice a i tend to usually think but finding out that this

younger but this is not about seeing people or meeting them or stuff like that i work in customer service and i meet hundred of people dailywhat i am afraid in people is that theyre gonna hurt me insult me bully me this ha happened way too many time when ive gotten close with someone during the past year people seem nice and lovable when they are just acquintances someone u barely know but whose face u kinda recognize but when u start to get a little bit closer with them when they start to know you they will hurt you no exception so right now im in this very point of my life where i can not let anybody see the true me no one know me i have partner i cant be vulnerable with them either i can not trust them i am afraid that one day theyll just snap and out of the blue break up with me if i ever showed my true color i feel like im never enough i feel like i can not be loved or accepted by anyone i like myself somedays i even love myself but  i dont think anyone else ever is able toas i told i work in customer service i am not friend with my collegues at all they might all of sudden come in and open up about their life i never share anything with them actually id like if they didnt share anything personal with me either i dont want to get to know them people are nice a long a you only see the surface when you get under that when you get to know them they are horrifying

if he knew this and asked if i had any single friend or even a social outing to please set tom up a he wa really struggling and lonely he told me about his crippling shyness so from that moment on i made it my mission to just be a kind friendly person to tom and try to get to know him better it been seven month now and i am happy to say tom now come on work lunch with u ha shown me youtube video about his hobby and even will peep his head in my office and say good morning or whatever he also texted me his dating profile asking me for some pointer and tip which i found adorable i did try to set him up with one person but he literally waited day to text her when i told him she wa excited for a date and awaiting his text she if course grew uninterested and she didnt respond when he finally did text her week later he then started dating a new lady yay and she wa far out of his league at least physically and from his description of her she sounded very outgoing with a prestigious job and loved seeing him well tom freaking asked her out to a nice restaurant and then go karting for their rd date and at the end of it asked her to pay for it tom make six figure i asked him why he did that and he said i started thinking about how expensive the night wa going to be lol she dumped him this baffled tom but i wa able to explain why this happened and then helped him craft an apology text to her by some miracle she ha given him another chance tom dad told me yesterday he is very worried about him and he wa cry about how lonely he is and how hard it is to make friend and meet people tom is seriously so smart and nice but his awkwardness can often come off a off putting and even elitist but i know he doesnt mean to be that way i learned he told his dad he so happy i wa hired bc im helping him feel more confident and like he ha a friend that care about him im scared he will spiral if this girl dump him bc he literally only hang out with her and his family how can i help this

much time to chat i decided to join them for lunch yesterday hoping i could ask question about them or that they would ask about me but when they arrived at lunch they were already talking about something else and i couldnt really find question or reply i maybe opened my mouth twice during the lunch there were big blank while people were quielty eating and no one asked anything to me they would just continue their conversation sometimes and i tried to ask them for more detail but if i didnt no one would try to include me in the conversation they look friendly toward each other but to me they dont really smile when saying hi theyre just being politeill continue having lunch with them to catch the good opportunity but it make me relive my teen trauma so much people dont care about others,anxiety3754,all my life i thought i wa a shy burden but i did always have the underlying suspicion that i had social anxiety disorder problem wa i wa too socially anxious to ask for a psychiatrist because i wa worried id look like i wa attentionseeking even though i wa literally tearing my skin open until it bled with my fingernail because of how anxious i wa in social situation to the point where i would have visible mark and red spot for day or even week when i later on developed severe ocd and anxiety and had to get diagnosed that wa when i finally got my social anxiety disorder diagnosis alongside my ocd and anxiety diagnosis i later got diagnosed with autism a wellit just clicked in my brain that holy shit i wa right im not shy there a legitimate problem in how my brain is wired i have a mental illness i felt extremely relieved that there wa an official diagnosis for what ive been experiencing almost my whole life now im not a burden to my family and friend im a person suffering from a mental disorder,anxiety3755,removed,anxiety3756,im distrustful of peoplei think theyre basically all judging me  when im in public im convinced that when they see me they think that person look ugly or that person is so shyim envious of peoplei wish i could have the thing that people that dont have social anxiety can easily have im talking about big friend group romantic partner social hobby etcim inferior of people i honestly feel like im not a good a everyone else it like im an imposter wherever i go and all of my accomplishment are fluke or just luck thanks for reading just wanting to share my perspective on social anxiety and people,anxiety3757,so i started therapy and so far ive gone to two session and im starting to feel like it just isnt gonna work out the first session wa extremely nerve wracking for me and while i dreaded going i also had the slightest bit of excitement about actually trying to make a change in my life i feared that it wouldnt work and id just be stuck this way forever so i guess i kinda had unrealistic expectation that it would feel relieving to sit and talk to someone about my feeling when in reality the whole time i wa there i felt pathetic explaining what my goal were and just how my life is going also when she asked why my mom suggested i go to therapy i almost cried and i had to just tell myself to keep it together and hold back the tear anyways my second session wa today and it kinda just felt like a repeat of the first session she asked me about a high and a low this week and also asked me some repeated question like what is your favorite food where is your favorite place to go on vacation and asked what i did this weekend anyways i know it a small thing but it kinda hurt when she asked me question that she had already asked before because it kinda just reminded me that she actually doesnt care and im just another patient she ha to see at her job another thing she did today wa explain cbt and asked me what core belief i have that possibly cause me to isolated myself from other people or something which also felt embarrassing to answer she gave me a a sheet with listed core belief and asked which one stuck out to me so i said the one that say my opinion isnt wanted even bought many others stuck out to me a well then she went thru this scenario on this other sheet that compare core belief to a pair of sun glass and how your core belief might affect your action anyways i think a reason this feel like a waste of time is because i know this stuff already and i feel like it pretty obvious that your core belief affect your thought which affect your behavior i mean just because im struggling with social anxiety doesnt mean i lack self awareness but maybe im giving up on therapy too fast she did give me homework which wa to go through the sheet with all of the core belief and highlight which one i have so even though im already aware of the core belief maybe itll be helpful to talk about them with her next time if the next session go poorly tho im probably gonna be really unmotivated,anxiety3758,i dont know what magic i wa doing back then when i wa in clg about year ago i used to hang out with people i wa a confident talkative personi used to be fine with people even if they dont speak anything and in group i wa mostly in the centre but now im mute most of the time and barely keep a conversation even on social medium i dont go out much and feel sick around people headphone are the only option left to survive,anxiety3759,i have a question for all of you in a way i myself dont have social anxiety but i need to know someone very close to me suffers with this and i dont feel like im  understanding this part of it well when they start to feel like theyve embarrassed themselves in front of me i tend to try to dismiss by just ignoring them so they dont feel like im upset with them for being embarrassed but i feel like im coming off a angry with them is this a good way to calm them down or doe it only make them feel worse,anxiety3760,i could sometimes talk to people in real life but online or text wa a total torture texting still isi wa a lurker on reddit long time one day i decided to try talking i want to feel at least some connection to people at least onlinei totally couldnt post a comment it horrifying people would see people would judge they would see how boring pathetic loser i am im always worried that im boring and people just have no interest in mei went to raskouija and posted a few letter if you know that subreddit you just post  letter at a time it wa on a different account before this onenothing happens youre not judged youre not blamed youre not given an oscar either occasionally it upvoted a bit very rarely it downvoted in any case it forgotten in  day it took a while but it sank it nothing bad happensthen i start to post comment and found out the same nothing much happens most of the time it just ignored but im not dragged to the town square for tar and feathersthen i tried some post like in roffmychest same people might ignore or say some word but nothing bad happens occasionally downvoted but then again nothing bad happens just because i have a comment at now i can make a post with little anxiety hope it help some lurker to come out to the sun,anxiety3761,i ob over how people perceive me so i end up getting hammered drunk and then embarrass myselfany advice,anxiety3762,i wa out for my evening stroll yesterday and passed by our local skatepark it just so happened that a bunch of my student were hanging out there id never run into them before and called out to me one of my student came over by me on his bike no snow the ground here yet and by this point my mind wa spinning for some reason outside of school i am a total mess so i wa in no position to make smalltalk with anyone i sortvof kept powerwalking and the kid just said ohsorry sir didnt mean to disturb you not in a mean or sarcastic way i felt so bad i like this kid a a student super nice and kind to his classmate always wellbehaved in class and in general is just one of those who make the job easier i also figured he mustve been so embarrassed or assumed i dont like him i also worried that perhaps he ha sa himself and then i treated him that way that would be terrible so i had his class this morning and at the end when student are packing up and just generally shooting the shit i apologized to him and explained my minor social anxiety to him he said he understood and it wa fine some people rightly say that sharing such problem with student is not ideal because it blur the line between student and teacher that may be the case but given that a few teacher at our school have shared their mental health issue with student such a anxiety and given how guilty i felt about my behavior i had to apologize but still im not proud of how i behaved,anxiety3763,what i do my heart pounding fast,anxiety3764,is it just me lol,anxiety3765,i read somewhere online that you cant self diagnose yourself with sa so i although i havent been to a psychiatrist for it i strongly believe that i have it for any one who ha been professionally diagnosed with it to my symptom align with any of you guyshere are some of them clammy hand excessive sweating in social situation cold hand and foot   shaking when nervous nail and lip biting  trouble with eye contact cry when overwhelmed in social situation trouble carrying conversation and initiating small talk avoiding people,anxiety3766,so if im diagnosed to have social anxiety will it affect my chance of getting a job,anxiety3767,social anxiety and severe anxiety have been part of my life for year im being treated for it i know ive accomplished a lot ive done thing most people wouldnt expect from me like working a job that make me a public figure and having to make presentation frequently when im passionate about something i will continue to work hard to get there im proud in that retrospect however i feel like a failure socially i moved away half way across the country for a new job last year the job unfortunately required working night and weekend it wa difficult for me to make friend for someone who already struggle with social anxiety there were even time when i felt  like i didnt fit in or felt awkward when it came to social outing i did make one friend but at time i felt like i  annoyed that person i have a tendency of being hyper independent and avoidant out of fear of the rejection so i just let that relationship fizzle right when i noticed some form of rejection thats literally the only person who i made friend with i had fellow coworkers but again it wa just difficult for me people noticed how quiet i wa and some made rude comment about me i eventually had a mental breakdown and had to take fmlai briefly dated a guy but that relationship left me feeling hurt and even worse rejection he pointed out my flaw saying he wa helping me by bringing it up but it wa still hurtful saying i had no self confidence amp how he think my body is unattractive it wa truly hurtful im still on the leave but i havent done much socially ive only gone on long walk mediated exercise and gone to therapy weekly i wa invited to different thing from coworkers but i didnt feel right going out while i wa on leave i didnt want to have to open up about my struggle to them now im feeling major fomo but not just that  i feel like a failure i havent formed a community or built strong close friendship im thinking about moving closer to home but i cant stop feeling like a failure ive still let my anxiety get the best of me and affect my experience here,anxiety3768,like seriously what the fuck i am always fucking stressed that im not fun enough to be around or that other people are bored  uncomfortable around my presence this feeling result in me getting super tense trying to think of thing to say and im pretty sure this tension is obvious to others which probably turn them off even more lmao what the fuck do i do how do i stop myself from just being a floating ghost why cant there be even one person that truly enjoys my presence,anxiety3769,i take everything straight to heart even a sudden change in tone from someone just make me instantly think negatively towards myself and somedays it affect me so much sometimes that im literally fighting back tear afterwards and never want to open my mouth to speak again,anxiety3770,hi i have two friend that i always play online game with and talk on discord pretty much every day im asked to join and i enjoy my time with them a they are my best friend and i care a lot of about them although i constantly am in fear of being judged and have a lot of anxiety for no reason i feel i dont engage in conversation a much a i should and lately ive been avoiding joining because i just cant get my self to talk to anyone i feel like my anxiety ha built up and my brain is forcing me to isolate my self and avoid everyone i want to get on and play game with them idk why i feel like this i dont want to disappoint my friend and make them think i dont care about but im just too nervous for no reason,anxiety3771,i am supposed to do a pitch for a grade tomorrow in my writing class but i want to skip iti have been having panic attack about this pitch for day now and it ha disrupted my daily functioning because it is all i can think about it isnt even written well and that is part of my issue it ha to be memorized and i cant remember anything for the life of me the thing is that if i go to class tomorrow there is a chance that i will not have to do the pitch until next class which mean i will have been able to watch a few people to get an idea of what to change however if i skip i definitely will have to do it when i get back and wont have heard anybody el but will have had time to work on it i dont know which is the better option,anxiety3772,i wa feeling slightly uncomfortable during class so during the lunch break i went to talk to my teacher about it and i wa fine then when i went to talk to them my voice shook wa quiet and i said i have anxiety and i dont like talking during class is that okay and he smiled and said so you dont want me to talk to you during class he also tried to make a joke and said can i communicate with you through sign language which wa funny i guess but i didnt laugh and shook my head so i went back to sit down and started cry such a stupid reaction i wasnt even upset before that but i just felt so sad he came up to me and wa talking about how he wont put me on the spot and how he didnt believe anxiety wa a real thing until he saw grown men cry i said that i didnt know why i wa upset and he asked if anything else wa going on in my life and i said yes he said i could go home early i feel so humiliated by this im not a child anymore why do i act like this the class isnt even big but i still got overwhelmed by it i feel like a child i wonder why god if there is one cursed me with this horrible mental illness i dont know how i have survived up to this point with my emotional and mental health being how it is,anxiety3773,it absolutely mental these are the social situation i felt like i thrived in most i wa so good at connecting with people one on one and i preferred it so much more than group setting which i could find overstimulating now i can only be in group of  or more the second im left with one person i get tense and i overthink the conversation it just feel like too much pressure even the thought of taking the train with someone i know to go to an event stress me out the thought literally make me panic im only okay if im drunk ive tried propranolol lexapro and prozac none of them have really helped so far please give me any suggestion,anxiety3774,this isnt exactly involuntary maybe more of a habit after an awkward moment i almost always blink one eye and my head will twitch to the right even thinking about past awkward or overwhelming experience i will react the same way,anxiety3775,im so upset i havent had a haircut in  year and the one i finally get look terrible i already hate how i look which contributes a bit to sa and now it even worse idk what to do a beanie is probably the best option but idk if i like how i look w a beanie lol,anxiety3776,so over the past few year i have made a conceited effort to become more in tune with myself and confident ever since i wa in late high school i have struggled with social anxiety having been diagnosed young and it ha always been hard to socialize even with basic formality slowly at work ive come out of my shell and become more outgoing and genuinely bonding with co worker but the bump for me ha been at my college  i have no clue a to why but for some reason the past  year i have had this mental hurdle blocking me from interacting with people on campus there have been a few people that i have met that engage first and get me to chat a little but generally i just sat in a corner between my class and awkwardly waited this year im in a new program and their is a lot of people but i have to take the bus home for an hour each day there tends to be the same people all the time but even though i would like to chat with people sitting with me it always feel awkward so i havent gotten their yet  anyways today i wa sitting and i noticed this girl dropped her ear bud just before my stop while she wa sleeping idk if it wa me just knowing that i would be upset if i lost something like that but i waited till the stop and let a bunch of others get off first so i could approach her and tap her on the shoulder i told her where it wa and she asked where so i said the back right corner all the way in she said ok and then i got off the bus and just waited a moment to make sure she got it then walked away  i am so proud of myself that is the first time in year ive talked to a complete stranger and just have felt completely comfortable and not awkward the only downside is that one side of me feel like i wa being weird but i know thats not true because i wa just helping out another person hopefully though this allows me to grow more and i feel like this is a huge step on my journey thanks for listening,anxiety3777,so for starter im  and nonbinary afab and also autistic my parent had me diagnosed when i wa younger but they are for some reason still in denial about it i guess they dont want to seem like their family isnt normal anyways i struggle with communication skill and i have very sensitive sensory issue and one of the many thing i dont like is touchingi wa forced to show affection a a proper greeting when i wa younger now it viewed a disrespectful if you dont greet someone in my family with either a hug or kiss my only friend is also very affectionate and doesnt really grasp the idea that some people just dont like touching btw if youre just going to say to suck it up please leave thanks my family and my friend are very aware of my hatred for touch and how anxious it make me yet they still do it ive expressed before that it make me uncomfortable and yet they dont listen or respect my boundary i still live with my parent and they are constantly nagging at me for not giving them a better goodnight hug or whatever and although ive explained it many time it like a if my explanation fly over their head with my friend it almost like shes trying to change me shell do it even when i tell her not to and she wont stop the other day thing took a turn for the worst i dont have many outburst or meltdown so this wa something i and my family were surprised by basically i wa sitting on the couch with my mom and my friend should also mention that my friend is very close with my family my friend got upset because i refused to cuddle with her and my mom kept telling me to just do it that it wasnt a big deal i kept refusing and then before i knew it i wa being pinned down by my friend and she wa forcing herself on me and hugging me tight i felt like i couldnt breathe i kept yelling and telling her to get off she wouldnt of course i got upset so i kicked her hard and she fell off of me and i wa cry like hyperventilating i started yelling and basically just saying how im sick of the way they ignore my boundary and then i went to my room and im pretty sure my friend left after that and of course my mom scolded meits been a few week and guess what nothing ha changed they still continue to do it are there any other way i can express my boundary like at all i not only feel guilty for not being able to provide what they want but ive already been feeling like an outcast for being autistic in general in a more ableist  autism warrior family i know once i move out and i meet new people i can communicate it well but with my family and my friend it so hard because they just dont fucking listen and it really taking a toll on my mental health like badly,anxiety3778,so a couple hour ago i somehow accidentally posted a comment to the wrong subreddit  i wont get into any more detail but obviously people were confused by the randomness of my postno joke my face ha been red with embarrassment and anxiety for the last two hour i have a headache im struggling not to grit my teeth muscle are tense just feeling super anxious i hate that im wasting energy stressing over this  im old enough to know better but social anxiety ha managed to follow me for many yearsi think im going to read a book to get my mind off this  common sense tell me this is stupid to experience anxiety over random people on reddit but my emotion are in high gear right now  anxiety is such a disease i do take med for my anxiety but this week ive been struggling  thanks for listening,anxiety3779,i just wanted to share this is like the rd time but my teacher always requires activity to be done in group and it just make me wanna cry because of the pandemic and online class i basically dont know any of my classmate they already have their friend group and i tried talking to anyone but i cant our class alternate from online to facetoface the st time this happened i did the work for  people by myself the nd one i almost did work for  but after a week of stressing i somehow got the courage to dm one of my classmate to look for groupmates and i succeeded this time though idk why i cant my whole body get cold and i just want to cry ive always been a little bit socially anxious but after  year of the pandemic it became so much worse ill just have to do the work of  people by myself thanks for reading have a good day,anxiety3780,it gotten bad that i will deliberately make people dislike me so i can avoid interaction i feel like a dick,anxiety3781,assuming such a game existedview pollhttpswwwredditcompollzhvq,anxiety3782,i always awkwardly say nice to meet you too but it doesnt sound right lmao help a girl out,anxiety3783,removed,anxiety3784,it seems that every time i go to a concert or sporting event etc i always have an extreme fear of it even when i am with people i always think something bad is going to happen this definitely affect me more when going to small show at bar i frequent the smaller show because i personally find it to be a better experience and the band i enjoy only play small venue such a bar these cause me to have extreme anxiety when headed to the venue and even more waiting in line i think this is due to the fact the smaller show have little or no security for example one venue i frequent will do pat down but the other ha no security screening at all i constantly worry about the most terrible thing happening this all subsides after the first few minute of the opener playing however i think i just begin to lock into the music and it go away but the hour before the event make it very hard for me to go out to these showsmy question is what way can i overcome this fear prior to the show starting,anxiety3785,i downloaded this new gas app thats popular and it pretty fun if you dont know what it is look it up you have like five free hint where you could ask someone to join the app and get the first letter of someone name i wanted to see who said they liked me on a poll so i did that and the first letter wa the first letter of my crush name she also happened to be the only person i had with that letter i could have just asked her out then and there but i thought for a second that she might not like me any tip on how i should ask her out my social anxiety is making this simple task impossible,anxiety3786,ive officially learned my lesson to not leave my phone on do not disturb the regret i feel is beyond word rn,anxiety3787,im at a cafe near my university right now and everyone else here are people my age well ofc and i feel like im the only one not attractive enough to be here which is stupid because surely starbucks doesnt turn you away if your look dont fit in with their aesthetic and i just cant shake off the feeling that theyre all thinking how ugly i am or how weird my clothes are and why tf do they all seem fine am i the only one who think like this it so exhausting theyre all just minding their own business so why cant i mind my own why would i assume that theyll waste a minute of their time to spare me a glance sorry for the rant just wanted to get that off my chest and also maybe if i look busy and type on my phone they wouldnt see how anxious i am,anxiety3788,removed,anxiety3789,fyjdjjrixudie i think im gonna diee  i have to give a brief presentation completely in spanish tomorrow with no note card ive never done this before but i might try to go first so that i dont spend all of class

cant stay of them even tho i went through hell im just so done with this world i cant keep waking up and cry not even knwoing why most of the timei locked myself in my room doing ketamine and smoking weed and bingewatcing tvshows and gaming for almost a whole year a few year ago then i got help  year later i still do drug not a much but i still doand my mental health stayed the same maybe even got worsei have no clue what to to do and im fucking afraid for the future idont know how long il be able to take this shit anymore,anxiety3791,so i f recently got the courage to finally explain to a friend at school that i feel pretty lonely and left out at school bc people dont inviteinclude me in thing she basically just got pissed off at me and sent me a paragraph about how i cant blame anyone for the way i feel because it my fault that i dont talk to people and because of that other people at our school have told my friend that they think that i dont like them  and she ha a point but it because of my social anxiety that i dont talk to people at school not because i dont like them  but at this point ive been at my school for over a year and i feel awkward just now starting to really talk to people  and at this point everyone think im just quiet and weird and mean i guess also my school is quite small  i just dont know if i have a chance to even improve my situation at this school at this point i feel like it is just too far gone  im thinking of just leaving and going to community college next semester but im wondering if anyone here ha any advice,anxiety3792,i view anxiety a a form of intrusive thought i view intrusive thought a not my own not to be accepted i tell myself thats a lie any time i have a thought or feeling that doesnt make sense i refuse to accept the belief that social anxiety try to create it a simple a that every day these thought can become sneaky so you have to watch your mind closelythe song also talk about what it wa like at my lowest point when i became incredibly withdrawn and almost mute i am not hyper confident but in the year since it happened i have pulled myself out of it to the point that i feel almost normal i believe everybody ha the power to kick these thought out of their head it just take time i hope this help somebodyhttpsyoutubegiowrwyhs,anxiety3793,removed,anxiety3794,it a personal opinion but i will be honest with you if you dont agree it fine also my response might be quick or slow depending on the situation time  detail,anxiety3795,i like smoking and know a lot of people who say weed help lessen their anxiety but it make me so anxious in social situation and i find that once my body is relaxed from being high my mind over compensates anyone else,anxiety3796, being alone doesnt recharge me and doesnt feel a good a i once thought maybe ive just changed but now i really want to have deep close friendship but i literally cannot seem to bridge the gap between friend and close friend like there this feeling that i get talking with my brother or cousin that theyre just down for me and love me cant seem to feel this vibe with any friend i meet anymore i am a pretty awkward person so i could be mistaking this natural situational awkwardness a social anxiety i get unnecessarily stressed about how my friend view me not in the sense of being cool or something more like i just cant tell how much they care about me or even think about me sometimes i literally find myself in tear thinking about how im not that close with anyone the best therapy that ive used to get away from this intense social stress and panic of feeling of isolation is dancing by myselfthe only time i feel alive anymore is when im interacting and having conversation with my only decent friend right now or when im dancing by myself to hip hop lol i feel like im happier around people i care about and actually being with them and bonding with them recharges my energy and mood substantially i sound like a full blown extrovert saying these thing even tho my whole mf life ive seen myself a a relatively extreme introvertmaybe everyone feel this and im just a wu i dont know anymore,anxiety3797,do i have social anxiety from growing up in the citysuburbs why is that idk where it come from or why,anxiety3798,so i m enjoy playing valorant but nowadays im nervous about going on i always accept when someone sends me a friend request cuz im not tryna be rude but then they want to add me to their party hohoho i dont think yall want this i assume they use mics and i dont enjoy talking i have a special knack at making any situation awkward and im insecure abt my voice i cant even escape these request by playing a game because then they message me asking why i dont join which pop up in game and it not like oh sorry socializing make me nervous is a good excuse and i feel like they have an expectation for me to be a good player which i am most definitely notanyway i got penalized for an hour because i accidentally joined a party while i wa in game and had to immediately exit val turn off my computer and walk outside from fear doe this happen to yall or am i just weird i know a lot of people anxiety disappears on game and i wish i could do that how can i avoid this should i just unfriend everyone and auto decline any friend request,anxiety3799,i have had adhd since i wa a kid and developed social anxiety due to school bullying one time a kid broke my arm during football practice so i wouldnt be able to play i tend to bottle up all my emotion sometimes that bottle would overfill and when that happens i would close everyone and everything out one time i had my sister on the other side of the door begging me to tell her whats wrong but i just started cry so much more i wouldnt come out i couldnt but i would only let out enough to seal it again because im scared of whats in that bottle in fact terrified of the thought of it opening but i want to change and accept my feeling so i can talk to my family with emotion but it not that simple whenever im center of attention i start to studder and blush to the point when it unbearably uncomfortable i want to connect with them but i feel like an outsider to them i know they love me but i cant talk longer than five minute even in serious conversation i zone out and when asked i just say yeah because it all i know i dont know how to take control doe anyone have any tip thanks in advance,anxiety3800,theyre not wrong i shouldnt need alcohol to have fun or interact with people but i do if im at a party or club or bar sober  of the time i just stand there hoping someone will come up to me and start a conversation or if i went out with people i follow them around like a lost puppy the  of time i actually make an effort it usually by complimenting another girl outfit and hoping it can turn into a conversation which doesnt always work once im actually drunk though i dont give a shit ill talk to anyone about anything ill go up to a random group of dude and ask who want to take a shot with me i feel so free overthinking and racing thought are rare when im drunk i also make bad decision sometimes i black out and i often feel like shit in the morning but i never regret it it worth it for the couple hour i get to feel free from my anxietyi have to be feeling the alcohol though so at least  drink many people will say this is unhealthy or that they dont want to hang out with people that need to drink at every outing but i have not found a better solution to my social anxiety weed make it x worse for me besides im sure people enjoy my presence more when i participate socially and im not so awkward im not encouraging drinking or saying this is the solution for everyone i just wanted to rant because sometimes i feel weird for needing to drink to feel comfortable,anxiety3801,ive suffered from social anxiety disorder since i wa a little kid and holy crap im so tired of people not recognizing it a a debilitating mental illness to have ive had virtually no social life until one new friend ive made recently which can be blamed on my social anxiety disorder it not just being shy it so much more than that i feel physically sick everytime i have to text somebody that isnt a family member i get nervous with eye contact i can still do it ill just feel weird the whole time i cant approach people and start a conversation im terrified to speak up to the point where i wa almost mute for all of middle school this is a mental disorder it more than just being shy,anxiety3802,we had a meeting today on team because the startup i work at is merging with a bigger company and we all had to introduce ourselves my heart wa pounding so bad a my turn approached and when it did i swear i almost passed out i tried my best to talk about myself and what my role in the company wa but i feel like i sounded so damn stupid and weird i wa trailing off on my duty but luckily my bos came in at the last moment and saved me gah i feel like a worthless sack of crap why the hell am i like this please help me,anxiety3803,not really sure if i should put this here but im gonna anyways so ive had some pretty typical social interaction a a sensitive psych major  year old i think im mostly capable of social interaction ive been out with friend but nothing ha really clicked i guess and part of me feel like i should feel bad that nothing clicked a if i wasnt trying hard enough to like someone company or something so because of that for the past few year ive dedicated a lot of time to online discord group in that time the same sort of thing have been happening something doe click i get clingy i apologize but from then on it just awkward and we sorta just dip if it not that then it just a matter of my interest to a group still i had a lot of fun just month at a time howevernow i find myself at a low no group but instead of bumbling across some group again i thought i should talk about it somewhat publicly so here i am not sure what to do not sure if i should let fate continue to shove me into some other short time gig or of i should just be an actual pilgrim and yeah im anxious to try n meet new people im anxious about my own interest and also i kinda shut off when people tell me about their interest most of the time so like whats up with that lolanyways my life is going in an ok direction too i think ill be transferring to a university soon im good on money im doing volunteer work related to my career i have a part time job i take care of my mom and overall i think im pretty typical it just something in me isnt happy like it wa before when i could just shut the world off now it like i feel this need and guilt to hang out with my sister more call my dad more force myself to like people it all strange and it all stiff i never wa anxious about before me and my sister are on good term it just we dont have much in common or care to find out my dad mostly out if my life but he try ig and i have this one friend who been askin me out to place but like idk why i cant get excited over it idk it a confusingi hope any of this made sense i guess in just venting more than anything and ill probably be fine in a few week bye bye,anxiety3804,so for context im a  year old male and im really shy i fucked my first year of school because of it i have social anxiety and i have le than zero self esteemtwo year ago i wa depressed did some sh isolated myself from everyone this type of shit throughout that year the only thing that brought me happiness wa a girl at school which wa seated next to me and to whom i talked everyday i started feeling a little better a the school year went on and the summer came along i pretty much lost all contact with that person with the summer vacation and when the school year restarted i wa too shy to talk to her again her mere presence stressed me the year went on i made some friend started feeling a little better depending on the day after the winter vacation my friend started to talk to me about that girl from before and how she ha a crush on since like forever and shit like that time went on and they kept bringing her up when we talked making me even more shy when i saw her then summer came and i started going to party while drunk i felt a lot better and could talk to other people like i never could before eventually i talked to her and she added me on snap and shit this wa kinda of a quick summary bringing u to today where i talk to her on snap and hang out with her whilst drunk however i am unable to talk to her at school or when im sober since we talk a lot on snap i can pretty much confirm that she like me for real except shes shy just like me and we cant talk irl so we went from talking everyday to not being able to look at each other she showed me video of her last year where she said she missed talking to me a lot and that it wa the only thing that made her truly happy there are also some other stuff that happened to confirm my suspicion but i wont linger on the detailsso now here we are i think i have developed feeling for her even tho i am unsure she promised me that when well be able to talk irl shed tell me something important however i am unable to muster the courage to talk to her i feel pathetic im afraid im miss interpreting everything im scared of her judging me of people finding me weird trying to talk to her i also recently learned that the summer after the year we talked a lot she got drunk at a party and kissed multiple guy and i feel hurt since she supposedly had a crush on me at that point i also feel bad my heart hurt whenever i see her talking to other guy should i really be feeling that way everything stress me out im scared and idk what to doi dont know if this wa the right place to post this to so i might remove if i feel like it wasnt,anxiety3805,how would i approach someone to talk to them or even approach a girl i just feel like everytime i try to talk to

to the realization that ive become a stereotypical loser possibly even the archetypical loser it weird i always assumed to end up like that with no friend not liked by anyone getting bullied and outcasted that you would need to have something wrong with you yknow like that youd have to be actively weird or annoying or have zero self awareness or actually do gross or creepy thingsbut i dont i just try to blend in and not bother anyone but whenever i talk people can tell how nervous i am and instead of feeling any sympathy it seems most people are annoyed disgusted and just try to avoid mei dont get seriously bullied or harassed or anything but people will go out of their way to bother me for no reason other than seeing me a an outcast and taking pleasure in mocking me it not what they do that hurt it the fact that they have such little respect or consideration for mei dont know where i went wrong honestly i used to have some friend despite my sa but now it seems like im confined to outcast status and im discouraged,anxiety3825,httpswwwyoutubecomchanneluclkmuoxzppjukejeiwhttpswwwyoutubecomchanneluclkmuoxzppjukejeiw,anxiety3826,i f have had severe issue with social and general anxiety  desperation since childhood it not something that just go away and im medicated now which ha helped a lot with spiraling but the social aspect is trickier even with med my body is conditioned to react certain way to trigger a well a my brain not understanding how to fill in the gap between where i wa too afraid to tread before and what im capable of now with medication it constant mental and emotional labor keeping up with it and being kind to myself something that really helped me even before i started med wa analyzing my selfperception anxiety come from truth you convinced yourself are real when theyre not and separating what youre putting on yourself v who you really are can help make space for you to question those unhealthy fauxtruthsim not a character in someone el play i always saw myself a such tho every interaction im watching myself from a birdseye view analyzing action in my head that i cannot actually see i wasnt fully present in any interaction and a a result my brain would run wild projecting onto anything and everything i started allowing myself to have a versatile personality look at yourself and say im capable of being charming im capable of being sad kind sexy and angry im more than my fear and the anxiety thats just one small part of me and really feel it buy yourself sexy underwear write a mean letter to someone who wronged you and erase itwatch something that make you laugh while drinking winejust enjoy your own company and if youre capable of enjoying time alone why wouldnt someone else enjoy time with you too it obviously not meant to cure anxiety this is more of a mantra that ha helped me feel more emotionally anchored and le like im drowning in my anxiety obviously everyones differentbut a someone with hereditary anxiety issue i think

debate a our elective class together we both have given impassioned speech on our disabilitiesi have adhd while they have social anxiety theyre the quiet reserved introvert type of person recently they initiated flirting and weve been doing it back and forth eg calling each other hot admitting the other person is making u blush etc we also had an app called gas where you can vote someone anonymously on poll such a planning to ask them out soon down to date them or i think they may have their eye on me and they voted me in all of those flirty poll i wa confident it wa them since the notification revealed your grade and they were the only junior i wa friend with on the app i couldnt read if it wa platonic or romantic but it wa pretty weird if it wa platonic because we hardly knew each other i only platonically flirt with my super close friendsi decided to shoot my shot anyway by asking them to go out with me giving them two option a become my winter formal date or b have a picnic with me on thanksgiving break although they initially said yes to a in person they texted me asking for more time to think about it later on when we went home a it happened really fast and they wanted to take thing slow it been four day and i still havent received a clear answer regarding the proposal a few day later they said theyd want to get to know me a a friend first and then maybe it could develop into something more later since ive communicated that my intention in asking them out wa to get to know them and not to jump into a relationship i wa okay with this i wa just concerned if thats considered a leading me on im going to manage my expectation regardlessalso they dont match the energy they have in text when it come to in person i always sat next to them in class they ignored me unless i talked to them first it felt like i wa the only one making the effort to get close to them even though they mentioned they wanted to get to know me better platonically first yesterday i asked them to hang out a friend because it wa difficult building a closer friendship when we only have one class together i wa left on delivered is it their social anxiety or are they

without issue im always relieved when one or more of them cancel because the le people there are the easier it is to deal with last time i had an anxiety attack when we were together i ran away and the  of them went after me it wa too much and only made me feel worse theyre great friend but i dont know how to handle interacting with so many people but at the same time im afraid ill drive them away if i tell any of them how i feel,anxiety3864,i feel like my social skill are so bad people dont even want to be around me like i can just sense it especially at work if i walk into the back room theyll soon after go out of the room somewhere else and talk with another coworker what sting even more is seeing a coworker who newer than me get along with everyone else ten time better i know it obviously something wrong with me whenever im around them it like i cant stop moving around either like ill start cracking every bone and stretching randomly or pretend to fix my shoe like i cant just stand still and chill out or ill constantly pull out my phone and then put it back i probably look nut at time i feel like it so obvious im nervous ive been there  month so obviously this exposure shit doesnt work so now what strangely enough i feel more comfortable talking to customer than co worker and im not nervous about that it just dealing with those awkward silence with coworkers i hate being asked what i did last weekend or stuff like that cause it always the same answer nothing much which is the truth really and it suck cause they probably think im the most boring person ever i have zero friend too and honestly i do t know how im supposed to make them it hard to make friend a someone who ha none cause lot of people find it weird and think oh well whats wrong with her theni just feel hopeless im  and there  year old who i work with who appear more like adult simply cause they have better social skill it humiliating,anxiety3865,i know this is a really bad choice to post about this but i feel the need to say thisa while ago i made a post about having once attempted suicide once after year of social anxiety basically venting about my feeling of guilt i deleted the postsome comment i received i appreciated to clarify im not quite angry at those who tried to give me constructive criticism for lack of a better wordrather there is something that i really want to say to few who told me that my post show that i did it for attentiona few of the comment i received were very rude and patronizing intentional or not it seems that these people have really misinterpreted my post due to the way i worded the title thinking that i attempted suicide in order to make friend this is not the case many people in addition seemed to believe that my supposed suicide attempt wa recent which is also not the case it wa several year agoif you were venting to someone about feeling guilty saying that you made a mistake and did something for attention a long time ago show remorse and still think about it the last thing you want to be told is have you considered that maybe doing x wont make people want to be friend with you the detail you provided really show that you did this for attentionsuch comment told me information that i already knew under the assumption that i am not selfaware of the consequence of my actionsreading these type of comment wa very upsetting in my frustration i replied to these comment trying to justify myself my anger showed and i wa downvoted for not acknowledging other aspect of the comment i later apologized for my anger however looking back there no reason to apologize for something like this what i shouldnt have done wa post a very personal topic on redditi hope i made my intention of this post clear,anxiety3866,with what money i have sa which prevents me from getting job even though i am educated i am only passable in interview after a lot of prep and have no connection i dont want to run up credit card debt to get therapy and end up with a whole new anxiety problem over the inability to pay my monthly bill this advice is just annoying id love professional help are you telling me youll pay for it or that it free somewhere and im talking about legit therapy that can help someone with extreme sad  ive done the talking kind for over a year and it isnt going to fix this type of problemi want to get better i want to be productive member of society heck besides the social part of job i love working the truth is the usa and many other country do nothing to help people with disabling mental illness basically the message is find some magic way to get better on your own dont resort to killing yourself despite the bleak outlook of your life and your daily suffering because hey thats selfish just muscle through something you are incapable of controlling and maybe just maybe youll be able to save enough to take a shot at a certain type of therapy that could work youll just have to live in a constant state of anxiety and dissociate all the time after coming home from your shitty lowwage job but it ok  our system is set up so you literally cannot get healthy before seeking employment and you cant obtain an even semidecent job because you arent healthy good luck,anxiety3867,i remember one of my uncle would constantly always make fun of me for being a loner and joke about my sad i wa in middlehigh school when he would say stuff it wa always at party one time he also said i wa gay for listening to a certain artist i always wondered if my mom heard or just thought

propranolol for me to take everyday i told him i have sad and gad he said the buspar is for generalized everyday anxiety he mentioned that the propranolol may cause my blood pressure to drop down too low however i am struggling to understand why i need two medication for basically the same underlying condition especially if the propranolol wa already working for me when i wa only taking that by itself with no issue i would like to continue to only take that because the buspar isnt doing much for me i have been on and off with propranolol though so maybe there is something i am missing my question is doe anyone here take propranolol on a daily basis is it safe to take in that manner ha it caused negative side effect i am just trying to understand if whether the issue is with propranolol that i need to be on an extra med or if my doctor is just overprescribing,anxiety3877,i wa pretty much an alcoholic for a few month drinking to school work and basically every time i

,anxiety3885,removed,anxiety3886,i feel like im a very sociable person and i get along with people really well i would say im very extroverted and i really enjoy talking joking and generally interacting with people when im in school i dont really ever have any issue conversating with anybody i feel like a lot of people know me and im never really short on anything to talk about i dont really like to have an ego but people have told me that im apparently really funny which it make all the more confusing to me for a to why nobody ever seems to want to have anything to do with me once school is out once im home and people have free time i never get any message nobody ever invite me to do anything with them nobody treat me like im in their circle this past summer none of my friend ever invited me to go anywhere with them but id always see them posting about all this stuff they did with their friend on social medium even during the year i cant recall a single instance in which i wa ever invited to do anything with my friend unless i wa physically in their presence when they were inviting everyone even then this one time a girl wa inviting our friend group to go have dinner with her and i literally had to say out loud something to my other friend like damn can you believe girl name would really invite everyone except me lol just to get her to invite me to eat dinner because she wa literally inviting everyone in front of her except me despite being a senior in high school ive never had a girlfriend and it probably help considering that none of my friend especially none of my female friend ever want to text or call or facetime me for any other reason other than for something extremely practical like homework answer or something like that there this one girl im really interested in and even though i feel like we hit it off really well in school she barely ever text me how am i supposed to ask her to hang out or meet up after school if she never even speaks to me after school in the first place im not in anybodys friendcircle group chat and i always feel left out once when it wa spirit week the people in my friend group were all taking photo of each other in their outfit and they intentionally left me out and made me take all the photo like could you seriously imagine how embarrassing that wa for me i just dont get it people seem to like me at school what change when they get home people have told me that i should ask them to hang out but im scared theyll think im desperate that theyll respond with something like oh i cant believe my name invited me to hang out like he really think im his friend or something like that im worried that nobody actually want me in their friend group and just put up with me at school i just dont understand what more i can do,anxiety3887,my therapist told me i sometimes mumble people tell me a well that it hard to understand me i dont really hear it unless i am really quiet or they ask me to clarify a lot of these any help what can i do honestly dont even know if it nervousness probably or just how i talk,anxiety3888,ive come to this conclusion through bitter experience im an introvert and it hard to make friend but im always on the look out to make some  sadly i havent been a selective a i should have been in the past and a im a big empath ive mistakingly made friend who are not empathic at all or very little  this result in my getting my feeling hurt and the friendship turn sour in the end  i wish thee wa a test like the one in bladerunner ie what would you do if you saw a turtle lying on it back that i could weave into a conversation with a potential new friend just to test their empathy level,anxiety3889,it crazy how having no friend make it even harder to make friend i have a conversation with someone and there nothing to connect over none of the music they mention none of the concert they went to i dont know what shoe or clothes are trending or best no clue where the next party is heck i dont even know anyone on my college basketball and football teamsa guy once asked me where on campus he can get the best this drug i didnt even know what it wa  he used some slang this girl i met at work asked me what are good spot to eat in town and i froze and played it offi could write a list of thing i feel like im missing out on and do them alone or learn about them but what would be the point i know people complain about peer pressure but here this whole other side of growing up i feel like im missing  right now it probably too late,anxiety3890,hi everybody im a f and i struggle with depressionanxiety and am in the process of being diagnosed with cf i have been seeing a mental health support worker for two year now and this is my rd one the first one wa super lovely however she moved away due to getting another job the second onewell thats another story but it pretty similar to my current support worker let call my current one s and ill try explain below in bullet point whats going on ive been seeing her for a little over a year now it hard bc i feel like she care about me but she show it in the wrong way and it come across a more of a friend vibe rather than a supportive mental health worker vibe but i get into this i will just mention this but it not confirmed i feel like she almost ha some kind of intellectual disability i know she suffers from schizophrenia or something similar however she can be quite childlike at time and say the strangest thing  shes told me about other client she ha  their name and whats going on with them eg a hoarder and what the state of their house is like shes also told me about a client who committed suicide after s found her slashing her wrist i felt sick after she told me this and it honestly made me feel really upset  she keep touching my handshugging me when it clear from my body language i do not want this when she get here every time i open the door to let her in and she hug me which i hate i have started to stand back once i open the door but she doesnt seem to realise how uncomfortable i am and just hug me anyway when we are sitting at the table and im talking about something she will often hold my handsqueeze it if it on the table i have started keeping my hand in my sleeve or fiddling with my water bottle or something on the table but she doesnt seem to notice and still doe it anyway last time she did it i said to say it made you feel uncomfortable when she doe that but she either didnt hear me or didnt want to because just talked over me and it made me very angry i hate it when people touch me like this and every time she doe im mentally freeze up and cringing inside and just associate until she either let go or i pull away because i hate it so much  she turn up early with no warning we meet at  pm every monday there been several incident where she ha turned up at  or  with no warning except a text while she is parked in my driveway im often still in the shower when she doe this and it stress me out greatly once she simply texted me saying she turned up early so we could spend more time together it give off weird friend vibe and i hate it she tell me about her personal life such a her rent going up her weight loss whats going on her family etc it really annoys me a she will obviously turn the conversation towards her shell say something like oh it seems like both of u have had a lot going on and then go on about her life she seems to have no backbone and sometimes forget im actually an adult i have a complicated relationship with my mother who is my neighbour i also rent the property from my parent that i live in in the past my mother ha called s and even turned up in the middle of our meeting and s ha been like a dead fish in regard to telling my mother to leave a ive been so upset cry  her workplace kindly give each client a christmas present she ha asked me multiple time what i would like and i have said i would like supermarketgas voucher a they are thing i actually need she suggested a  lunch boat cruise for the two of u which not only is completely something unnecessary i do not want it is also something i would be doing with her which i do not want  she randomly will whip out her phone and show me a good deed shes done lately or play a song and sing i wa talking about how i want to eventually buy a tiny house one day and she got it in her head that it would be a good idea for her to buy one for herself she kept trying to take my phone to look at the one i wa showing her online i hated that she wa doing that and in my personal space so i sent her the link so she wouldnt have to keep doing it but it just made me very uncomfortable  she ha told me thing about her personal life that i do not think i should be aware of  i understand transparency and being open is important for someone in her job however i felt quite uncomfortable when she informed me that she wa hospitalised year ago for trying to rob a bank with a banana i feel like she is wanting me to give her advice when she talk about her personal life which annoys me a she should be the one supporting me she will make comment about how shes feeling overwhelmed at her bos is being a jerk lately or something like that and i feel like im expected to say something back thats helpful but im often at a loss because im dealing with my own drama in life overall i have had issue with her workplace a a whole i wont make this too long but with my last support worker she would turn up unannounced at my house and also i said i wa not message cooperating when i didnt reply to her during work hour because i wa at work long story short that support worker ended up getting asked to leave on the day that s ha been away sick in the past another support worker will sometimes call or text me to see if i want to see them instead a few month ago a relief support worker called my mother and asked her how she wa doing and apparently they had an indepth conversation which they had no right to be having a i am a fully capable adult i wa furious when my mother told me a it complicated our relationship she wa saying stuff like how the support worker wa supporting her for dealing with me which made absolutely no sense i ended up calling the workplace and speaking to the bos and told it wa completely unacceptable to which she agreed i had asked for my family to be removed from my contact number on my file and it not been done at the time which very much infuriated mei have thought about reporting s to her workplace  my sister and my friend who ive spoken to both agree that she ha been completely unprofessional however i would feel bad if i reported her because she obviously care about me however the way she go about it is completely unprofessional i also dont think i want to stop seeing her is a much of a hindrance these thing can be i like the fact i can talk to her about whats going on with my family what im struggling with lately without any bias however i always am exhausted when she leaf because i feel so guarded and irritated by her crossing boundary her workplace ha also mentioned discharging me several time in the past due to them having a lot waitlisted however without s i would have no professional support at all so i guess you could say i am at a loss for what to do i am seeing her later today and i am feeling quite anxious about it in regard to her touching my hand especially i would greatly appreciate any advice or suggestion thanks in advance ,anxiety3891,so not sure if this is

friend but i have failed again i  tried to join in a conversation multiple time with people who seem to be nice but every time i am just standing there awkwardly not knowing what to do i ha been a

you see softcore bully winning in life how to deal with this people when you are working closely with themi am a business major  senior i have not directly experienced any bullying in my college life but i can feel that some people will just unecessarily disrespect and be mean to other people and these people also pretend that they are extremely competent they have a lot of friend a well and some of their friend are nice people so i can never figure out how these people are friend in the first placethey dont seem unconfident or insecure about anything i have tried to think about it like this maybe they have some internal issue that they are dealing with  but no these people group others in a category and befriend them according to their social capital they are also sometimes awfully mean to people who have no friend but they will never be considered a bully by people from the outside looking in they are not bigotted in any waythey are very dismissive and unkind in general they are hardcore capitalist given we are at a business school most people are judged based on their capability if you are very capable people will suck up to youthey can push anyone under the bus for their own gain i know there will be people like that everywhere i have to work with these people in the future a well thats life but how do you not internalize this in a world where these people are going place and becoming successfully using their people skillssorry for the huge rant,anxiety3908,here the situation our pipe burst i looked up what to do right on the internet cause where else but i

must be very visible or else they wouldnt let you stay inside if you just have a headache or stomachache it wasnt this way when class first started but this policy ha been thrown at u a month or so ago and it a nightmare for people like me i have no close friend to hangout with during the break which ha resulted in me roaming around the playground all alone which make me feel like dying right

i truly do not want to come across are the one i frequently pas through the same day it extremely awkward and embarrassing for me but i have no other way and lately ive been getting more and more anxious because of it a i hate people staring at me which ha resulted in me not being able to move at all i come down and stay in the same position for the entire  minute while people just stare at me i try to look like i give zero fuck when im practically dying inside i tried locking myself in the bathroom during the whole  minute but it honestly suffocating there i used to roam around the primary child area but my classmate end up there also and our principal ha made a new rule which prohibits u from entering there a we could hurt the child ive been thinking lately why doesnt anyone approach me i expect a lot when im making zero effort but my anxiety hold me down everytime i try to interact with someone i just wish someone would come and take my hand and ask me to become friend with them

by making small talk and joke despite the small flaw it ha been going well anyways minute before the game start this girl let call her b start shouting at me and giving me order for no reason i didnt do anything to provoke her and i never even talked to her until now although i know she is in some of my class she is very rude and very bossy she obviously think i am dumb because of my quietness and disability i wanted to say something back and ask why are you being so rude whats your problem with me can you be more polite but i didnt say anything because i had a stuttering problem during the final round i lost because of b she chose me a her victim and decided to go for me and see me lose in the most humiliating way possible just because she obviously didnt like me and knew a nerd like me

more than  or so people i get very shaky nauseous clamy and i want to know if this would be social anxiety or possibly something else i am a  year old guy and always played sport growing up and never had any crazy issue being on a hockey team while at game or practice a i played longer we got to more team event outside of game and practice and i wa always incredibly uncomfortable being at those party and event so i would make up excuse to not go about a year ago i wa at a party for my team and while everyone wa getting fairly drunk having beer and going outside for a cheer to the new season and a big photo i noticed everyone had gone outside and i wa alone inside so i walked out the front door and speed walked back to my dorm room where i proceeded to have a panic or anxiety attack and sit on the floor and just cry for about  minute fast forward to today i wa at my girlfriend birthday party and we were all at her house and i wa doing pretty good for the amount of people that were there but then they started to say they all wanted to go to campus and go to another party there and i proceeded to get more and more anxiety ridden to the point where i wa shaking like shivering a if i wa cold but i wasnt my hand were getting super clamy and i started to feel incredibly nauseous is this social anxiety or would this be something else going on ive never seen or talked to a therapist or been diagnosed with anything but these kind of heavy social situation with more than say  people really make me uneasy and i dont want to keep feeling this way any help or comment are much appreciated,anxiety3969,i have zero friend and i cant make any at all genuinely hate myself so much for not being to interact normally with anyone it suck so much seeing people just talk with each

cant just talk to people life incredibly lonley i got no one in my real life and i cant seem to do anything to make it better no matter how hard i try,anxiety3970,the thing that terrifies me the most about calling stranger is calling stranger whom i need to come to my house fix something and then potentially rip me off because of how meek i am  i called a plumber today because our kitchen tap wa leaking my late dad wouldve either fixed the tap himself or called multiple place to find a cheaper quote but me being the way i am will never be the competent and calm person like my dad ever wa in the end the plumber suggested that i replace the tap and spout with a mixer and im frantically asking reddit if ive been ripped off luckily it seems like the price wa reasonablehonestly though im a proud of myself for being able to even call up two different plumber and luck wa sort of on my side when i went with the second one since the first one wa not available and charged

tirelessly searched the internet for people i can relate to on this issue but have failed so i guess ill post about it myself my social anxiety manifest in a weird way that sometimes make me question

their life it just feel like i have a complete mental blockade half the time im reminding myself that i need to ask them question but my mind go blank and i cant think of anything the other half of the time i completely forget that thats how conversation work until afterwards then i realize i didnt ask anything and feel awful people must perceive me a incredibly self absorbed and half the time i have myself questioning if i actually am but i dont think i am i dont really want to talk about myself either but conversation usually end up about me because i just let other people guide the conversation i feel like such a wet blanket lmao i really dont know where this issue stem from i think the biggest source is people in my childhood getting mad at me for asking question it could also be that ive always been shy and never properly learned social skill because my parent were soft with me and didnt push me too hard on it idk it cause me so much anxiety though because it just heightens the feeling that everyone hate me and they probably do having a conversation with me must suck with my closest friend even i find myself not really asking them thing usually at that point in a friendship they just offer thing up and i learn about them that way i can talk about a subject forever with my close friend but when it come to asking direct personal question i am incapable an example today i talked to my dad on the phone he just got back from a month long europe trip but i didnt ask him about it for some reason it wasnt until the end of the conversation where the entire thing wa him asking me about my life when he in passing said yeah our trip wa great that i realized my dumbass hadnt asked about it anyways this wa long and babbling but i just want to see if anyone

opposite of any other way that try to use logic and language to remove anxiety the essence of his teatchings is to be in the moment and not think too much and you dont have to do anything to achieve this in fact trying make you not able to achieve iti use the broad word anxiety here and not social anxiety because the way alan watt teatches reduces anxiety whatever the cause might be and social anxiety is just anxiety related to social situationi will leave some book recommendation aswell a a link to a video i want you to watch i have to warn you that it kinda difficult to understand but at the same time not difficult at all so listen carefully and realize that you have arrivedvideo httpsyoutubewfvjuklbwvwbook  httpswwwgoodreadscombookshowthebookbook

work event party date etc i literally dont know any other way of being around people i sadly live alone and work alone and the only time i properly interact with others is when i am drunk i decided to get back into dating recently and met a guy initially wasnt expecting much but i wa absolutely blown away from our first date he is everything i have ever wanted from a partner  intelligent kind funny interesting gorgeous you name it our second date wa last night and i wa so nervous i drank far more than i usually would before meeting him like half a bottle of gin safe to say i blacked out and the entire night is gone from my memory the entire thing usually i would at the very least be able to remember small part but we were together for hour and i dont know what happened all i know is that i must have dragged him back to my place at some point because there are two wine glass sat out on my kitchen table and that is the only clue i have i am now riddled with extreme anxiety and dont know what the hell to do i dont know if the night went well or if i made an embarrassment of myself likely and i am so so scared i dont want to message him and admit i dont remember anything because then hell know my drinking secret but if i get the opportunity to see him again hell soon figure out that i dont remember anything from last night god i dont know what to do,anxiety4033,i hate this sht so much i wanna go home,anxiety4034,doe it work for you,anxiety4035,removed,anxiety4036,i swear i saw a post a while back about how having social anxiety can make you stupid it true how could i have so little awareness i normally wouldnt but this time i wa particularly nervous because i havent been out in a little while so basically what happened is i wa going to see a friend at an event where they were giving out food i wa just going to stop by say hi get some food and leave i didnt think there wa a line because it wa horizontal i thought people were just going in front to whatever food station they chose so i went and asked my friend for a certain thing it seemed a little weird and i heard some girl next to me whisper about cutting i thought she wa referring to someone else though so i couldnt even go like whoop i didnt realize this wa a line my bad i hope my friend realizes that i did it on accident that im not the type of person who is demanding or anything man this is stressing me out ive gotten really good lately at convincing myself that people dont hate me for stupid stuff hence why i actually have a friend like if im kind of quiet one day or if i say hi and my voice crack thats just normal people arent actually gonna judge me for that and it just me being irrational but what the hell do you do when youve actually done something wrong that actually make you look bad in the same vein my friend is also an international student and i keep saying stuff that i feel like is ignorant in hindsight not like racist stuff but stuff that clearly show ive never been out of the country i dont want to lose my friend or make them dislike me it so hard actually having a social life for once it le lonely but more complicated im all on my own out here,anxiety4037,social anxiety is all about shame the anxiety is secondary  the shame is the primary you are ashamed of yourself and how you are in the eye of other people discover what you are ashamed about and cant accept about yourself focus on selfacceptance and selflove the thing we cant accept about u self we uncounsciosly project onto other people the reality is that we cant read other people mind  that is imposible we can only experience ourselves when we are hiding from other people judgement of u it is because we think there is something wrong with u find out what you think is wrong with you and bring it into your consciousness accept it accept being a unperfect human with social anxiety symptom i personally love people who show social anxiety symptom and blush focus on building af healthy and stronger egoselfidentity make positive visualisation about yourself in the situation you feel anxiety and change the feeling in your visualisation i know it is easy for me to write all this i know what it is like to have cripling social anxiety i have had it for several year i still have it to some degree but now i dont try to get rid of it completely i see the healthy aspect of it to  social anxiety is a part of the way our mind is wired a social animal social anxiety is there to protect u from being expelled from the social group which would mean death when we lived in tribe a long ago it is a protective mechanism which try to help u  but actually cripple usi wrote that you should focus on selfacceptance and selflove but what is selflove for me selflove is

mind,anxiety4038,i got st place on my class and i dont know how the fuck it happened i barely give any effort for my school i will probably attract a lot of attention and im really worried about

side of the earth there no emotion over text i cant see your eye facial expression nothing it just dead lifeless writing appearing on the screen you cant tell what they are even feeling or thinking becauase you get absolutely no information from blank text a in eye contact facial expression the natural way people are used to figuring out how someone is thinking or feeling you have to be careful about who you can trust irl let alone someone in a discord server that can remain completely annonymous if they want to i really fucking hate it the only people i trust are close family because if we ever have a problem they cant just choose to block you and waste year of getting to know you and time spent with one another with people irl you can talk to them face to face to work thing out like actual fucking human being shouldthis isnt even coming from anywhere ive not recently fallen out with any online friend that have fueld this post it just me clearing my thought and how i feel about

live we agreed to see a neurologist receive appropriate therapy and if necessary see a psychiatrist for more professional assistance although i am afraid because i have never heard good thing about psychiatry treatment it overwhelms me to talk to people i blush feel dizzy and am on the verge of fainting when i speak with someone moreover i feel insecure about my face and teeth because i have a

occur for example i worry constantly about dying fainting losing it and so on however surprisingly i never faint i am aware and awake and this make it that much more painful there is nothing i hate more than anxiety everybody ha trauma and pain and sad story that keep them from being completely okay but not to the point of being unable to function like being brainless and too aware while i know

anymore a we used to when we were  we kinda drifted apart when i failed school while going through a long period of depression we now meet up once or twice a year at most and almost never text each other on social medium because i dont like texting or video chatting just not my thing she turned  and invited me to her birthday party which surprised me because we never did anything like that before she invited like  people including a few old class mate whom i dont like majority of them i dont even know i already told her i would be coming but now i am debating whether i should go or not the party start in like  hour i still am not out of my bed yet and i still dont have any present for her bc i dont even know what she like they also just want to get drunk but i dont really like to drink due to my alcoholic father and childhood trauma but thats for another story i also dont want to embarrass myself when they all ask me whats going on in my life right now because i am unemployed still job hunting and depressed in my room all day never going outside not even for taking out trash meanwhile they will probably brag about their perfect life studying at prestigious university and being in a cute relationship it all just very humiliating i feel like im being a bad friend by not coming to her party and generally not being a close with her a i think friend are supposed to be she know about my sa and is very understanding of it we both battle with our own mental illness but we are both in completely different world right now she seems to be peaking now studying at an amazing university ha a great job so many cool opportunity opened up for her and her future career she created so many new close and great friendship and generally is in a very happy place now meanwhile i am at one of my lowest point going through seasonal depression again being rejected by job left and right dealing with my gender identity loneliness and generally in a very miserable place right now i am not in the mood to socialise with people i dont talk to or even know at all my body shiver just thinking about socialising and even if i did i would just sit there in the corner all awkward and quiet i have absolutely no energy for anything and just want to stay in bed and watch reality show and musical i also feel bad because some of the people that she invited have already cancelled and texted her that in the group chat that she created for her party i feel like an absolute asshole if i also cancel now i dont know what to do,anxiety4090,i am going on my first ever date a long a the person doesnt reschedule like we did already once i feel super nervous almost sick anyone else here date with sa and how wa your first date,anxiety4091,im so sick of going through the same cycle wake up travel to uni alone sit in lecture on my own without speaking to anyone sit in the library on my own during break travel home i kid you not i spend nearly every single day entirely alone and entirely mute despite seeing people on my course for over a year now i havent made a connection with any of them i avoid interacting with them to any degree  no conversation no smiling no eye contact you get the idea because my social life ha been nonexistent for so long ive noticed a consistent dip in my mood now even when im at home with my family i cant find the energy to interact with them if im not already depressed ill get there soon im just so sick of it all,anxiety4092,i first noticed this during lockdown when i wa stuck with my cousin at their house at kne point i felt like i overstayed but didnt have an option to leave a well we used to smoke marijuana a lot during those day at one point i felt my cousin started throwing shade at me by making me listen to particular music my cousin used to call me a bitch since i wa young but i never felt much about it but at the peak of where i felt they were tired of me around he started playing kendrick lamar humble which ha a line bitch sit down be humble at first i didnt notice it but he kept playing that everyday again and again i felt at one point that he wa throwing a shade at me fast forward during a time where i felt deeply in love with a person and wa trying to get her to come to my place for the night we had an argument but i wa too attached to her and somehow convinced her to come to my place that night and while driving back she played hugo problem the lyric go like  if you having girl problem i feel bad for you son i got  problem but a bitch aint one she put this song on repeat i felt like she wa taking a dig at me for how clingy i wa behaving and thought she wa trying to show me that  see real men arent like this  twice when we had  a kind of argument she played me this rd time wa with my flatmate i had recently met with an accident and my mother came to stay with me for sometime one fine day while going to airport with him to drop another guy he started playing all rap song with lyric containing about dis to one mom and even when playing those song at particular point when those dis came he would increase the volume in a way to show emphasis that i should listen to the particular track not just with music my flatmate i felt like used to show particular video clip film to poke fun at me which would be very similar to the situation i wa in all of these people would act normally and not get into an argument but there passive aggressiveness through medium ha left me confused and paranoid while discovering how the act of consuming medium could also be used a an aggressive expression it isnt just these people i have noticed other people also doing the same thing if people are doing this wouldnt it mean that i am living in paranoid world where there is a cold war happening between people where they are using aggression through  whatever they do mostly that is consumption of medium,anxiety4093,last month in math class the teacher told all the student to stand up we are like  in the class

flowing in my body at all i wa definitely choking at that point then  people gave me their hand so i took them and they escorted me out of the class it felt like i wa getting dragged down because i couldnt stand properly all of this in front of everyone this wa literally the most embarrassing thing ever the more i think about it the more i feel stupid my whole goal is not to grab attention but

more there is always more but it so personal that i cant confess it even behind this veil of anonymity i am never going to be a part of a hangout sesh i will never let mei go to college currently doing my post graduation in counselling psychology a profession that solely depends on talking to stranger like a pro go figure what wa going through my head when i chose this path i had friend during my bachelor programme and theyd make plan after college everytime they asked me i would make an excuse that i had plan of my own when i did not after a point they stopped asking and that wa another type of hell theyd post picture of their fun evening and i always felt left out so after  year of hell i thought i wont repeat this behaviour over my post graduation period i took a fcking oathbut here i am making the same mistake again this is such a tightrope on one side there is crushing loneliness and on the other side there is absolute humiliation when did i become so dysfunctional god i have to go to therapy dont i that is yet another ordeal on it own,anxiety4099,today i had a google video meeting for a tech training program ive been handling phone interview ok the day before i wa in a state of anxiety severe ive only had one other video interview and it wa bad i decided to go to it anyways and i wa anxious but i got through it without having an anxiety attack i dont like being

think my mom heard me talking and wa eavesdropping but idc im pushing myself on my own for real id love to just get out of this environment and take trip and let go of trauma for once,anxiety4100, hi allas the title suggests my boyfriend of nearly three year is more extroverted with me and seems to thrive in the company of others he ha lot of friend from different group and he love going out drinking and can easily make friend with anyonei would say i am a bit of an ambivert  i am super chatty when i am with my friend and in smaller group and i would probably appear quite confident to those outside looking in however in larger group where everyone know everyone i find i struggle and mostly stay quite quiet which unfortunately mean i am often forgotten about i like my own space and would much rather stay in with close friend than go out and mingle with new people sometimesi make friend fairly easily because i am quite bubbly and outgoing  it is just when i am with people who are more stereotypically popular than i and i just get lost on what to say to them with the fear of sounding like a weirdoin the three year we have been dating none of my partner cousin have asked me out with them but regularly meet up and go out for drink and meal together and i think that is where the fear is stemming from i am going into friendship that have already been establishedmy partner family are holding a party for an auntie who i have met and really like she is turning  and a large number of family and friend are invited and i cant help but feel petrified about going it is his family and they are a fairly close family and girlfriend that are with the cousin and have been in the family much longer than i have will also be attending i feel they have more history and closeness to openly discus and converse with each other than i domy partner will go off and speak to his cousin  absolutely fine with that  but i sometimes cant help but feel lost when he go off and he often tell people that i take time to get out of my shell which annoys me a little a i am only quiet when i feel uncomfortableit seems so silly being nervous at a family party but i hate looking like an outsider or someone who is a bit of a loner a i know for a fact that i like other people company i just dont do that well when i am surrounded by people i do not know but they know each otheris there anything i can do to ease my worry i just dont want to look foolish or a total outsidertldr partner is chattier and make friend easily and we have a family get together to go to and i am going to be surrounded by people that have already became close and established friendship i do not want to appear like a loner or an outsider which is what is worrying me the most,anxiety4101,so im currently in therapy and maybe ill talk about this there too i recently started grad school and it relatively easy to do small talk i still get panicky sometimes  when a professor asks me something but i also get sad when i realise im lacking basic social skillsi constantly feel like im not liked by people and that get extremely sad and hopeless a few day ago i talked to someone we both had the same class afterwards and on our way she went into the bathroom and i stood there waiting and seriously didnt know if i should wait or not normally i wouldthe door opened when someone left the bathroom and we had awkward eye contact this reminded me of when i wa a kid had a hard time in school and someone wa asking me to stop following them  around i then decided it wa super awkward that i waited and leftwe dont really talk anymore and i strongly feel like shes not interest in being friend my depression is tied very closely to how social situation work out and one bad small  awkward mistake can make me spiral super sad and hopeless that ill never be normal i also feel lonely but then overwhelmed in social situationsany advice ,anxiety4102,it gonna be true until i

cone down and started to clean it i feel so bad about it i wanted to go apologise again and say i could help clean it but my anxiety stopped me so i just purchased my grocery and left without looking back because i felt embarrassed and i didnt know what to do or say other than apologisethis is just a rant,anxiety4106,a series of unfortunate event me forgetting we didnt have class in our first period today ha led me to chill for an hour at the school library the thing is some of my classmate are here and with that i mean all of the girl from my class only  girl sure but thats all of them our class is mostly dude which is a whole different issue to me but anyway a lot of them met in the beginning of this year and they are already studying together which mean theyre probably hanging out outside of school too im the only outcast the only one who doesnt talk i actually saw one of them hanging outside before and i wa confused on why she wa also here so i tried talking to her suffice to say the weirdest shit came out i swear to god i make no sense when i speak they probably think im retarded i honestly dont even care when im not in school but being here always make me feel so vulnerable next year im supposedly going off to college  andor getting a job but how am i supposed to do that,anxiety4107,im a college sophmore and got a random roommate for the first time and i think i made them think i hate them im really shy and never look at my roommate even though we are in the same room when i walk in i look down at the floor i also never talk to him this is really cold

really shy what should i do anything i just feel like ive been really rude,anxiety4108,i find my self talking complementing and being friendly with people i hardly know just to have a potential friend despite the fact that this socializing leaf me with social fatigue the whole day  when those people just dont bother to even say goodbye to you when the conversation end or just skip you when they find their friend  it seems that i am just not likeable and the social anxiety that ive been fighting for year is there for a reason maybe i am just weird or a sticky person who think people are enjoying having time with just embrassing myself i lately feel that i just need to sit alone and dont interact with anyone when it is just causing damage to me distracting me from thing i need to doquestioning my personality every time a conversation finish wa i selfcentered did i something bad am i fake am i dumb and pity is my personality that bad to the point people just tend to forget i exist the moment they see an exit am i obviously desperate for friend a i always meet people alone so many question that leave me sad and depressed all dayit is not worth trying anymore i will never find a new person who value me the way i will value them because i am simply not normal,anxiety4109,i once missed my stop on a bus because i wa so self conscious to get up from my seat and walk to

month i wa able to go try on and buy new clothes for myself sit alone in a coffeshop all on my own and do grocery shopping alone for the first time ever in my life i feel like my therapist feel like these are thing that i should already have been doing so she is not really appreciative of these thing which are  to me huge achievement she ha also told me to go to bigger shopping mall or join yoga class etc by myself to get rid of social anxiety dont get me wrong im not against trying any of these thing but i just feel like i need a little more time and encouragement to start doing them also the way shes kinda dismissive about the thing i do  her constant new advice reminded me of my excessively controlling and overbearing parent and triggered me to go into an emotional flashbacki am not plainning to find a new therapist bc frankly i dont think most of the therapist in my country are going to be super openminded when it come to topic like childhood abuse and trauma bc these thing are still somewhat of a stigma in my culture  she ha been of help in the past and i dont want to lose one of my few lifelinesif you were in my position would you try to push youself even harder to try new thing or would you try to keep doing thing on your own pace while still challenging yourself to go out there by doing some task that are relatively new to you until youre ready to go try the next big thing also do you think i need to find a new therapist bc i explained to her that i think shes being a little too fast wth her approach but she didnt really listen to me and kept doing her own thing,anxiety4113,tomorrow i have all day family and friend day outsaturday is the civil ceremony along with a reception number sunday im with people all day near to prepare for the mondaymonday is

anxious try to hide it when they try to manipulate you into liking themwhat ive seen one person tried to win anothers love by money giving gift but clearly having an agenda another case a person tried to get favour by saying i love you ill care for you many time but forgetting that after receiving said favour both were not conscious manipulator but highly anxious and didnt say true motivesit look disgusting and creepy people know they dont know what youre hiding or what you really want from them but they know youre dishonest it make them feel badlets rip the bandaid if people act like im disgusting thats because i am not my nature is bad but because i try to act fake normal and i try to manipulate them into liking me i didnt even realize it until i saw it from outsidei still feel like

me any tip for how to deal with these struggle you find useful would be greatly appreciatedi have always been terrified of other people scared shitless of their perception of me i dont mind talking to people and doing it in the moment from the outside it great but on the inside im analysisng every single thing i say and determining im actually really awful to talk to they despise me secretly or i have said something wrongpresentations are okay for me in an academic setting like if it something im being marked on however anything bigger than that and im quite scared although to be honest i dont think i struggle with this in particular too much im decently ok with public speaking at least when it come to school im unsure how i feel about themhowever there is one thing that make me doubt sad  a of recent though i am absolutely terrified of it i got a bit out of my comfort zone and decided to do this program where you partner up with people from other school im so scared for it but i think itll be good for me in some aspect trying to build confidence i suppose ill try my best all i can dowhat i struggle with most is the fear that people hate me or judge me im scared of sharing my own opinion terrified if what i say is wrong it painfulits confusing it like i talk to people but i constantly fear what i say i judge my every move i can for the most part do presentation but if it something like making a speech for something nonschool related im really scared although i suspect thats pretty normalpretty much the biggest thing is worrying if people hate me i cant have a conversation with someone without my mind freaking out over every single thing i sayconfrontation is terrifying i cant think of anything worse i really struggle with that and it ha a huge effect on my social lifealthough i feel this could be attributed to other thing i have autism adhd generalised anxiety and ocd so i think it may be a mix of both some of my ocd rumination many of which are social in nature self conciousness the fact im quite impulsive with what i say and element of generalised anxiety making me overthinki thought i would check here anyways though not just to see if my experience ring a bell but also to get some advice for way you like to deal with a fear of judgement social anxiety really ring a bell to me though at the same time i think it may be caused by other thing so im a bit stuck here any advice is appreciated thank you lt,anxiety4124,i have social anxiety and am shy and quiet but i think one of my colleague at work genuinely belief i am dumb and i am

medicine,anxiety4129,i post a bit too much here for a long i have been on this sub i always felt the urge to post whenever something relating to social anxiety wa bothering me like most people here i use this sub a an outlet not everyone here ha someone personal to confide withbut there wa one post that i made several month ago that still stick out to me which wa a vent about a traumatic moment ive experienced year ago that still affect me to this day namely i made the post expressing guilt and pentup anger about myself citing a specific situation i wont get into detail due to personally identifying informationafter looking through some of the comment i received i deleted the post a few hour later i felt worse sick to my stomach i regretted posting it in the first place and i asked myself what did you even want to achieve from posting one of your deepest trauma to redditwhile some comment were supportive reassuring and giving me advice about moving on i have stressed over the comment that completely missed the point of my postimagine venting to someone about your yearsold spentup guilt about a severe mistake you made in your life just to be regurgitated the same exact selfdepricating intrusive thought you have told yourself for age you decided to vent to get these thought out and seek reassurance and instead you were indirectly given reason for why you should feel so awful i felt sick my stomach maybe the title of my post wa misleading maybe i wasnt clear enough i replied to these comment a if i were saying no thats not what i meant but my message wa drowned out by my evident anger and wa downvoted this reinforces the idea that i always need to justify myself it exhausting to do that ironic considering what sub im onmy experience is not quite the main point of this posti am sure this sub is full of people like me who need an outlet a place with people to relate to unfortunately and obviously nobody really know each other this is still reddit this is still the internettake this post how you will i probably have a point i want to make but have no clue how i would articulate it in  a few concise sentence just dont lean too much on the internet for emotional support purpose,anxiety4130,ive had social anxiety since i wa around  year old even before i started to have social anxiety though and didnt care what people thought looking back i never really had any close friend and even though people somewhat liked me i used to be the one who put all the effort into my shortlived forgotten friendship i find myself still doing that now with the online friendship i have currently ever since th grade all throughout middle school and high school so far i have not made a single friend despite being in the same school district for  year im a sophomore in high school and while i might been friendly with some people in the past ive always somehow never really been enough for them no matter how much i tried some people would tell me it not that i dont like you it just that you dont talk much well then i tried forcing myself to talk more and sometimes id repeat myself over twice just to be left ignored or unheard i would willingly go out of my comfort zone to participate in extracurriculars one which i have genuinely enjoyed but even if i took risk to reach out and we talk we never reach past the acquaintance stage and again i end up forgotten it funny how i feel like people dont care about me yet i still have this extreme fear that theyre judging me i couldve sworn there wa a group of girl glaring at me at and whispering about me at some point and taking little step to be around other people and make myself feel exposed to others ha done nothing but make me feel even smaller in the end i think my social anxiety ha been getting worse rather than better i spend my lunch break doing homework in the library and even there i fear other people might be watching me and judging me for being alone i recently started new class with a heavier schedule and i already have several presentationsgroup assignment to worry about this week ive signed up for honor class not really realizing the amount of collaborative work and presenting i would need to do and i can never feel comfortable enough to tell my teacher or even my parent about my social anxiety because they would find a way to use it against me i feel like im going to end up miserable for the rest of my life it funny because i used to always think of myself a an optimistic person but now i realize that it doesnt matter how hard i try or what i do to change social anxiety will not go away will not become more manageable for some people like me i mean ive read some  of post on this sub and some adult have around  year old seem to still be stuck with this crippling fear of socialization it doesnt get better is what im quickly starting to believe each day my grade are going to take a toll because of my social anxiety my lack of motivation in creased because of my social anxiety i feel my entire future just going down the drain and sometimes all i want is for time to stop because everything is moving way too fast for me to be even capable of handling i have to worry about college soon the amount of stress school ha put on me with extracurriculars time management presentation group work loneliness i dont know how much im able to carry i dont even know where to go from here to be honest,anxiety4131,removed,anxiety4132,removed,anxiety4133, the deli counter at a grocery store i mean this ha to be one of the worst place on earth being in a grocery store with all the weird interaction is hard enough but the deli counter is a special panicinducing area the small talk the feeling of your order being judged by the small crowd around you the counter being a tad bit too high and you cannot hear the worker the pressure to pick from the one billion option etc tonight i wa in line and contemplated becoming vegetarian just to give myself an excuse not

passion and so i project this onto others i almost look for confirmation that people hate me i assume im worthless and unlovable so i imagine people must also perceive me that way now why do i care ive wondered the same but it is awfully hard to do anything when youre around people who you believe see you a a piece of shit weird part is this is the case even with people whove said they like me

proud and grateful to be able to do that there are still a lot of moment especially when talking with people whose opinion i care about a lot where my mind just go absolutely blank like i cant think of what to say or how to move the conversation forward and thats frustrating like even when i try i just cant talk it suck so much to know logically what you have to do to push yourself to take the

than it ever been im basically agoraphobic i have no friend my partner go to work and i stay home working on my class or looking at job that i wont be able to acceptwill ultimately be underqualified foras a result ive sought out remote work and an opportunity that initially seemed promising feel like it slipping away from me now a the recruiter examines my resume in more detail going from confidently believing i wa qualified to questioning gap in my resume and noticing i have essentially no professional experience the year go by and all i have to fall back on is a college degree so fucking what i went to high school and college i got a piece of paper im getting my master now what for i dont have the necessary job experience i wont go far with what i have ive wasted my s it all feel so bleak and hopeless the time that ive rejected opportunity are showing upi feel like i wont make it in life a world built for the confident the extroverted the physically and mentally able i wa recently rejected for disability benefit so that solidified that nothing is working for me im so fucking depressed ive been ready to end it all for quite some time now,anxiety4163,i feel like i dont really know how to socialize i am fixated on my every move and im always wondering how i know if someone like me if they do like me how do i know if they change their mind how can i just be and not care so much whether i get rejected i can be myself around my husband but im so afraid to fail with everyone else i imagine i need to just keep trying and failing ive always been someone who waited for someone else to reach out to me because then id know for sure that they liked me thats scary though too because they can change their mind i wish there wa a class where i could be critiqued on my social skill and someone could help me navigate this scary world of making friend,anxiety4164,i just want to be to stop feeling anxious whenever someone get near me i dont want to get a panic attack

coffeinewhat other supplement u guy can recommend me,anxiety4166,what do yall think about skipping graduation personally ive never really enjoyed my school and ive been thinking about skipping grad all together it a waste of money and for the most part it wa my parent feeling about this that kept me from thinking too deeply about it on top of that i only have  friend who i can think of passing the time with while im there but they have their own friend a well ive tried to make progress with sa for the past  year but ive been stuck in the same repetitive cycle that is feeling like ive finally beat it only to feel like absolute shit the following week and wanting to isolate myself from the rest of the world i dont do that a often anymore but considering grad is the only major upcoming event for me i dont think thing will change much by then so i guess what im asking is is anyone else graduating soon thinking the same thing,anxiety4167,removed,anxiety4168,removed,anxiety4169,context le than average looking guy here possibly near ugly classification been single for  year of my life i dont wanna spread negativity and all but hear me out so i started using dating apps like half a year back of course to no avail used like  platform total of zero match kept improving my profile still zero match eventually it kinda took a toll on my mental health and i decided to delete them i realised dating apps wa never an option for me because i am not even average attractive since dating apps is pretty much all about physical appearance for a match to even happen i realised it confirmed my suspicion of why i have been single  then i realised people say that personality could actually be more important than look to some while i lowkey call bullshit on that theory i did try but of course with my crippling social anxiety even me myself dont know whats my true personality like say le showing it to others it tough so recently i actually stepped out of my comfort zone and at least try to initiate contact with some woman i basically got ghosted by all even this girl who i wa talking to for awhile so i thought since exam were coming up why not i ask her out to study to at least get to know her better of course she rejected me in a polite way and i tried to just continue texting her but of course she hasnt replied me so i came to this conclusion for guy like me who near the ugly spectrum i will never be able to meet my potential so via online yet my only chance is at social event or maybe just irl where i may be able to overshadow my look with personality but with social anxiety it almost impossible to even have a personality to show say le of it being a extremely positive one so in this never ending cycle look really doe matter alot and i will most probably die alone thanks for reading note i am really not here to spread negativity i just want to voice my thought and release the anguish in my head,anxiety4170,what is even worse than just the normal sa of a certain situation right it is the combination of sa and the immense fear of a dentist appointment making it via

week no matter how hard i try to distract myselfdo you guy have any trick to distract yourself i am scared i wont sleep tonight and then i have to go there like a zombiei mean i am not expecting a major thing to happen but i have to go in talk with the doc and then who know what they will do  it is just the entire thing that keep replaying my head ugh,anxiety4171,friendless lonely never spoken to because im awkward i sit through class frozen and picking at my skin till i bleed because of anxiety it is a way to cope with these spiraling thought of trauma from feelingbeing judged and i go about my school day sitting alone using my phone and never looking up because im scared of people and because im not a fucking normal human im agoraphobic have social anxiety and selective mutism but this is most about my anxiety i cant do anything around people without feeling judged or stared at i feel like a burden everytime i walk into school amp class or even around people simply i can

my struggle she wont really acknowledge them because i feel like she dont like victimist mentality idk i think im the problem i waste her time also i think i have cptds and avoidant personality disorder but when i told her about avdp she said that it doesnt seem like it and she diagnosed me only whit social anxiety but im  sure that is not only that just because i look fine doesnt mean that i am i just hide it very well unfortunately honestly i hate my self im in therapy for  year now i didnt improve and cant even tell her this,anxiety4191,i want to be more genuine with my issue but feel like shit about what i put on others especially some way to explain to people why i might have to decline social activity without having negative intentionsdo you guy have any experience opening up with people in different setting and how did it work outmaybe the consequence weigh heavier than the reward but it feel like shit having to be so fake,anxiety4192,i noticed that with every important interaction i have no matter how great it felt in the moment ill end up ruining it and spinning it into something negative in the hour that follow just from overthinking it to death ill start questioning if i wa rude if the other person hate me if i really said what i remember saying or if im remembering wrong etcits exhausting im guessing this is a pretty universal experience among those with social anxiety,anxiety4193,httpsyoutubepgbyaavcu,anxiety4194,previously  my sad wa so bad that i couldnt physically speak out loud  my throat would close up and id have dry mouth  and if i spoke it wa so low and mousy and just a few word  but now  i dont know if  it progress or just my depression numbing me but i can talk with others and my nervousness come in not knowing what to say  especially to people who intimidate me   for example  i would want to say  you could find this shirt in that store  but instead say  it could see how you will see it in there  you know    if you didnt understand thats what im talking about  it like my brain shuts down  it feel worse than not talking tbh  because when i wa quiet i atleast didnt embarrass myself by saying the weirdest stuff  and it not just in my head  people are usually nice but ive seen how awkward and over it they are when talking to me anyone went through this phase  please tell me it get better ,anxiety4195,i f have an appointment with a psychologist at the end of the month  im starting to get nervous and wanting to cancelive never been to a psychologist before and im afraid i wont be able to open up to themive always had trouble expressing my feeling   doe anyone know what i can expect to happen,anxiety4196,im going on a trip next week to see a friend who is currently studying abroad ill be staying for  day and im so anxious already thinking about being with his flatmate all day along im also so worried about the possibility of him wanting to introduce me to his friend or whatever and having to spend a whole night with people ive never met and will never meet again i know im not gonna have anything in common with his friend those people have superior study and i do not and im so insecure about it i havent had proper social meetups for a while and im so out of shape but i also dont want to tell my friend about all this because i dont wanna spoil his plan ahhh help im spiraling ,anxiety4197,i feel like nothing help  well i mean i am on medication right now mg zoloft and i sort of see result but my social anxiety still haunt me daily  it still very much so extreme this living shit is hard and shout out to all of u still here despite this treacherous illness,anxiety4198,im so embarrassed i wa on the phone and i just kept interrupting him and i got so mad at my self i really hate talking i just wanted to shut up but he would ask question and i got so scared and i just wouldnt say anything because i wa so nervous and i just say i need to go to sleep he so nice and i just cant control myself at all but he so nice and loving i just dont know what to do i feel so bad about making him apologize so much i wa trying so hard not to cry and he wa so sad and saying he wa sad that he made me cry but it wa just my stupid brain he never doe anything wrong i just want to hear his voice not mine,anxiety4199,ive gone through many presentation before but for some reason this one is making me more anxious than i usually already am i signed up this honor humanity class not knowing wed be doing a lot of collaborative work plus presentation just about every other week and i almost regret it i dont know people in my class very well the one i do know have kind of some bad judgment towards me because im known for being quiet somewhat awkward and im scared that some of my classmate will end up laughing at something i share about myself while im up there i feel like it easier to present when im in a group not by myself and definitely not talking about myself because i always get embarrassed about my interest even though i know people probably wont remember every single detail or even care about what i say that much i cant help but wonder if taking this class wa a mistake i couldve avoided this by taking regular english because ive never had issue there but instead i took the risk and now im not sure if ill be able to handle the extra presentation and group work with people who i feel like already hate me for some reason,anxiety4200,im just trying to see if this is a universal experience whenever i get a bad grade in a class having to go back to the class and see the teacher or professor get me more worked up then the actual grade just having to look the teacher in the eye after doing bad make me nervous im in college and had to do a group project that we made a not so good grade on even though i did my part im anxious to go to class this week and see them a well a my professor doe anyone else feel this way im seriously considering skipping class,anxiety4201,im super anxious because i overthought while answering to a text and then sent something really weird like word that do not fit the situation and may come off a offensive cause i wanted to make someone feel better so i wanted to make them laugh but looking back it didnt work at all i would have been bummed out if i wa the one receiving the the texting  if i just said my genuine first response it would have been more natural and me and not awkward and a more fitting and comforting response now im afraid the person will not tell me their inner feeling or will slowly stop cutting me off and stop contacting mei probably should have given myself more time and answered much later after thinking like other people do i also get this impulsive feeling i have to answer back at a timely moment and feel like a control freak dont read it too fast nor too late not to seem idle or desperate but not to be rudei also used to be really anxious to the point i could not write anything on the internet becuz im just so weird and be judged again online and also people might figure out who i am in real lifei feel like im constantly trying to approve myself and afraid other people will hate me and then hate me again for knowing i have these crazy creepy negative overthinking thought and obsessionsso anyways now at this point just turned off the message notification because i would rather not answer or answer late than answering in the weirdest way possible help anyone also dealing with the same problem,anxiety4202,literally this shit is ruining my life i cant no more ive never been depressed and i dont want to head down that road being afraid and anxious about everything is torture knowing i am never gonna find love and be lonely is sad a fuck looking like im okay from the outside and knowing that im suffering from the inside hurt why do i have to be scared of everything i wish it came easy always making up scenario in my head but knowing it wont be true really get me down im writing this cause im trying my best to talk to this girl but i just cant and get so nervous im really am gonna die lonely never really experiencing a proper girlfriend already  and been single all my life i just want to cry and let everything out,anxiety4203,ive always thought there wa something very wrong with me social anxiety made me hate every part of being around people and even if i somehow had a good time i regretted it later on because i felt like ive let too much of myself show and people hated me im still often convinced that i can only be hated or pitied buti see more and more that i wa living in a prison i constructed for myself every part of it wa build from element i thought were useful i thought i wa making sense of the whole social thing guided by traumatic event of my past a if there wa something to figure out but the thing that guided me were mostly random in nature and i had no idea how free i wa all this timei still often think that there something really wrong with me but im getting better at not listening to it im still very easily shaken off balance in most social situation because i cant help my brain freaking out but im getting better at putting it all into perspective because ive lost so many year it wa the time i shouldve been enjoying myself others life and working towards something instead i wa quietly suffering between fawning learned helplessness and just outright paranoia and depression and im still very alone but at least i feel like there a light at the end of the tunnelmaybe someone will relate i find it cathartic to write it all out publicly,anxiety4204,or even care about what other people think a little lessi have a huge problem with worrying about what others think of me it allllll i think about along with having social anxiety i have borderline personality disorder so i am incredibly touchy and emotionally fragile when it come to interacting with other human being when someone who is normally very nice to me becomes even the tiniest bit frosty towards me my whole world come crumbling down all i can think about is what did i do wrong whats wrong with me what did i say what humiliating thing did i do that made them go from liking me to hating me and then inevitably i am worthlesswhen i make a mistake i cant stop thinking about how much of an idiot other people must think i am i feel like everyone must think i am a weirdo and that brings me low self esteem on the flip side when i make a good impression i feel great about myself and i think about it constantly until i mess up even a little and go back to thinking everyone think i am an idiot and that i am ultimately worthless each and every day of my life is a rollercoaster of emotion it awful i absolutely hate living like this my self esteem is so abysmally low and everyone can see it see there i go again insecurity ooze out of my pore it so embarrassing yet again it embarrassing because im thinking about how people view meback to my question ha any one here made any progress what so ever in convincing themselves to stop caring what people think no matter how much i tell myself that their opinion dont matter something even slightly awkward will happen and my entire world fall apart i dont know what to do or how to make this better have you been able to tackle this issue do you have any advicethank you so much for reading,anxiety4205,which one work the bestview pollhttpswwwredditcompollywgl,anxiety4206,what ha helped you the most with crippling social anxiety i need help for this it affecting thing that are supposed to be fun i want to change it to feel better i appreciate your input,anxiety4207,colleague is a woman  she is gorgeous elegant blonde blue eye and very confident eye contact is quite the challenge because she simply wont look away but doesnt stare just pure confidencewe were all having an afternoon break  or  in the cafeteria and little by little people started leaving until it wa just the two of usi started to get up anticipating awkwardness but instead i looked at her and asked so how long have you been working here i knew she had been hired relatively recentlyshe smiled and said it had already been  month i wa surprised how long it had been so i kept asking question and the conversation just kept rollingit didnt last too long but it felt great no tension anxiety awkwardness nothingthis wa a big step on the path to recovery from year of social anxiety and isolation,anxiety4208,im at a point where i have a phobia of making friend  my only socializing currently is sometimes browsing rall by new and commenting on random post that catch my eye  most of my comment are attempt at being funny and a few of them are me giving advice that i really have no right to giveif i end up pming someone im unable to share personal detail  i dont want to  i dont trust them  they wont like me  etc etc  so all i really have is just random joke and occasional kind word  and thats iti dont know why using humor is the only way i feel semicomfortable talking to someone  well i know why now but i dont know how it originated  i can remember being a kid in elementary school and making other kid laugh by pretending to walk into a wall  i also recall a time that i took a bite of a stick like i wa going to eat it  hmmi think what ultimately sealed my fate here wa the one longterm relationship i had when i became an adult  i wa attracted to her but i think we were only connected by our sense of humor  she wa not attracted to me  two year later we started dating but i only ever remember getting compliment related to making her laugh  id say something a little off the wall and shed laugh and say i love you in a way that felt real and sincere  other than that well multiple time she informed me that she wa creeped out by how i liked her so much before we dated  sometimes some compliment during sex but that wa because i wa doing some serious overcompensation because i knew she wasnt attracted to me  it left u with a very onesided sexual relationship  i spent a lot of time postbreakup regretting not being a better sexual partner a if that would have changed anything  i had just tied part of my value to that aspect of our relationship  and humoroh lord did i spend year going online and trying to be funny  i wa very random and my technique wa throwing everything against the wall and see what stuck  needle to say that didnt go over well  i came across a insensitive ignorant and even antagonisticthe few friend that i grew up with left me out of thing mostly because of my different interest i worked night and that i wasnt willing to drop everything and move out of state to where they did  i remember one night when i wa struggling with a personal decision and i wa texting my friend about it  didnt really get much response  week later they didnt even remember what i talked aboutlater in life i returned to a group of people ive known most of my life  i dont want to get specific but basically if they knew my true opinion they would avoid me like the plague  that mean i see no point in forming close bond with anyone there because of this very conditional relationshipand now i dont have anybody to talk to  and im too afraid to take the chancebut im surprisingly hopeful for the first time in a very very long time  i realized i had been waiting all this time for someone to walk into my life and validate me  to show me how to love myself  but thats not going to happen  and truly accepting that is freeing in a way  it make me see my personal problem in more logical way and i think of way to solve them by myselfunfortunately old habit die hard  it a struggle to not fall back on the wish for someone to help me up  or the desire for validationi dont know  i hate writing this  my instinct will probably be to delete it in a few hour  but i guess i wanted to vent and remind myself of who i am  be honest with myself you know,anxiety4209,im  and after year of practicing this is the worst i have ever beenim insanely bored and have no friend so if anyone want to vent reply give me advice or anything please reply it pm and i live in east coast of the united state,anxiety4210,removed,anxiety4211,it say in the email with the zoom link that it wa at  today and i shower up at  because i didnt read it i feel so fucking stupid that im always the one fucking up like this im always the one who doesnt get the memo or fails to read the instruction and i keep making a retard of myselfshit iike this and constantly making a fool of myself everywhere i go is probably why i have social anxiety im so goddamn sick of humiliating myself like this,anxiety4212,i began to find many opportunity where we were able to be alone and try to talk more about ourselves but when we hung out the next time with a group of other people i got quiet and froze up alot i zoned out a lot and missed important social cue from him and he might of began to think i wa ignoring him all his response and dm have dried up and he only been talking in the group chat am i overthinking this more or have i actually spooked him off because i got nervous and lost in my head,anxiety4213,this morning i had my first therapy session at the start my throat closed up and i cried a lil but by the end it felt really good and im ready to keep going im starting to understand just how much my childhood affected me and i used to think that wa it for me but i can change and i will,anxiety4214,i had an extrovert phase in high school around th grade i dont know whydo yall relate so maybe i can piece it together,anxiety4215,when im out in public it feel like everyone keep looking at me i become paranoid of my every move

getting my thought out and sometimes and often i say something and people ask me to repeat many time  and i feel like that affected my self confidence because it always happen and i feel like people dont want to talk with people that cant communicate properly but here is som exemples of itwhen i saw a new person in the back of our workplace that i havent seen before i said hey man do you work here but they must of heard something heam djowrk here at school i saw a classmate and said  hey mark how you doing today but they must of heard something  hey mark howdjo todayi dont stutter but i fuck up my sentence and people ask me to repeat the stuff so many time that it make it not worth it i stopped talking to people cuz when i speak it so hard to understand i just want the word of what im doing so i can youtube it or something and practice on a solution,anxiety4217,tldr i am in therapy and do force myself to go out but i am becoming more and more anxious about social situation im fine when im traveling or when im with a boyfriend im not afraid i am ashamed is there anything else i can dothis all started almost exactly  year ago i had a number of traumatic social situation i broke up with a long term boyfriend and i ended up losing my friend along with the relationship at the same time i started a professional career it wa a lot of big change and i wasnt totally successful my attempt to find friend led to multiple sexual assault and bullying i wa also bullied at work until i finally quit a few week after a kidnappingsa my art career wa really taking off at this point but over the next few month i just stopped being able to do art at all and became extremely nervous about going out i got into therapy worked on myself and just tried to present myself in a better way this wa successful i got a new group of friend who are all very successful people and that led me to meet a new boyfriend this resolved all of my social anxiety i felt confident and good again but that boyfriend ended up being abusive and i left a few month later the friendship all dissipated a they all moved away during covid i wa mostly ok though and i wa dating i met a new boyfriend who lived in a city just outside of the major city i live in being with him and being there i felt totally normal and confident again but a soon a i wa back home and if he wasnt here with me i would feel that frozen stuck feeling all over again i ended up having to break up with him and now im more isolated than ever and just realized today that this is really serious and getting worse i dont fear getting assaulted again or anything like that i feel shame i feel too ugly too old to do shuffled my hair is too messy my eyebrow are too thin my skin is too bad im beautiful and i know this but this is the contradictory feeling in my head i also have a terrible feeling of shame that everyone i meet end up not liking me and i have to avoid them so im afraid of running into them it feel like ive burned bridge in every corner of the city i do know though that somebody else bullying me or somebody assaulting me doesnt make me the bad person nevertheless im the one who alone if i run into them with all of their friend the general feeling is overwhelming shamei dont have any of these problem when i travel i travel alone and go to dice restaurant by myself and do all sort of thing when im traveling i just dont feel this when im traveling i also dont feel it when im with a partner only when im by myself only in this city ive been in therapy for the past  year and talk about all of this and worked through trauma a much a wa possible and i do force myself to go out and be confident but i can honestly barely function to the point that i dont eat because im too ashamed to go to the grocery store i dont consciously fear being assaulted again or anything my fear is about being ugly and being old and i am too ashamed to go anywhere even the grocery store which lead me to not eating for day on end when i get stuck is there anything else i can do beyond exposure therapy and just talking to a therapist,anxiety4218,i received my last week test and i scored  and at the same time i wa giving another test which also went pretty amazing i guessi am also very socially awkward around girl very and i somehow managed to confirm the answer from the girl besides me and we interacted a bit a well so many thing in a single day quite a progess if you ask me ,anxiety4219,about a year ago in my college humanity course we had to make  website entry a a project about various topic that wa being taught in lieu of an essay for each quarter me being a people pleaser with adhd spent a lot of time and creativity making each page that i wa super proud of even if it meant sacrificing other part of my life  hyper fixation so one day i wa joining the usual zoom seminar session with my camera off disabled and with a camera blocker and out of nowhere my professor brought up my webpage to the whole class ish student and analyzed it word for freakin word sat for maybe around  minute frozen in fear and adrenaline all my muscle tight and brain ready to explode in anticipation for any type of criticism rsd and of course there wa some but honestly i forgot how i reacted since the whole thing already felt horrible and sarcasticthe awkward part wa after that when the prof sent u into random break room to work on the next assignment and student there expected me to lead them or be an expert or something this happened a few more time later in the year and i remember having a similar reaction have yall had any experience like this,anxiety4220,i had the absolute worst dayi had this practical session and my partner wa late so they didnt let them in i then i had to pair with some else but he wasnt of any help ended up having login issue so couldnt actually take part in the session and i just felt so embarrassed everyone wa at work apart from me and the teacher wa being a bit rude a well lolshould i feel badembarrassed even tho it wasnt exactly my fault,anxiety4221,i dont do any physical activity so my dad asked me if i wanted to start going to the gym i agreedwe went he talked about the gym plan with the receptionist and took me upstairs where the equipment wa to have a look the moment i stepped in i swear i started sweating more than the actual guy working out,anxiety4222,just wondering if anyone else ha had significant struggle with the anticipation of others response on any form of mobile messaging from others to the point where your subconscious mind make you avoid it entirely there is this guy k really like and when i found out he like me too i stopped messaging him entirely and i just cant make myself do it is there anyway to think of messaging him back in a way that make it easier or doe anyone know a way to trick myself into messaging him back,anxiety4223,hi i f dont have a great sense of fashion i have never really been interested in it and i prefer to dress for comfort i have a few outfit that look nice but generally i just prefer legging and a t shirt however i constantly worry that people are judging my clothing choice my last boyfriend encouraged me to buy new clothes and that wa really hurtful ive slowly started dating again and i can help but think every guy will realize i am a loser with no fashion sense ,anxiety4224,the people i work with closely i can have a conversation with and generally am comfortable around most of the time there another department that i have to go out to pretty often that i find hard to chat with the guy who work there ive been there for  year and i feel like i should know more about these people and be more comfortable just chatting but im not it sorta make me feel shitty sometimes when i think about it like im a weirdo or something lol i find they dont really chat with me or ask me question so im a little hesitant to ask them stuffi try to say good morning everyday if i need to ask them a question or let them know something i can usually do that no problem i find the one that i sorta can chat with joke with me a lot and i dont know how to respond sometimes like i know their joking and im cool with that i just dont know how to respond doe anyone have any advice should i just not think to much of it and let it go or should i really try to chat with them more,anxiety4225,im in my first year of college now but my social anxiety is making it so hard to interact with people and make friend sometimes i will literally stay in my dorm all day if i dont have to go out because of my intense fear of other people i also struggle w being myself which make it even harder to make friend can anyone relate to this or have any advice of how you made it through college with social anxiety,anxiety4226,i only talk in a friendly or social manner to a couple people at work small company  i dont even go to company party  yesterday i went to a good movie that i wanted to recommend to others so today i decided to post a recommendation on our company slack site  i should have hesitated and thought whether i wa posting this in the right spot  we have a general message board but people usually only use this for workrelated announcement like needing to take off  then we have a random channel for other stuff but hardly anybody us it  the last post wa from a couple week agoit didnt even enter it in the random channel where it belonged i just went right for the general even though i am aware that almost all post are work related  so i posted it and a few people said thanks  then i looked on the channel later and it had a description that i dont think wa on it previously saying it wa for workrelated stuff while the random wa for water cooler stuffso even though nobody reprimanded me i feel like a fool for not realizing the correct channel  ive been making other mistake at work ive been at the place for decade that i suspect ha some wondering if im fit for this job,anxiety4227,mat this point im pretty confident that all my social anxiety and social skill difficulty stem back to me being bullied by my peer on a near daily basis from kindergarten to th grade started out being a little off i think and developed into full blown ostracization the worst thing is i hardly have any specific example because my memory from back then are so horribly fragmented i have almost no memory of my childhoodi have no idea how to get past this i dont feel comfortable around people and have no idea what to say when i am around them i can function fine in a professional context but a soon a the conversation becomes personalsocial i shut the fuck down and just want to run awayi dont have any friend at all although i am married fucking how right once a week i play tabletop rpg with her and her friend and while i like them i just feel so miserable there being with all these people  even one that i know are very nice and understandingat this point i have trouble going outside  i go to work home and the store i am developing health problem because i am so out of shape but i am terrifed to run outside or even take a walk and most physical activity just reminds me of being this terrified confused child in gym class that need to throw a ball but is so terrified of being bullied for sucking at sport so i just shut downi just cant seem to find any working help for this problem ive tried therapist and medication and nothing seems to help me i spend hour a day scrolling on reddit and im sure it a form of self harm at this point because i seek out content of other people struggling with social skill and people and they make a social mistake and everyone just rip off their head and shit down their neck for making iti self harmed for the first time in a few week last night reading a post on another sub where a guy with autism wa struggling with social relationship made a mistake due to not understanding some social norm and got absolutely fucking crucified for it i know this kind of content is not good for me but i seek it out anywaysat this point i have no idea how to get better all the bullying resource seem to exist only for child or adult who are experiencing workplace bullying and trauma resource are for those with real problem no help at all for the kid werent nice growing up and now im sad sademoji sademoji idk if this post even make sense or if there is any help for me but i need to get it out sorry if i dont reply quickly i read your post but am probably just too scared to respond,anxiety4228,so im  year old and i have never been in a relationship never been on a date and generally never even got close to a relationship and now i do realize that there load of people out there that had their first relationship even later than me but im definitely at a point where im the odd one out for never having dated among my peer and that is just really getting to me lately not even because i want to keep up with others or because i think that you should be in a relationship at a certain age but it really ruin my self esteem because im genuinely starting to feel like im not attractive or interesting at all to the opposite gender im a pretty introverted guy so i never really met that many people which is definitely a big part of the problem but after covid i made quite an effort to go out more talk to people go to social gathering i made a few dating profile in which i actually put in some effort and what i thought were some decent picture of me but none of those thing got me closer to actually connecting with people even though i had some day where i felt like i had some nice conversation with people it just never got further than that i met a few more people im friendly with that seem to enjoy my company enough to invite me to social gathering and stuff but even then i have a hard time actually feeling like im connecting with anyone everybody just seems to be friendly but there never anybody showing interest in me or approaching me i tried taking matter into my own hand a few time and tried to approach people myself but that also didnt really change anything a few week ago i even asked out a girl that seemed nice she actually agreed to meet up and sounded quite enthusiastic about it but told me she didnt have time and would text me when shes free and then i never heard from her again which im not even mad about it whatever but it just further and further giving me this feeling that while people might find me nice enough to hang out with occasionally it seems like im just not interesting enough for people to want to get to know me more closely and i really dont know how to deal with that anymore im about to give up my adventure of going out more because it just really exhausting to me and honestly going to social gathering but still feeling alone in the midst of it all make me feel way more lonely than spending week in my room talking to nobody i just cant keep this up because my mental health is really suffering from this but at the same time i cant go on like i did before im genuinely lonely and desperately need people i can feel connected to but it just too much for me to do what it take to form these relationship it seems,anxiety4229,well ive been out of work since  i wa sick for a year or two ive applied

pretty much the same but in the second half of the year i had the opportunity to talk with one of them and he told me that i should start to get close to them when they talk and that im missing a lot then i promised that the next day i will finally stand up during the break an stay with them a little group of friend i did it it wa a big goal but wasnt that hard the hard thing wasis talking with

make friend and maybe ask her out but im not going to waste  more yearsi wont give him this satisfaction,anxiety4232,i am moving into a shared house for a new job in london i have been living alone for the past year a i hated living with stranger so much one of the main issue wa my tendency to not go into the kitchen if people were in therein the house i find it hard to focus on more than one thing at a time so when i cook i like to keep in my own mind and focus on what im doing i dont want to have to to be distracted by small talk of others im also a bit of a people pleaser so find it hard to take myself off to do my own thing once someone start chatting with me also after work im usually socially drained so dont have the social energy to be a nice and chatty a i could be since living alone ive noticed i save so much money on food a i cook rather than get takeaway all the timehow can i overcome this in my next house share also worth noting when ive lived with familypeople i get on well with in the past im fine using the kitchenany tip or suggestion would be most appreciated other than get a grip haha,anxiety4233,im sitting in my room waiting for my apartment maintenance to arrive in the next hour and just uncontrollably cry from the overwhelming anxiety why am i like this im also blowing through all my saving bc im too afraid to apply for a job and work in public im just straight up incompatible for life at this point,anxiety4234,i moved to canada for school last year and i still havent made solid friend i know for me a a socially anxious introvert such thing take time but i cant help but feel like im selfsabotaging and will never make friend at all i mean i know you guy can all relate to meeting new people but never having the courage to set up another meeting sometimes i even end up ghosting new potential friend because im afraid theyll ask me to go out with them and im too scared to do that whats annoying is that i am desperately craving deeper connection and i really want to find my people but this vicious cycle continues of me meeting new people once and then never having the courage to seek out the friendship it weird co i really crave company but at the same time id rather just be by myself like make it make sense how do i get out of this,anxiety4235,i dont know where to begin my mind too hazy with brain fog to even come up with anything coherent to say i wonder if typing out anything lengthy will even be worth it if i dont get response but the brain fog part of my problem i have adhd and autism and i sometimes wonder if theyre huge contributor to my inferiority complexi dont feel like im equal to many of my peer friend included i feel like it why i struggle to make friend why i dont approach anybody because i psych myself out before i even have a chance to speak but i do that because i often dont have a clue on how to break the ice with new people im too caught up into my own head to know what others are talking about and i feel guilty about that and i feel worse not being involved in a conversation because i have no clue whats going on it make me hate myselfthat said i do have plenty of friend i consider to be good friend i get along with them fine but i wish i could get along with them better but also how much better can i really make those friendship theyre fine a is i guess i get insecure thinking that they have their life together or that theyre working on it and here i am not im stuck i dropped out of school and working a dead end job my endeavor in music are few and far between nowadays because my own motivation is cut what am i living for all i need to do is work for what i want but  i dont know how to work anymore and  i dont know if i can really call music a passion of mine anymore if im not working on itmy closest friend at the moment ive had feeling for her for a long while now she doesnt feel the same way about me and thats been fine because she still make a lot of time for me and she see me a her best friend but recently she started dating a new friend and thats flared up these feeling again anyway i touched upon why she might not have seen me in that way before last night she told me the biggest reason wa because i idolized her that i saw myself a lesser than her when shed want me to see myself a an equal and that really put thing into perspective for memy inferiority complex run deep i dont know where it stem from but i want to understand it and break free from it why do i feel lesser than the people around me whats causing it how do i help myselfim so tired of feeling this way and im so tired of losing out what i could be having,anxiety4236,i just let go off the useless thought in my head and felt so liberated,anxiety4237,well this

whole time but im so glad it happened my therapist is gonna be happy when she hears about this progress ive made,anxiety4243,i find it hard to look back at people specifically when theyre looking at me when i accidentally lock eye with someone i have a mini heart attack and it feel like getting jumpscared in a horror gamei also have a really bad fear of being watched even if people arent looking at me if im in their presence i freeze and my muscle lock upive been dealing with this for  year now and i dont know what to do anymore whenever i actually manage to act like a normal human my neck will suddenly spasm to ruin the moment and embarrass me in front of everyone i dont even have any friend i just want to cry,anxiety4244,im not sure if it due to my social anxiety but i dont talk about my feeling to even my family so yep when i have problem unless they ask me about it specifically i tend to keep thing to myself when my best friend is busy especially since he recently found a girlfriend i basically have no one to talk to my best friend also is quite emotionally reserved so it quite tough for me to open up to him in the end i use like my private instagram account to tell ppl im not doing well mentally it my only way to cope but to no availi just envy those people that have so many friend of all gender and like they are always texting someone i kinda want something liddat but of course not like alot at least more than what i have now and the ability to text others whatever i want to say i actually have tried to converse with some girl a i try to step out of my comfort zone but end up not knowing what to say and it just make me seem like a boring person all the time im not sure if they stop talking to me cause i am boring or im just simply ugly hurt my self esteem and doesnt improve the fact i have no one to talk to never ending cycleanyone can relate,anxiety4245,i just need some positive word im struggling today and would love to run away from work

me once i get my degree i got a job a a front security front desk for luxury apartment person and the trainer said i had no phone etiquette and i quit that same day so if i get in the it field and do

day,anxiety4247,m i moved to a new city and school last year and have adapted surprisingly well i have a few acquaintance but only two real close friendsso i wa texting a friend of mine tonight and

hope not because he a good friend and id rather not mess thing up over saying something so stupidif he doesnt reply even with anything i will feel like a huge moronshit,anxiety4248,do yall ever find yourselves consciously or unconsciously taking mental stock of interaction after every social event and basically trying to gauge how well you performed happens all the time and the only way i can seem to stop it is actively telling myself that thinking about it after the fact is of no consequence,anxiety4249,whenever a conversation is going good and isnt awkward i overthink about it then start stuttering and cause my social anxiety to flare up why cant i just have a normal conversation without thinking about it,anxiety4250,i have had social anxiety since i wa a child if you meet me

dime off anything she take adderall which make her talk my ear off she get delusion of grandeur to the max about fame and fortune it quite scary to witness her main goal always boil down to one thing making money and she plan on being my manager and taking a cut of the money id supposedly make which make her foam at the mouth with excitement i have been friend with her for  year but this obsession with making money off me grew to uncomfortable level when i started living with her on and off in march she sent me  text last night while i wa sleeping about her plan on creating a band together and also me a a solo artist sound great in theory but i told her multiple time i dont want to do it the good news is that my flight home is on thursday and i can rip away from her moneyhungry grip bad news is that i am scared to tell her im leaving because then shell whine till the cow come home i feel such relief knowing later this week i will be alone in my room,anxiety4251,in all these year i keep asking on reddit and other forum question about my lack of social liferelationship or explaination about certain behavior about people that treated me in certain way i used to keep why they acted like this exci ask people on internet question about everything happening to me but i do that over and over even after year just to know better the psychological reason behind some situation or behaviori have ocd but i dont know if it could be an autism trait,anxiety4252,guy i just went on a date with this nice girl it wa terrible i wa so boring i almost couldnt speak when we chatted

change and make some friend ive tried to talk to people but i just cant fit inand at this point halfway into first semester im strongly considering just taking online class to get my credit in and finish this year it would mean i couldnt take ap class but my grade have already been awful my anxiety make it really hard to concentrate in class and by the time i get home im too exhausted to study much i know this is probably a bad idea and would just set me back further into isolation but i dont see why thing would be any better if i went through another year of this,anxiety4254, im on my first year in college and i already have  presentation to do i just dont wanna do it but im afraid i just have to if i want to continue this study im diagnosed with social anxiety and im still on therapy thought i wa so ready to go to college this year but i simply cant handle those presentation and no it wont get easier every time i do it it not working for me like that i already had a progress when it come to social interaction but presenting in front of people is where i set my boundary and  now i feel like a failure cause i dont think i can get a degree like that also like my therapist will be disappointed and i dont even wanna talk about it with her,anxiety4255,for a long time ive always feared human interaction bc it make me nervous and uneasy i think i struggle with social anxiety it is frustrating me so much but ive realized that i need to do something in order to overcome it after a month of trying to get out and go to the gym which wa a fail i decided yesterday to try it again i went to the gym but just stood outside for  whole hour contemplating if i should go in or not during those two hour i had my first encounter with some homeless child on the street i sat with them and talked to them and bought them street food which got them so excited then i went to the nearest convenience store to get them more food to share with the rest of their family when i got there i wa able to have a small conversation with the mom this felt really great to me bc that little interaction is a bit of progress for me and it wa a really nice thing to do a well it felt nice i stood closer to the gym door after that when i saw another person which is an old man trying to fix some thing so i went closer to him and asked him if he needed help through that we were able to have an hour conversation about his life and i asked question a well really talking normally without feeling uncomfy and thats another achievement for me then a guy from the gym went out he asked me about what kind of conversation i had with the old man so we talked then i thought it wa a perfect opportunity for me to get into the gym so i openly told him how i actually wanna sign a membership at the gym which wa my plan for a long time already and we just casually talked and encourage me to not be shy and said to me the thing is if u dont try and keep living in fear nothing will happen and improve which ofc i knew but yes that wa exactly what i needed to do i peeked again inside and asked him how and stuff and he said well you should come to me bc i am the owner of this gym  it wa embarrassing but guess what i got the membership and im writing this right just after i got out of the gymaside from that ever since our school started every once in a while i would talk and participate in our class i still shake a lot esp my hand right after i talk but thats alright  im just trying to be consistent until such time that i could be able to do it without feeling anxiousidk all this just make me happy so i just wanna share it there are time that i still not do well enough but it doesnt end there every day is another day to make improvement i really wanna get over this so im trying really hard ik there are most people here that struggle with social anxiety a well but well get over it ,anxiety4256,despite being socially completely braindead im planning to approach my crush with  preparation or any kind of advice from a therapist or people with better social skill is this the right course of action should i practise first or at least talk to people about it beforehandknowing me there a very good chance itll go poorly i wa sure at first but im starting to second guess myself now there also the fact that shes heavily introverted,anxiety4257,a couple of month ago i wrote into a relationship podcast looking for some advice i really loved their empathetic approach when responding to listener question so i felt pretty safe doing so i assumed they probably wouldnt end up reading mine but it felt good to get thing off my chestto my surprise they ended up reading it the advice they gave pretty much lined up with stuff i had already heard and been working on since i wrote the letter but for some reason hearing my own long winded letter read back to me just felt so embarrassing and i just couldnt help feeling ashamed when they were giving the advice it not like they were mean they werent at all but my anxious brain found it easy to assume they were judging me i thought hearing them talk about my problem would make me feel better but instead im feeling really embarrassed and ashamed i really didnt expect to have this kind of reaction and i feel kind of dumb now for writing in at all,anxiety4258,removed,anxiety4259,i cant even apply for anything im just too scared of literally every step of the process i made the mistake of applying somewhere and now they want to call me next theyll want to have an interview then introduce me to the team im clsoe to passing out just thinking about it,anxiety4260,im super anxious cause i overthought while answering to a text and then sent something really weird like word that do not fit the situation and may come off a offensive cause i wanted to make someone feel better so i wanted to make them laugh but looking back it didnt work at all and i would be bummed out if i read that text if i just said my genuine first response it would have been more natural and me and not awkward now im afraid the person will not tell me their inner feeling or they will not contact me any morei probably should have given myself more time and just answered much later after thinking like other people do i also get this impulsive feeling i have to answer back at a timely moment dont read it too fast nor too late not to seem to idle or desperate and seem a bit mysteriousbusy but not to be rude and it fucking me up so badi also used to be really anxious to the point i could not write anything on the internet cuz i thought it wa weird and people would judge me for what i wroteso anyways at the moment i just turned off my message notification cuz i would rather not answer answer late than answering weirdlyanyone dealing with the same problem,anxiety4261,i know this is very ironic and kinda mean,anxiety4262,i find it soo much scarier to make phone call rather than doing thing in real life doe anyone have tip to approach making the call ,anxiety4263,worst part of having social anxiety is making enemy without even meaning to people will say thing like you dont look approachable or youre not a good sportbro i mean you no harm im literally trying to not have a panic attack just functioning out in publici have no energy to mean you harm im drowning in my own stuff,anxiety4264,i hate this i cant go to work i cant rest properly cant focus cant do thing that im supposed to cant enjoy thing i really have no clue what to do i hope it get

place id want to be but i recently went to concert and just being with myself and not having to worry about anyone else just make it easy for me i mean standing concert with no seating   of course i get stressed about a million thing before i go  will i be on time too early too late will i need to check anything at the checkroom will they let me in with my water bottle they dont will someone ask me what the hell im doing on my own will people stare at me etc but once im there and the light are out i can just have a nice time  being independent help a lot i feel i can stand wherever i want and move around when i want or when i get anxious and even theoretically go deep into the crowd i can go get a beer in the middle of a song if i feel like it if i see there no queue for example or go to the toilet talk to someone or talk to nobody the whole time and i dont owe anyone an explanationdo you people feel the same what do you think it is exactly that make it easy being in the dark only having to worry about myself what fun activity would you actually prefer to do alone,anxiety4268,i recently had the courage to admit a crush i have on a girl ive never done this before and she reciprocated my feeling it long distance and weve been talking everyday im also going to visit her country in january however since i struggle with anxiety im scared that ill say something wrong and at the same time i dont want the conversation to be one sided so far it seems like she know how to start them with more ease ive asked my friend for advice but i dont think they get me and thought i should ask other people who also have social anxiety,anxiety4270,so i am  i have social anxiety and it really difficult to attend school and class or just anything  coz of it and i am trying my best

uncomfortable being the only one that is not eating but i am also uncomfortable eating lol,anxiety4279,for context ive been working a warehouse job for  year and i love my job simply for the fact

greet guest hand them club for minigolf and answer their question it make me super nervous about even accepting the job even though the pay is quite better and it is way closer to home then my other

or not but i just started a new job yes my first ever at  and im currently in training but im having these little moment where i get suddenly overwhelmed like i dont know what to do embarrassment and anxiety sink and i want to run feel like i need to be told what to do and dont know how to think on my own not sure if it because im still in training but i just feel like a lost lamb and it pathetic god sa suck so hard,anxiety4290,removed,anxiety4291,ive been reading some success story and want to be able to share some of me own in the future,anxiety4292,removed,anxiety4293,i only think of her a a friend but im worried itll be taken the wrong way i just got so ive been asking my friend for theirs,anxiety4294,i feel like this is especially true for those of u with sa doe anyone else here feel especially selfcritical i do i find myself constantly thinking i bet im the worst teacher on the planet i bet my student hate me and my class i bet my coworkers think im incompetent i am ugly i am stupid i am worthless the worst part is seeking reassurance that such thing arent true isnt not only a bad look it exhausting for others so i dont do it but doe anyone else here find themselves dealing with such thought,anxiety4295,i have found that lately some day my social anxiety is really bad to the point where it extremely difficult for me to interact with others especially at work when i have to see patient talk to coworkers but some day i can talk to people with no issue if our personality mesh well however when someone ha a strong personality it make me feel inferior and i dread having to talk with them or find a way out of it doe this happen to anyone else i just wanted to vent because i recently started a new job that i hoped would be better for my anxiety but im worrying that it not and that i made a bad decision,anxiety4296,so obviously it very hard to interact with people under such fear but when im able to do that im so happy and so proud of even doing a small talk or putting my one word into a conversation but in the reality people have other perspective they see my anxiety and ask why im so shy or am i uncomfortableand it quite interesting because for me it a win win but for them i still look like somethings off lolits impossible to hide anxiety but that wont stop me from trying because i am me and it the way i am and actually accepting it help me relax a bit,anxiety4297,i always feel like my classmate dread talking to me because of how quiet and awkward i am i also tend to stutter and take long pause in between what im saying even though i try my best not to i cant even hold eye contact without having to look away at the floor or at my paper for a few second like today i wa in a group with two other people and i had to read my work out loud to them and i spoke in an extremely low voice and paused for a few second before i could finish reading and it wa so embarrassing then my professor and my classmate had to give me feedback which wa really helpful and i greatly appreciated it but i seemed like i wasnt interested in what they had to say because i couldnt hold eye contact with them a they spoke i also had the opportunity to help one of my group member because his laptop wa dead and he couldnt share his work but instead i sat there and did nothingi just want to speak to my classmate with the same ease they do with each other many of them have even become acquainted or friend with each other while im a loner because no one want to talk to the quiet studentis anyone else currently dealing with a similar situation whether it be at school work etc,anxiety4298,to preface  i dont like the industry im in  i sort of fell into it  year ago and have stayed since my goal is to one day make a huge career change but im not there yet throughout the last  year post college ive been working in corporate america for the same company in various role the feedback i consistently get is that i need to be more assertive confident speak up i try and dont really make much traction it borderline painful to make small talk ask question during meeting think of solution on the spot at meeting i just dont know what to say and every single time i have a meeting i sit there in dread leading up to it and during it i know most career will involve some level of meeting but im at the point where i cant tolerate the constant anxiety and dread i also struggle with depression so overall my motivation is low i probably look like an idiot who contributes nothing to the team doe anyone have tip on how to overcome or even slightly improve social anxiety in the workplace to add i work from home and it make no difference to my anxiety level a team call is just a unbearable a in person my current manager is noticing and it look really bad and to top it off most of the work is centered around conversation and follow ups at meeting so it not like i have all this tangible work to make up for lack of participation really feeling hopeless here thanks in advance,anxiety4299,how did you do it like when being in school you met ton of girl all the time and some had the luck there wa this strange girl who would want to be with you me toobut since i am over  and unemployed i feel like it became impossible to find a girl since everyone is an adult now and in the mindset of real lifemy peer finished a fancy education and have their nice job and such i dont get any match on tinder ever and if i meet girl in rl they are shocked by my mental state and unemploymentso are there any guy who are neet sa

to do this i actually just work off file on my own and im not trained how to lead a team and this is something i never wanted to do i can work in a team but i guess i am a horrible team leader for extrovert it not really a problem but i feel burnt out from all the talking and interacting very quickly and it already pushing my limit and this go on for some timeweeks month i dont know how im going to keep this up i just want to go back to working off file can someone please write something positive thank you,anxiety4301,today i enrolled in class to become a medical assistant this is a big deal for me because there are some class that i will have to take on campus and some online i only took online class for my last degree because i wa too afraid to set foot in a classroom however the degree is very general and doesnt have a clear career path ive always wanted to work in healthcare but i let my social anxiety hold me back from pursuing that im not letting it keep me from chasing my dream anymore i have a vision of the life id like to live and im going to fight for it i wa also recently prescribed sertraline and im noticing some improvement with my anxiety so im hoping that paired with the propanolol that ive already been taking will help me get through school a well i just wanted to share this with you guy to encourage you to face your fear i know first hand how social anxiety robs u of so much but we have the power to take control of our life im not saying it will be easy but it possible,anxiety4302,i honestly get so stressed at having friend from different environment meet each other i think it because im worried they wont like each other and then it will be awkward same with like my family and friend meeting i dont know why it to an irrational level because i know it not helpful or even logical to feel so strongly about this and it only hurt myself bc the people i care about dont really know each other well doe anyone else relate,anxiety4303,if that isnt progress idk what is xd,anxiety4304,removed,anxiety4305,i apologise in advance if thats too common question and wa asked too many time beforei am really willing

myself in a house again and scared to get a job and talk to peoplehave no friend since moved to uk  year ago and i actually need a therapy unfortunately i cant afford it yet but i am doing so much stuff everyday to get rid of it myself so i thought maybe some exercise book would move this process a little bit more further i am so tired of it but it is getting better i can tell thank you,anxiety4306,some were because i liked the girl too much some were because i didnt and some i wa awkward and embarrassed myself it just suck ive been alone for a while now and decided that i wa going to be more social in the hope of meeting someone i have social anxiety and sometimes i feel like people laugh at me after they leave i think maybe i blow thing out of proportion but ive been around group who just obliterate people after an interaction so it make sense to me im not bad looking im just bad at talking i guess im kind and considerate maybe to a fault i dont like dirty talk or making aggressive move unless i know they will be reciprocated i just want to be respectful i feel most comfortable being quiet because i dont know what to say and id rather not embarrass myself

one date and told that i seem like im interested in a relationship which is something they werent ready forso that wa fair but it just so defeating i dont feel like i understand people anymore i guess social medium ha turned u all into shiny object and everyone is focused on who can getbe the shiniest thing in the room it not me i dont want to be an object ive been treated like an object my whole

kinda nice being there there were some people i enjoyed talking to and the other day when we were leaving for home i suggested to one of the classmate that we should chat online more but unfortunately he told me hed rather if we spoke during these meetups because we far away from each other and therefore wont have much to talk about anyway more than a year later i still think of that conversation and it still hurt the same i understand his reason and i have nothing against people setting boundary but this wa a major setback for me since then i have hesitated many time and eventually decided not to reach out to people i have not spoken to in some time and i have hesitated to reach out to people i see every few month because i dread the same reaction from them now all i can think about is he probably wont be interested in talking to me more often anyway since we dont talk that often in the first placei have not been to the reunion this year i excused myself at the last minute and just didnt go it like the shadow of that conversation is still trailing after me in the last few year i made a few attempt to stay in contact over the internet with people i know irl because i found that acquaintance found online never evolve into friendship but the last year ha been kind of hopeless because of that experiencethis make me want to avoid any future reunion because i would have to go there knowing that most of these people probably dont want to hear from me more than once a year and that just feel horrible to me i wish i could reconnect with some of them but i suppose that is not something most people want,anxiety4311,ive had social anxiety for  year now and it stopped me from experiencing the kind of thing that other people my age have experienced party sex hanging out with friend all the time etc and im at the point where i want to say fuck my anxiety ive lost enough time because of it and i need to start socializing again anyways im ready to stop isolating and get a social life doe anybody have any tipsadvice for doing this,anxiety4312,i keep trying to connect with people but most of the time it not successful and if i achieve some semblance of a casual friendship with someone i feel like they end up getting bored of me im feeling so hopeless,anxiety4313,dont really vent like this but my sa is crippling me im  about to be  and feel so behind in life i cant hold a conversation for the life of me and people generally have no interest in talking to me i dont blame them though my anxiety manifest a anger but inside im really nervous and afraidi barely leave my house other than going to work and even that is really hard for me sometimeswork is also very depressing i remodel apartment building and it the same thing day after day and my co worker think im a psycho for never having anything to say and just standing there awkwardly while they talk all day and make an effort to not ask me anything i feel like a broken man it so alienating im in desperate need of advice on how to fix myself i dont want to feel this way anymore,anxiety4314,if anyone who ha gone through the social anxiety before i need to ask some question i have done the cognitive restructuring part and i am finding it really hard to do the exposure i would plan to speak to someone in class but i cant find the last moment courage to do it and then i am left

should have been about  of the way through practice i started putting in more effort but im embarrassed by my underperformance during the majority of practice im especially so because we were put into group and i wa in a really small group so it wa very apparent i wasnt really trying i wa thinking of sending an email to my coach to apologize for my lack of effort and say ill try better in the future but is it overkill am i overthinking it should i not send an email at all,anxiety4317,i know only shitty people with ego problem do that to other people they see the introvert nottalkative

errand i dont enjoy taking a walk on the street anymore for fear of someone i know passing by in their cari dont know whats wrong with me i wa at the grocery store recently and i almost went to hide

even friend today i went out to send a package i sold the line wa long and i had to tell the lady my tracking number since she told me to read it to her i did and there were people around and talking but surprisingly my voice wa loud enough for her to correctly put it in the system it wa actually able to track since i received a notification shortly after then i got an email to call back for a remote job i called back and these interaction both went smoothly and normal then i went to the thrift and a retail store now im on the bus home i hope i get a job soon despite all the anxiety,anxiety4322, here is my situation there is a cute girl at work i really like and think she like me a well i know a decent amount about her from our conversation at work i find it a bit odd that she never mentioned any relationship to me i dont know if she is single seeing another guy or is gay i never hear mention of a boyfriend just hanging out with friend going the gym and reading i did not see any guy on her ig just girl and she is not only very attractive and ha a great personality that is what is beginning to make me think she is gay in addition to her not mentioning any past relationship i do not not know how to go about asking  are you single with out sounding creepy and if she were to say yes to being single how would i respond that to see if she even like guy any advice would be appreciated a im feeling quite lost we are both  we work in healthcare and on another note i will be transferring to another facility in february,anxiety4323,i grew up a the shes so quietshy kid all throughout public school i wa always advanced when it came to readingwriting but math wa the subject that never came naturally to me in any capacity i fell behind at some point in elementary school due to my shyness and fear of asking for help a a result of my untreated major social anxiety this continued into high school and i never ever talked to my teacher or asked for help from anyone not even fellow classmate despite my mom constantly prodding me to go get help with my math work she would drop me off early in high school for extra homework help and i would wander the hall instead of going to see my teacher like she intended for me to do because i wa so scared and just couldnt bring myself to do it i couldnt face them i have always been especially anxious around authority figure it like the anxiety go up tenfold i just kept falling more and more behind and my parent were constantly angry at me for doing poorly and not trying hard enough or getting help because they thought i wa just lazy and didnt care or want to do better which just made it worse i wa constantly in fear because of my math grade i wa afraid my teacher would be mad or fed up with me too if i asked for help i wa afraid theyd think i wa stupid and beyond help several time my math grade were so bad that i wa called to a parent teacher conference and given a stern talking to which also made it worse i wa put into the remedial math class all through middle and high school and just barely managed to skate along and pas each one with a barely passing grade it wa like i wa drowning and nobody came to save me because i wa too scared to call for helpnow im  year old and i can hardly do what most people consider basic math thing like fraction percentage working with decimal number etc etc i still count on my finger i use my phone calculator for practically everything and would be pretty helpless without it the highest math class i ever took in school were geometryintermediate algebra which i actually didnt do too terribly at somehow im having to face the music now because im finally getting started taking online college class and in order to be able to take college algebra and get my required math credit i first have to pas a placement test since my high school math score were so low so right now im trying to study for it and im remembering just how hard math is for me and wishing id gotten help back then i feel like a pitiful excuse for an adult because i have no clue how to even begin to calculate what the price of item at the store are if theyre x off something everyone else i know can do almost instantaneously in their head i always have to ask someone else what it is or google it it fucking sad and i feel like my life would be so much better and id feel like a much more competent intelligent adult if i could do math sure i can get by but i always feel extremely stupid whenever i expose how bad my math ability are to other people,anxiety4324,just venting my nerve,anxiety4325,need to kinda vent get this off my chest somehow and trying to not let this thing ruin my day today i took another bus from college europe than usual because i saw some people who i knew from some time ago who i went to class with but dont have any contact with anymore who were going to take the usual one trying to avoid any awkward conversation or eye contact then shortly after getting to the next bus station someone from a current class of mine sat a few seat opposite me initially i wanted to greet him by nodding my head but he did not notice or wa looking at his phone or looking away so i assumed they didnt want to talk or talk to me specifically so i stared out the window next to them and kept doing this for the rest of the time once after looking up from my phone they might have been looking at me im not sure if they were then trying to greet me but since i thought they were not interested i kept looking outthis went on for  minute until im almost at the station where i want to leave so we dont potentially leave together i leave earlier i take another route than usual to the place i am going so that i dont stumble into said person but guess what happens i stumble into them try to nod hello again but they kind of ignore me and this time they definitely saw meit feel like my day is in shatters despite something great unrelated to any of this happening today i had one of my favorite meal to celebrate it and still feel like crap and couldnt even enjoy it really thing havent gone this bad in a while with my avoidance strategy tomorrow im going to see him in class again and i hate this feeling what if im the first one with them alone should i play it off like nothing happened why cant i be normal why cant i handle thing like this why is it ruining my day,anxiety4326,removed,anxiety4327,im about to do my final year project at university and we can either choose to be in a group or by ourselves the thing is id love to try and work on this big project alone however this includes having to do two presentation which are both marked if it werent for this one thing id happily work on this project by myself but the anxiety id go through if i had to present alone would be so overwhelming that i probably wouldnt be able to handle itthats why i chose to group up with a couple people i know instead so some of the stress is taken off but i feel like it dragging me down,anxiety4328,i left the house by myself probably for the first time ever i walked down the street to grab a coffee it wa painless it a monday

good,anxiety4329,help me because i loss confident and many thinking but in deep heart i am real man,anxiety4330,after a bit of a weird weekend away with friend a few month ago a mixture of getting a bad vibe and lot of class a i have been convinced that everyone i know ha got it in for mepeople have been fine with me since  and ive been invited out a much a i usually would but ive been unable to socalise with anyone due to an unshakable feeling that im being lured into some kind of trap the doctor put me on medication but it amplified the anxious feeling to an unbrable level so i took myself off of them the only thing that give me temporary relief is alcohol the rest of the time my body is in fight or flight mode and im playing various terrible scenario over and over,anxiety4331,thank you and sorry wa all that came out of my mouth whenever i spoke to anyone it wasnt until i made real friend that i spoke other word besides thank you and sorry and for that i am thankful for them my social anxiety ha always led me to embarassing situation which are forever etched into my memory i always ask myself everyday why am i like this to which i have no reply i wish i could communicate without having to worry about trivial thing but it so hard for no reason i wish i wa normal,anxiety4332,i had too much coffee and im super thirsty but im sitting at my table in the library sucking on my saliva for the past hour instead of going outside and getting some water from the dispenser because im scared itll attract transient attention or worse embarrassment if i

feel like it would be such a stupid reason to say no because im like scared because i cant really explain what im scared of they dont know how uncomfortable i get in social situation like that which is understandable because ive never really told them the only time i talked to my dad about it a couple year ago i said something about how it felt like people were staring at me and judging me he just said that since im getting older people are probably gonna be looking at me more sound a bit weird when it put like that but i know that wasnt his intention im just wondering if anyone ha the same experience with their parent it would be nice to get som advice instead of having to cry  min before going to the store acting like everything is fine lol,anxiety4336,i am socially anxious and although ive never shared my feeling or about my anxiety this subreddit is such a safe space to be in it kinda sound like comfort in others pain but it really just the knowing of more people going through what i am going through and the fact that im not alone with this thing thank you everyone for your story rant and sharing your pain it ha helped me in not alienating myself and im sorry we have to go through this much love to everyone of u going through this ,anxiety4337,im m definitely a very shy sensitive socially anxious person i dont like being the subject of one attention because a lot of my childhood trauma is from teacher and bully singling me out for my adhd and speech impediment crazy how that shit still effect meevery now and then ill be told that an acquaintance friend of a friend ha a crush on me which is flattering but it also very anxietyinducing it feel like im the object of someone attention that theyre hyper focusing on or hyperanalyzing me like im being inspected even if theyre not this get pushed even more if the particular woman ha an intense energy to her that can feel overwhelming when onanyone else feel anxious in a similar way or know how to cope,anxiety4338,i am not asking for a diagnosis in any way shape or form i want to see if anyone relates i wa diagnosed with avpd last year after taking this mental health test where someone call you and asks you yes or no question and if you arent sure they force you to pick a yes or no answeri am not convinced it is necessarily the correct diagnosis though and there are reason for that im not going to go into them in much detail  i just wonder if anyone else ever thought they were misdiagnosed too i read these two condition often get confused for each other i will say i can relate to feeling inferior and find rejection hurtful but i know those can be marker of social anxiety too idk i just dont think being forced into answering yes or no to question that have grey area is a good way to diagnose something the psychologist would also get on my nerve because he would say the test say you are like this and i would say no that is incorrect and he would go but the test say like that piece of paper knew me better than i knew me i have had such bad experience with therapist but ive been thinking about trying one more time and maybe getting another opinion i also want to say i do think social anxiety disorder can be just a profoundly harmful a avpd and it kind of suck that people think it is a lesser diagnosis it is not,anxiety4339,this is just a theory i have due to the symptom we all experience such a shaking and difficulty eating writing speaking in front of other people our disorder wa born out of one or two traumatic incident involving public humiliation or rejection of the highest degree when people like u get anxious we experience symptom that people without social anxiety dont experience such a shaking whenever i have mentioned this in front of a therapist they just bring up the flight or flight mechanism saying it just how our body reacts to threat but everyone get nervous but they dont necessarily shake it very rare i see it which lead me to believe we have symptom of or if not full blown ptsd but psychologist havent twigged thats what it is yet what do you think,anxiety4340,i cant believe im back on this subreddit again it feel like i havent posted here in age but ala im back at last i just felt like having a rant about my social anxiety yet againso i started university recently and ive been going for a few week now i cant say that ive been enjoying it so far ive found the lecture quite boring to be honest however ive hardly experienced any social anxiety at university unlike when i used to go to school during the first few week of uni i kinda just kept to myself and never talked to anyone in my lecture in fact this is embarrassing to admit but i dont even know the name of any of my classmate i remember seeing people with social anxiety complaining about how stressful university wa for them and not understanding them at all now i completely get itin today lecture i found out that were going to begin doing group work over the next few week i just hate group work it ha to be the one thing that trigger my social anxiety the most well it look like i might a well kiss my sanity and peace of mind goodbye dont be surprised if you see me posting more rant here in the coming week ,anxiety4341,im not sure why this is cause i dont think i really am a bitch i try to be a nice person and i think the best of people

tend to hang out in the private bedroom or basement while my husband is out for work but my fil seems to wish that i treat everybody like my own family i grew up emotionally neglected so it hard to imagine what family dynamic should be like with me included i never feel comfortable enough even though everybody tell me to treat this place like my ownmy husband got frustrated seeing me isolating all the time and insists that i owe them for their kindness by making my presence known in the house and talking he got mad at me while we were out telling me to get my shit together and it got me depressed for a bit a if i didnt know that i needed to do that either way im so stressed nobody truly understands and i cant afford therapy right now in the meantime how to slowly develop a relationship with my in law,anxiety4343,i dont remember the last time i forced myself to be comfortable in my own skin other than the excuse f these people what am i worrying fori had to progress to my current school one semester ago and my sa wa very heavily triggered when interacting with peoplelike that of a spidey sense tingling fast forward to now it quite minor but it still there though im doing well in resisting it for the most partit may have been due to a series of stumbling upon complete moron and thinking lowly about them it resulted to a growth mindset but with the thought that if this is how people are im so much better than them i can do better than thistime and time again i tried to convince myself otherwise but these people prove that i am better in term of moral ethic and now it seems intelligence i hate being complacent but i feel some people are looking down on me a guy for being timid and lonely and it piss me offis this relatable to you guy or am i turning into the worst possible man alive,anxiety4344,removed,anxiety4345,after almost a two year of recovering from binging all day i weighed  lb at  taking one shower every two month posting on incel forum

clothes i weari want to go into a more alt grunge aesthetic of clothing unfortunately that type of clothing is made fun of when youre a poc and suppose to be a heterosexual male worse part is people

or socially shutins to stop confining themselves and instead to step outside and interact the part that stuck out the most to me is where he insinuated that although the experience would be brutal and painful the end result would be highly highly worth it which made me thought a lot on my own experience doing it and what reflection did i gain nothing in fact after the video i only felt worse about my worthless self and kind of angry at solar himself for id undertaked the same course and in return received only more suffering and misery when i entered university  yr ago i wa determined to step out of my former highschoolself and tried to engage with everyone around me a much a possible thinking that the more i socialized the le socially inept i would become such wa the naivety however i still struggled to strike conversation and maintain them i didnt know what topic to talk about how to reply how to tease and joke around be it at school home on the street or at the workplace sometimes the pacing might get so fast that i couldnt even form a coherent and rational sentence in my mind let alone speaking them out like a yearold taking his first language lesson and sadly my wierd demeanor and isolated hobbiesinterests only further aggravated the situation in the end nothing improved i grew more and more isolated from everyone else people then saw me a if im some kind of bampot and started avoiding me talked behind my back and spread my reputation even more so than back when i wa in high school everyday going to anywhere wa an absolute torture with prying eye and behindtheback whispering it wa horriblethen came the pandemic which made everyone retreat back inside including me and do you know how i feel complete euphoria no more criticism no more ridicule no more agony at last getting back to being myself doing whatever the fck i want without any fckers judgement my mental health finally recovered and now im better than ive been in fact im pretty proud of

pollhttpswwwredditcompollyuep,anxiety4370,so i m wa never really a social person growing up not only because of the whole social anxiety thing but im also an introvert who get drained by social interaction plus i had a twin brother who shared all my interest so i never really felt the need to make new friend middle school wa the absolute worst for me regarding social interaction those were the year i wa actively trying to be an asshole because i didnt want to be like the popular kid they liked sport so i played video game they didnt pay attention during class so i tried to become the model student they laughed at crude joke so i convinced myself that i had a more sophisticated sense of humor i thought i wa better and more mature than everyone else just because i went against the grain but this attitude only got me ostracized by my classmate i hated everyone in my class and convinced myself they hated me just a much there were some people who actually tried to be my friend but i like an idiot pushed them away because i thought they just wanted to bully me even morewhen i got to high school i had one goal to make new friend the problem wa i wa so afraid of my high school year turning into a repeat of middle school that i never really put myself out there i just kind of hoped that people would approach me i wa friendlier with people though and did make a bit of an effort to talk to my classmate but there were still some i antagonized for being loud and annoying and for opening window in the middle of new jersey winter sufficed to say i never hung out with anyone outside of schoolcollege wa a lot better for me though while i still had trouble socializing with people actually in my class i did join a couple of tabletop game club because of dnd i wa actually able to make friend that i still interact with to this day sure i never went partying or bar hopping with these people but those weekly session were enough for me at the time i told myself that i didnt need to get into crazy hijinks or get in trouble for doing stupid shit but looking back i kind of regret not doing those thing ive heard your teenage and college year are the perfect time to take risk like that and the fact that i didnt make me feel like i wasted my youthim at a bit of a weird spot in my life where i feel like i should do something crazy and risky but at the same time i dont really want to i feel like i should grab some friend and party all night but i would rather stay in and play video game doe anyone else feel this way,anxiety4371,removed,anxiety4372,they

absent on ill have to ask my classmate about itthat wa in itself a problem for me because im in a totally new community i dont have any friend nor acquaintance and im sure i did not leave a good impression on anyone despite all that i wa pretty determined that ill just somehow cope with the thought that i will have to ask for it in the group chat during the weekendits now sunday almost half past seven in the evening serious procrastination a usual i anxiously open the group chat and thoughtfully rephrase my request like  time thinking about all the worst possibility that can happen if someone answer or doesntright before im about to send the text i notice one of my classmate asking a minor question what she sent at around a week ago at  she begin the text exactly a im sorry for the late disturbance not another classmate answered but the teacher himself an hour later what might be an insignificant detail but that freaked me out tooand now fucking what how am i to ask anything at this time sorry for the extremely late disturbance and just to mention im not about to ask some simple shit im asking for something that probably take time to tell so i doubt anyone would even consider helping this odd stranger in the evening who they now have a formal bond with to make it look more pathetic this took about half an hour to make so it now almost perhaps you who for some reason made it through this post are now thinking that im making too big of a deal out of this that this is the most pitiful problem youve seen in a long time that im laughably just wasting even more time writing a post about this and look maybe you are right but i just really cant im petrified of being made fun of being ignored or being idkmocked this is probably not the word i wa looking for sorry by the teacher for asking in an inappropriate way in an inappropriate time i wa never good at communicating especially with strangersthe title is an obvious exaggeration although i think about suicide at time i am sure i could never do it i wrote it almost right in the moment when i summed up my situation and i wa quite terrifiedim not even sure whats the point of sharing this like i think it is pretty damn late for advice but id appreciate any kind of feedback like if you got the slightest impulse of a thought while reading my first longer rant then i uh wholeheartedly encourage you to go on and type it down since it would really make the rest  hour of my day sorry for the awkward phrasing or flawed grammar not a native speaker,anxiety4375,my crush and i have a difficult

better part of a year he been wearing a virgin mary necklace he grew up in a religious family but he not a strict catholic like me i wear a virgin mary necklace all the time and when i met him i wa wearing it his necklace is very similar to mine he the type of person that wear different necklace depending on his outfit that day but he been wearing the virgin mary necklace for a little le than a

wa a good thing to start with some encouragement ive started doing it every day basically in any situation where i feel tired but still need to be productive or if i feel overwhelmed i actually have tried it twice before the first time it didnt work because i wa with a therapist i didnt believe in and the second time my mind raced to such an extreme extent that i felt insane and gave it up this time ive been keeping with it an it legitimately help i think it help more because i have looked at the study behind it and legitimately believe in it now it ha been proven to be a effective a some anxiety medication you know those never ending thought where you look back at a situation and cringe the kind where you just cant stop thinking about a badawkward situation and over analyzing it it helped with that i think i get it now meditation sort of train your brain to not react to harshly to thought or feeling in the moment since it specifically instructs you to just be aware of them without any judgement and then your mind go kind of blank and whatever you thought of doesnt matter a much then it help later when you have anxious thought and your mind ha been trained to let go of them idk this probably doesnt make any sense but yeah i would highly recommend meditation i cant wait to see how it will help me going forward since im seeing result this fast and prop to the people who encouraged me to try it out,anxiety4400,recently ive been getting into a lot of fight and debate on the internet i know i know it dumbbut then i took a moment today to critically analyze a heated conversation that happened to me the other night it wa on a public chat forum so i screenshotted and organized all the relevant message to help filter out the noise after reassembling them i realized that everyone i wa arguing with wa using logical fallacy andor straightup insult instead of actually contributing to the conversation and then when i understandably got upset it wa immediately flipped around on me a if i were the one who caused it lolim actually pretty glad this happened because it really help my belief that for once other people are the problem and it not just me ive been living in this world for year thinking that people hated me because i wa different because i wa rude or for some reason that i couldnt comprehend but then it hit me if i truly were the problem i would have zero good relationship right welli have five very close friend from different walk of life ive never had a major problem with any of them i also have a handful of acquaintences who seem to like me well enough and more often than not when i meet other people i know to be kind like friend of friend we get along just fineim going to try and remember that i am not the problem if other people lack the ability to critically think or be nice that isnt my fault im well liked by the people who are most important to me and thats all that matter i should really only care about what my closest friend have to say because theyre the one who know me best other than myself of course,anxiety4401,anyone done the program and noticed improvement in their social anxiety,anxiety4402,i just spent  minute writing a single text because i wa scared to come off a entitled or ride even though this person offered to help me and it physically made my stomach drop when i got a reply because sometimes i misinterpret their tone and what they say,anxiety4403,maybe this it just for me because it something ive struggled with a lot but ive come to realize that awkward moment are incredibly normal in social interaction and you should try to forgive yourself i went to a party today not a lot of people but i had  awkward moment i played a drinking game and spilled a lot of it on me because i poured too much in the cup when taking shot i said you too to the people who invited me when they said thanks for coming and in general i had a few awkward moment during conversation i wa also in my head about my appearance cause i struggle with that this is besides the point tho anyway just wanted to remind everyone here that awkward moment are part of social interaction thinking objectively about what happened at this party this is stuff that almost everyone ha probably done before anway i just got home not sure everything i said here make sense but you all get the gist be nice to urselves and goodnight,anxiety4404,i work in healthcare i am new to my field a year in a of the other day it wa important to me to make a good impression on people be polite give good report and it very important on me to be on people good side however from the start it wa clear that there wa no winning with some of the long timer who were kind of jaded and disliked any and all new people coming in however this one lady and i got on really well for perspective im in my mid s m and she is late s maybe  f she really helped me a lot weve chatted at length shared personal detail about thing like past relationship family etc weve helped each other at work and dont see each other very often at all but when we do it chatty cordial buddy buddy etc however the other night she mention something about facebook and take a picture of all of u and say something about a memory posted from last year i go to her fb to see what it wa and the pic she posted not only is she not on my friend list i cant find her at all im thinking did she block me no way shes been talking and laughing with me all night i said hey   are you even still on fb she responds huh and it hit me in the gut i repeat the question she say yeah without looking away from her phone i get home and logged into a different account sure enough there she is paste the link in the browser on my personal account and the this person is not available hoooly shit not only did she delete me she blocked me i will admit this messed with me really bad what the hell did i do nobody is obligated to me but i thought we had enough of a rapport to where if i saiddid something to offend her she could tell me shes been in a screaming match with another guy one time he wa at fault so i dont want to paint a misconception of her just being crazy or anything he a hot head but you cant tell me there something that happened you didnt like now i feel like a total dumb as because if i knew it wa like that i wouldnt be all buddy and chatty with you all shift id keep a friendly distance and keep it professional it just messed with me way more than i care to admit even though we werent necessarily close friend do i have some bad reputation at work im not aware of  it kept me up since honestly,anxiety4405,ill be laying in bed not realizing im super tense and ill try to relax and can feel my body trying to tense up again my therapist said it ha to do with anxiety like my body doesnt want to relax and want to be on guard ,anxiety4407,herehttpswwwtruitycomtestenneagrampersonalitytestppcgafixedampgclidcjkcqiapbbbhdyarisachhcsorrxnvgliccdywvoqakonrxudjknmcskbrddfaauwhealwwcb is the link for the personality test im type  wing ,anxiety4408,this isnt made for anyone to read but i just wanted to put this somewhere here is a social situation that i regretjust now i have been verbally screwed over by one of my friend in a short impromptu comedy battle and it felt absolutely devastating it wa through group text message and to put it lightly it really could have ended better for me in a nutshell he instigated the battle with a throw off joke that got drowned in the sea of other minuteold message never to be resurfaced which would have been the case hadnt i responded shortly after he replied back and steamrolled me i ended up surrendering and admitting defeat after not one but two failed comeback attempt from me and two successful and admittedly smooth killer jab from the other party after that i derailed the topic and we talked for a few more message just for the sake of my humiliating experience not being the last message that everybody else get to see it wa a group chat after all i spent some time later trying to compose myself after such an eventthroughout the whole ordeal i experienced a fairly high level of nervousness my leg got kinda shaky and i felt physically unstable and overly hesitant it lasted from my first response all the way to my futile submission and even a couple of minute after thati feel considerably bad about myself after thinking about the situation this wa just a random incident that didnt even last that long and i took it like a whole villain origin story really it wa so hard hitting that it got me motivated to write this i could have just not responded and let the message sink in but i just had to botch it all up by answering unprepared if you interpret it like that then it wa mostly my fault but to cut me some slack i dont have much experience in thing like these or social pressure situation especially in comparison so after a huge loss it wouldnt be such a surprise for me to feel like this but my main regret come from my terrible handling of my situation and the fact that i could have come up with way better thing to say had i given myself more time to think i came up with undoubtedly better answer literally second after typing them outother thing worthy of noting are that the friend i wa going up against ha a pretty edgy personality and sense of humor and i have beaten him before other time it just that he didnt end up a abashed a much a i did this time and we also have some kind of rivalry similar to a lawful v chaotic dynamic so that couldve been a big factor in my nervousnessi guess the lesson learnt here is that i really should keep my head cool and think before acting especially when im nervous or under pressure i could have either not responded the fact that it didnt cross my mind is really disappointing or alternatively i could have just given myself more time to think about what to answer and sharpen my wit for once in my life curiously a lot of mistake i made in my life come back to this but i dont think it because im not applying what i learnt i suspect it more of a lack of practice which is precisely the reason why i should get myself out of my comfort zone more and start getting into more comedy battle like these if i really want to improve maybe not to just avoid getting humiliated but to actually thrive in those scenario obviously to improve im gonna have to go through similar experience a lot more but thats part of the ridepersonally i still feel pretty bad about what happened but a lot le after i wrote this now it just the raw regret instead of all the confusion beforehand it feel so damn relieving having somewhere to put all of my messy thought in,anxiety4409,i talk to my therapist all the time how i cant get a close relationship with my friend no matter how much i try  she say i need to open up more and not hide so much but i have such a fear of opening up because when i do they use it against me and  humiliate me like i opened up about my toxic ex and how much trauma he brought me and she publicly embarrassed me about it in front of every one to win some stupid argument and how dumb i am for dating a guy older then me what do i share with people how much of closeness do i have to be to tell people personally stuff what is personally stuff how do i know they wont use it against me how do i know a friend like to be around me how do i tell person is even friend with me,anxiety4410,been a couple of month and while im a lot better than from when i first started i still feel really stressed out whenever i meet up with client especially when i have no idea how to answer their question because im relatively new and some of them get pissy when i have to redirect them to my superior i also worry alot about what to say or do in whatifs scenario and it very tiring whats a good mindset or practice to have to make this easier for me,anxiety4411,it infinitely harder to make friend a an  adult since i finished highschool ive slowly let friendship fall to the waist side i know it put a lot of pressure on my boyfriend that he basically my only friend i just dont know how to make friend without being forced into an environment with a person,anxiety4412,my new job requires me being thrust into something i have no experience with and i cant help but just feel like quitting it make me really anxious and i know i wont even be able to sleep properly either the fact that it lead to a career path im not interested in encourages my mind to be made up about quitting it make me shake and be anxious and i hate how it feel and how much i struggle to just move forward in life with this all of these team building activity and ice breaker for my job made me feel worse about myself among my coworkers because i seemed to be the most boring and awkward person there i dont want to do this,anxiety4413,im kinda an introvert wanting to be more extroverted but when i have a conversation with anyone friend or family all i have to say is  how are you then just odd silence can i have some conversation topic or advice specifically for a a good clever conversation with good laugh not just a boring conversation

saw someone who wa really cute our eye met they smiled at me and i smiled back i usually avoid eye contact and never smile in fear it might be taken the wrong way but i think next time it happens i might say hi or something but small step first right,anxiety4417,i feel so so alone i have boyfriend and family but they dont know how about my problem i feel so lonely and always cry alone i dont want to feel this way but if i told them about my struggle with social anxiety they would  think im crazy and will told me just to get over it im so depressed i dont know what to do i feel like i dont want to live but i also dont want to die,anxiety4418,doe anyone have this impression that people generally avoid talking directly or looking at you even when youre a member of the room they just addressed everyone else but somehow skipping over you eventhough youre right there like how do you get around this i think i smile enough to everyone but i dont know why im so unapproachable im too anxious to talk to people first btw and getting talked over skimmed through make me lose my confidence so much,anxiety4419,hey guysgirls i used to be charismatic and good with having social

going well and i actually people loved to be around me i see old chat all the time like those from last year or the year before and i say damn i wa good i really wish to have my skill personality and charisma back is there any possible way,anxiety4420,whether it a text social medium email i just cant stand it for some reason especially text i get so nervous when i see a text message notification popup and i catch a glimpse of what the person said and i immediately want to throw my phone into the ocean it like my brain unconciously expects the person to say something back to me within a time frame and when i dont expect it within that time i dont respond to them at all ,anxiety4421,we met on a dating app and were going to on the phone soon im working on exposure therapy but men are my biggest trigger and im not sure if ill be ready for this tbh but i would also like to be in a relationship so i dont know what i should doi keep having what if thought like what if there awkward silence or what if i dont know what to sayi need advice on what i should do if this doesnt go well im afraid it will probably ruin my mental health for a bit a dramatic a that sound,anxiety4422,in my past guy have stopped talking to me after hooking up not intercourse and now im really anxious after sexual experience w a guy im dating i feel like hell stop liking me now and we didnt even have sex ,anxiety4423,people with social anxiety disorder often work in occupation far below their talent because of their extreme social fear many would rather work in an unrewarding job with limited social demand than deal with social situation every day so true tho,anxiety4424,removed,anxiety4425,i have a strong history of good hard work i do struggle with my confidence but i really do bring result and impress my professional peerslast month i wa fired from my job bc i got scammed the company ha a zero tolerance policy so the district manager wa forced to tearfully let me go apologizingthis isnt the first time ive been fired also for a small mistake the good thing wa that it happened the day before covid lockdown wa announced so i took advantage of the layoff not all interview ask why you left your last jobthis past job i finally accepted a promotioni applied to  job at once and wa contacted almost immediately by  of them there are other option but theyre last resort i dont think theyre a great fit i have had the interview for those  job i havent heard back yet and my anxiety is ramping up bracing for rejectionthat and difficulty asking for help finance are hitting harder than i expected since inflation ha hit store i love sub but jj is  for a giant sub i looked at sliced meat to make my own sub and salami is freaking  per packagei remind myself i can make it through this ive done it before,anxiety4426,so i wa recently added to a dampd group chat on snapchat and im confused to how it work i get notification of people talking and snapping one another is it ok if i just view the snapsmessages without really replying apparently people can see that you viewed their snap,anxiety4427,besides the most obvious one someone you know irl finding iti actually made a new friend through reddit but today they suddenly deleted their accountthey didnt post anything and their last comment wa made  month agoso im assuming i made them feel embarrassed somehow the only thing i can think of wa that i mistook them for female but we just laughed it off and i said im still glad to have met themi just dont get what i did wrong they reminded me so much of my old friend i feel actually kinda sad,anxiety4428,i tend to think that boredom is the root of many of our issue if we had a better life system where our life path could be more engaging we would have le time to ruminate or dwell on our fear and anxiety take a look at people who still live traditionally in tribal settlement they are so busy they dont even consider killing themselves they cannot believe it even happens in city far away from them so the name of the game is keeping yourself occupied what i find best is combining multiple hobby like using insight from one hobby to amplify another thats a good way to generate good content for reddit which affords you one more opportunity to practice socializing,anxiety4429,is anybody else embarrassed to talk about their struggle with sa i feel like people who are close to me dont really see this side of me so theyre surprised when i tell them how much i struggle with social situation for example i went to a party recently in a bar and i spent an hour hiding in the bathroom with my earphone in because it got too much i cant tell anybody this because i find it humiliating that i cant just relax and enjoy myself,anxiety4430,for example last year when invited to a friend birthday dinner where she wa the only person i knew i arrived with an appetite a soon a i walked into the restaurant and realized i would have to face her friend and try to engage in conversation the appetite disappeared it an instantaneous feeling of being full and the smell of any strong food began to make me nauseous this isnt the first or last time this happened i had to excuse myself because the sound of all the chatter surrounding me and my friend asking do you like the food since i wa only picking at it in piece just made it worse if anyone else deal with this how do you cope,anxiety4431,i wa getting red and about to sweat too i noticed him staring two time one directly at me and another time he wa staring at me through the glass window when people actually see me get anxious is probably the worse part of having social anxiety i just wish my physical symptom werent noticeable,anxiety4432,doesnt matter whether im working on an essay or writing a comment on the internet i always feel like i have to put in maximum effort and do something the right way even though logically i know i dont i cant even pick up a video game i used to play because i feel pressured to be at the same level of progression i used to be,anxiety4433,im so damn alone we used to talk all the time but over the last few month he barely said a word to me he didnt text me for a month and then on my birthday said a casual happy birthday and that wa thati always text him and try to see how he doing and he either give me halfassed response or doesnt

girlfriend because she wa invited to a friend birthday she thought that we were going to a bar or a restaurant to chill but we ended up in this big as shitty party with loud music i knew no one there

head for  year trying to figure way to deal with anxiety when it come to talking and approaching ppl to socialize i seem to have a breakthrough and having tested it i have had great improvement in dealing with iti want to see if this could help other people also to deal with it the solution is suppose to permanently fix it instead of using something a a bandage only to wake up every day and feeling the same dreaded churning in the stomachif you feel like you want to be part of this please dm,anxiety4476,in a very weird situation that i keep obsessing over and am having trouble getting overso basically i had a talking stage with a guy when i wa  he wa the first guy that ever liked me im super shy after  month i decided to end thing with him bc i wasnt interested anymore and wanted to move on it wa difficult for me because i had real feeling involved so i immediately went no contact and deleted all of my social medium i have never had a guy be into me before and had very little social experience i honestly didnt think that hed care apparently he cared a lotokay so here the thing he never explicitly told me he cared ever he never called me or texted me but apparently he told multiple people that i led him on and hurt him i also called him a couple of month later while i wa at a new school that i missed him and then decided that maybe we shouldnt talk because i wa moving to texas later that month again he never texted me back or called or anything but he like tell a lot of people apparently that i keep leading him on and i also think he tell people that i cheated on him and some other thing it pretty weird because it been two year since this happened and i havent had any romantic interest since then im like a huge loner but i think it easy for people to assume otherwise bc im like decently attractive i guessbut i think that people from my home town really hate me for some reason because of this just a vibe that im getting idk it weird because i wa never engaged or married to the guy or anything like what i wa  i wanted to end thing so i did it still a thought that hold me hostage because i literally have so few social experience that the fact that people perceive me in this weird way make me feel so uncomfortable like i ob over it sometimes and let it ruin my day,anxiety4477,i feel like i could handle my sa if all i had to deal with wa the anxiety in my mind but my physical symptom have gotten so bad over time my heart rate go through the roof my body shake my voice quiver i also have a new fun symptom where my head will shake when a bunch of people are looking at me i lose my train of thought instantly my intelligence doesnt matter because my anxiety rip it out of me the moment the spotlight is on mei just had to fake a zoom call cutting out and hang up because my voice wa cracking and shaking so bad in a zoom call in front of our open office life feel so hopeless and there is no way out or a way to fix it ive never met a person in my life like me everyone else is normal and can function like they are suppose to and just get shit done except mei really do not know what to do i cant go on having these soul crushing experience i gamble with the lottery constantly for hope that one day i can have money to support myself and just sit in solitude at home away from the expectation of societyi truly feel le than human it is demoralizing to a degree i cant put into word i dont know what the purpose of this post is but i just had to get this off my chest and see if someone feel the same way thanks,anxiety4478,so basically without realizing that i had social anxiety i have suffered from this exact symptom for over  year nowi thought i had hyperhidrosis ocd adhd and whatnot but the only thing i suffer from is social anxietyno matter how cold it is once i step outside my back get wet then my front no matter how hard i try to stay composed i just cant help but sweat all my cotton garment are in unusable condition because of this how many time a day can you wash them reallythe heating continues till i reach home the longer i stay outside the more miserable and helpless i feel in this precarious statenote  i somehow lose my ability to talk normally once i am heated up which i do every single time it affect my brain in mysterious way where i fail to register whats being taught in schoolcollegecoaching my brain go numb my eyesand lip feel dry i cant even shut my eye in this stategoes without saying my academic have suffered horribly after primary school i have always questioned myself why i cant understand anything in class this is the reason i am just freaking out so much without knowing that the stuff being taught go over my head it render me to a state where i fail to do anything not just study,anxiety4479,whoever invented mobile pick up order i love you,anxiety4480,when i wa like  going out and getting drunk wa like my favourite thing ever ive always been socially anxious and leaning towards introverted but i just really enjoyed doing this however im  now and the past few year ive just not enjoyed it that muchi think obviously my age is part of the reason for that i am getting older and the excitement of drinking isnt a intense and i dont feel the need to do it a my only source of fun anymore but i think another big reason is because i dont have any close friend up until i wa  i had close friend but i dont really anymore i think having them with me when going out is kind of part of why it wa so funive been in  relationship since i wa  a well and i know that always affect your desire to go out but the thing is my best friend is coming to visit me in  week and i am so excited to go out with her i mean not a excited a i wouldve bene at  but im just really excited to spend time with her and have some drink and have a laughyet tonight im going out with a group of people and i just really dont want to go it my boyfriend friend birthday and there gonna be like a group of  it doesnt help that theyre also all like  and still very party mode and all do drug which make it harder to feel comfortable around themi wasnt even meant to go out tonight a there a meal planned and his friend parent were paying for it so i couldnt come a i dont have money but someone bailed so they asked if i wanted to come my boyfriend wanted me and i also felt like i couldnt say no cause i already declined with the reason that i couldnt afford iti really want to want to go but i just dont and i know im gonna get comment saying just dont go then but it not a simple a that i get very worried about people judging me or thinking im being rude and i already feel like all his friend feel that way about me since i dont hang out with them much so i really dont want to look rude by declining then saying im coming then declining again plus my boyfriend want me to come and i want to make him happy a he is more social than me and compromise a lot by not going out a lot anymorei just wish i could want to party like i used to i just feel so awkward and shy and tired,anxiety4481,removed,anxiety4482,i stare people with corner of my eye and i got zero control on it people notice it a huge problem some girl think im in love with them some other girl think im an pervert and some boy think i have a beef with them i know why it started like a month ago after some people talk bad behind my back even they know i can hear them i didint knew how to deal with it so i started feeling so insecure about it i think my conscious try to defend itself and look everyone how can i overcome this,anxiety4483,so ever since i wa a child ive been extremely introverted in primary school ive only ever really had a few friend at a time who i would play with every lunch and break time the majority of my friendship would be on and i actually felt happy with this and never felt the need or want for a large group ive never fared well in group of people literally ever since i wa born a a child i didnt really care a i loved my on friendship if people i didnt really know joined our conversation i would just stop talking and wait until they were gone now im older i realised that this wa extremely rude  behaviour and i definitely should not have done it if i wa one of the people joining the conversation and someone acted like that towards me i would dislike them too the thing is is that i wa genuinely born like this attempting to socialise fit in with big group ha always made me feel uncomfortable and bored my antisocial personality led a lot of people especially the loud people to dislike me if i tried to talk to them many would pull a disgusted face and walk away some girl in the year above would even laugh at me and mock me if i walked by them thus the beginning of my social anxietyas i got older i realised that this kind of anti social behaviour wa a serious problem a being able to socialise well is important for basically everything i realised that i get on great with almost everyone when there only  of u total but a the group get bigger everything crumbles thank you for reading this long rant over the year ive tried and tried to change but it so hard looking back i have made a lot of improvement but the underlying discomfort when talking in group ha never left what im trying to say is that i am not blaming others and im completely at fault for other people hating me im just so tired of trying to change to fit in with a world that work so differently to me,anxiety4484,for last few year ive been trying to get into more social situation i thought if ill be ok in enough of them ill have le and le anxiety because my brain will slowly learn to associate socializing with something le threatening all i got out of this so far is that i feel worse physically i get nauseous and i have to put a lot of energy into trying to ignore it and not worrying that maybe i really am sick this time sometimes i even didnt expect ill feel bad so it not like im preparing for the worst so just worrying about that make me feel worse one time i even had trouble eatingand i didnt do anything embarrassing most of the time so why am i not learning to be anxious if everything go well i feel more confident and i associate socializing more with feeling physically bad than just feeling anxious so why tf doe this happen why do i get punished for making a little mental progress with this and can it get worse,anxiety4485,at school i try my best to avoid sitting with my friend in class yes i somehow have a small circle of friend though i am not very close with anyone of them whereas everybody else in my friend circle is close with at least one person so we are just talking about good friend herei always feel so relieved when i sit with a classmate i am not close with preferably one who doesnt talk alot because then i dont have to worry about talking to them but a part of me deep down feel left out and empty watching everyone else getting alongi sometimes hope my friend would just leave me alone in particular situation but then i act salty towards them when they do leave me behindi feel like sitting alone in class when i am sitting with a friend and then feel super lonely when i do end up sitting aloneits like a part of me want to hangout and is all lively but a part of me want to just shut up and act like people dont even exist it just wanting to be there and not wanting to participate i push people away because of my own insecurity and then complain for their lack of attention and interest in me,anxiety4486,i used to work remotely and i love it so much now i am presencely working and i used to have an office without coworkers so afterwards i wa a bit comfortable with it i could handle going to eat in the kitchen and being a little more socialbut now i am working in another office and i have this coworkers  male and they are nice but is just i dont know how to break the ice i dont know what to say bc i always had female friend one of the thing uncomforts me is that they always have others coworkers who are very noisy and they have a lot of confidence like best friend and start to talk or make funny between them and i am the only female there so i feel like an alien and the most akward girl one of their friend were in love with me but i dont like and thing with him is akward so when i saw him i feel with more anxiety lol i wish i have other jobso the thing is i often use my earphone and this way i can focus in my thing and dont listen them but i feel like im  avoiding the situation and im being more asocial  how could i break the ice im too quiet and have so different personality,anxiety4487,i have known her for i think a month now shes my classmate she wa the one who started talking to me at first it wa really awkward but but i managed to talk to her and since then we became friendsit get awkward every now and then tho i really wanna go but im scared that it will be awkward because it will be the first time we meet outside of school im really scared i havent even opened her text yet i dont know what to tell her any advice on how to not make it awkward,anxiety4488,wa it genetic or acquired from life  ive read that sad doesnt have a genetic component  it learned behavior from people close to u  but if thats the case  then why do many people who were bullied  neglected  rejected simply not care or move on with life while having other problem like anger issue or other coping mechanism  what do you think caused your social anxiety  what were you lacking in your childhood that made you feel so inferioroutcast,anxiety4489,i have been bawling my eye at the thought of convocation ceremony due in one month the course i signed up for wa

general class together with a really good professor shes rated  on ratemyprofessor and there nothing but good message about herit all sound perfect but i worry that my friend are not the best influence theyre known to get off track and focus on hanging out a lot because their schedule are very flexible for their major i kinda dont want to be in the same class because i worry that ill get distracted plus since theyre pretty much attached at the hip i worry that i will just be another third wheel there is another option available at the same time however the professor is new and there no data of him on ratemyprofessor so i cannot tell if he a good one or not i feel comfortable knowing that i will be able to study at my own pace and have more free time for myself taking it alone rather than taking it with friend however he seems completely new and there absolutely no data on him so i worry he might not be the best teacher my major is pretty much work heavied ive already ran to my friend about how busy my schedule get but they always seem to shrug it off a if it not a big deal or if i decide not to hang out with them theyll treat me differently compared to others should i take the new teacher class is it worth it passing up on a good professor,anxiety4498,technically i didnt even get it one of my friend got it for me i dont really know what to do like do i try and strike a conversation or do i send a selfie orrr what would we even talk about ive never been the best or even remotely good at social situation so any advice,anxiety4499,at a church campa guy  approached me then we talked and got to know each other and texted each other online after texting online we met again but i guised avoid him because of my overriding sa expecting him to talk to me first which also never happened i go back online to talk to himnext thing you know he block me on insta i must admit being abit awkward on the first encounter but im still abit confused he is around  yr older than me and potentially looking for a gf even his sister told me he liked me and tried to get u together  anyone can think of solution to explain this ,anxiety4500,i have spent so long putting up a facade just so that i can make friend interact with my peer and seem likable all in all i dont know who i truly am any more and ive never felt this confused about anything ever,anxiety4501, one of the thing that really hold me back when im in a conversation or trying to get close with people is the fact that im really underdeveloped socially and im a late bloomer i havent gotten a chance to have a lot of experience that people have had and there are some thing i dont do that most people do i always feel like a loser compared to other people and i feel like people probably think im boring and weird my parent are strict and had been while i wa growing up and a an adult i get scared to do these thing because of guilt from growing up with strict parent i still live at home so thats a big part of it too i know these are thing that i have to fix on my own so im not complaining im just wondering if these thing are actually going to hinder me from finding friend because right now im really insecure over how i am and im wondering if i should even be insecure in the first place for context for all these im a  year old girlive never been to a party other than like a birthday party ive never been to any bar or club and i dont drink personally i dont have any strong urge to start drinking alcohol but in context of social situation it feel weird when i hear people talk about alcohol and getting drunk because i have no idea what thats like i would like to do it one day but it kind of hard to right now anyways being that i live at home and also dont have any friend to go withive never been in a relationship had a first kiss nothing this mainly came from having strict parent a a teenager and i had a couple of people want to kiss me and for one i wanted to but i wa so nervous in that moment so i said no lmao but now a an adult im just really insecure and im not really looking to date though i feel stressed out a bit because time is ticking but for some reason i suddenly feel like im not ready which i know sound really odd i think it mainly because i believe im so socially underdeveloped and i feel like im terrible at talkingi dont swear that often my parent actually didnt care about this one but for some reason it just never came naturally to me if i do swear it doesnt feel like it sound right unless im feeling really angry or passionate about something i dont care if other people swear at all i just for some reason feel weird doing it myself i remember in high school people used to make a big deal about it if i ever did and would say thing like but youre so innocent if i did and it used to really annoy me like why do i have to be put into this box of being innocent and other people donti dont really go out and do thing unless it with my parent this one really bug me and im actively trying to change it so far ive started small and i go out to the library to work on stuff to coffee shop etc but when im talking to people it a problem because everyone else ha thing that they did on the weekend and if i didnt go anywhere with my parent i have nothing to talk about im still getting used to the feeling of just going out on my own and making plan for myself i think i have this internalized guilt like it a waste of money time gas etc to just go out for no reason other than to just enjoy myself also im so used to going out with parent or friend when i had them that i just dont get how people go out on their own like thatanother big one that worry me is the fact that i dont have friend again a lot of people talk about their friend and what they do with them i feel like people see it a a red flag when you dont have friend whether it is or not i know that the reason why i dont is because im so insecure and dont put myself out in social situation enough i used to have friend all throughout my childhood up until i wa  but i just got so self conscious and bad a socializing that it became hard im ready to try again though but it just feel like a catch  when you cant make any friend because people think youre weird for not having anyso those are the five biggest example i could name but there just a lot of other thing about me that make me feel so different from people my age like even down to my hobby i feel like theyre a lot more childish compared to other people i like to draw and play video game which i feel like might sound lame to other people i have a job but i find it really boring and difficult for me to talk about my job and my experience working there with other people just thing like that in my mind this is one of the big reason why i cant make friend and i just want other people opinion on if maybe thats correct,anxiety4502,before  always been very shy and quiet only a few friend i wa comfortable with  social anxiety at it peak i had no friend at school and got bullied feared walking around people feared moving my hand and people would judge my every more wa certainly afraid to speak to anyone at all thinking the guy at the grocery store will judge my hello or my weird shaky and awkward movement  i wa still afraid of being judged for my every move but i started being braver talking to some people and saying a few word despite being very robotic and terrified i wa very depressed and never knew what wa wrong with me slight improvement from  despite social anxiety i wa learning how to become mentally stronger also i learned how to fake a good posture make eye contact even if forced social anxiety wa still there from overthinking every word and interaction i didnt feel any connection with anyone i used to feel like i wa putting on another persona i felt the need to talk just to hide my shyness a i wa highly ashamed of it well at least i started talking more and realizing it wasnt a scary a i thought  similar to  however at the start of  i worked at a place where i had to talk to customer it helped a lot despite being terrifying at first i used to walk to work sometimes for the first time i started gradually being comfortable walking alone in public that wa a major change i started to enjoy it i realized that many creepy men would stare not because they are judging my personality or movement negatively but because they are disgusting creep  much better than before i left home and started uni it wa an opportunity for me to make a lot of small talk with people on campus still had a hard time making good friend though i used to overthink so badly still better overthinking social situation became le severe than previously  this wa the time when i got so comfortable with many people acquaintance people le than friend but more than acquaintance well at uni it wa relatively easy to talk to people especially in club or team oh i still would get anxiety for example if i were to hang out with someone far from uni  unfortunately thing start to go downhill i regret this part well i did graduate but i got into a bad relationship and became isolated anyways my social anxiety ha awakened again also due to my fear of acting in way that he wont like and him disliking my outgoing self and wanting me to be shy also covid started i moved elsewhere to another place well starting a new life and during midcovid i wa busy with trying to get my life together i broke up with him despite being away from him for a year at the end of  i wa trying to get out of the isolation talking to coworkers and guy wa still anxiety inducing but in a different way from social anxiety it wa more related to the fear my ex implanted in me oh not to mention the new culture i knew nothing about  i gradually started to detox from my ex and tried to find myself again i also cut him off completely a we were still friend i had my fair share of ups and down i dated a decent guy this time but then we broke up well after the breakup i took a leap and started to put myself out there again well a an adult and not being in a place like uni where people my age are surrounding me  it is harder i did manage to hang out with a couple of stranger i joined a couple of group i am trying to be more friendly with people in general trying to overcome my social anxiety again and my other fear that my ex implanted in me for the past  month or so i have been exposing myself to more people or even going out with them sometimes i didnt make friend yet a the last one wa my nd ex we started off a friend i still am socially anxious but at least i am kind of getting back nearly the level of healing i attained at  before it get disrupted  well thing i am not anxious doing at  at least the level is low or very controlled going out alone eating alone in public basically being alone in public not being afraid people judge my move in fact i started to kind of like when people look at me and feel confident ordering thing some phone call to schedule appointment talking to some customer service people etc doing something with people in a group or club going to the gym alone still anxious to highly anxious when i hang out with people for the sake of hanging out be it new people or people i know some i feel like there is pressure on me like if i talk to a coworker at work for the sake of work or a quick small talk i might feel fine or slightly anxious only because i am there only to work and there are no expectation but if were to hang out with them somewhere outside of work my anxiety start to skyrocket ahead of timeoh i am even terrified of contacting a person i hung out with like  time to hang out with me again and it my turn this time to ask her i just cant for some reason this ha been very terrifying and i want to avoid it,anxiety4503,before i begin im not diagnosed w anything but im not able to explain why i felt what i did so i came here for answer possibly so our uni held a sort of event where you could get rose delivered to people anonymously or with your name these group of guy said that someone sent a rose for me i didnt belive them i wa with my friend x at the time my friend wa like let go see what theyre talking about and i said theyre just joking so leave it but they werent i wa actually sent a rose there wa so much attention on me and now people knew i got a rose and it made me feel so uncomfortable i then realised that it wa x who sent it they do stuff like this a a friend though not romantically i wa restless the whole lecture and ran out and met them in the bathroom i gave them the excuse of it being too expensive and they shouldnt have wasted the money on me but in reality i fucking hated the attention and this gesture is such a nice fucking gesture and so so sweet so tell me why did i cry in the bathroom why were my hand shaking why wa i so uncomfortable with something thats supposed to be sweet,anxiety4504,i dont know why but im terrified of getting gasoline and driving ive been driving a lot but im just terrified,anxiety4505,i like the idea of the weekendthe reality is you work five day a week and then the weekend are full of houseworki wa bullied relentlessly between the age of five and fourteen ive lived my whole life without friend ten year after that i got depression and i wanted people in my life four year later im still alonewhere the fuck do you begin making friend and why nowive only been in love once and it wasnt mutual it blew up in my face someone back then told megtthere are so many people out there that would absolutely adore you so please dont waste your time on people who wont feel the same way you do  gt  gtjust because shes not there for you doesnt mean noone else isi want to know what that person wa smokingive heard it all beforegtyou shouldnt need anyone to complete you you can love yourselfsure but i guarantee you noone who say that ha to actually live like that to make friend im going to have to go out alone at least once but honestly id rather die than do that and it probably wont even help i went to university for three year and i put myself out there and where did it get me besides even if i wanted to im going to be busy with housework,anxiety4506,non socially anxious people see opportunity of hanging out with people to be generally fun and relaxing or a way to form possible new connectionswell to me there is no difference between an evaluatedgraded performance of some sort or public speaking in front of a large crowd im assuming the majority of people get nervous in these situation to some degree to me i start worrying about my performance i start hoping i wont be too boring and tired and that i will be at my best energy wise my fun self i feel nervous before it wishing i could cancel but then remembering how i should expose myself telling myself i can do it afraid i will perform badly or be too quiet or anxious and give the person the wrong impression when i am anxious i come off a involuntarily intimidating cold and not interested then during i start grading myself i am doing well or i am not doing so well i should have said that instead of this i should have been a little more friendly or i should have laughed le etc oh while simultaneously reminding myself that all this is social anxiety and telling myself keep going you can do this then im like well if i know that this is social anxiety why cant my brain just ease out and make sense of thing and just stop the anxiety to all those people who say thing like it all in your head no it not like that and then i remember that trying to fight the anxiety make it worse so i tell myself it ok to feel anxious and to feel the way you do just accept it sometimes i end up feeling overwhelmed and numb afterwards and needing like a day or  if not more to unwind and get back to normal not to mention the overthinking that happens afterwards i could have done this better here oh i wasnt myself a much because of anxiety did the other person notice is that a turn off did they think i am weird but then after it done it feel like a relief yeah basically socializing equal doing some sort of difficult exam that your life depends on my social anxiety ha become more situational and ha gotten much better over time but the intensity is still high when it doe kick in also despite feeling all of the overwhelm and drain i can feel the difference significantly later on i am enjoying my alone time better than when i wasnt socially connected i figured that despite the way i feel my body and mind do take into consideration that my need for socializing ha been met haha,anxiety4507,i am an art student and these day a project ha been eating my mind so my friend and i were invited to a bday party although i wasnt in my best mood i decided to force myself to go with them and have fun who know maybe that would be the party i will always remember or i will meet new interesting people or i will just take the pressure offas it turn out i tried to make some small talk in the begining but i just didnt want to hear the answer or to think what to talk about so while my friend were having fun i just couldnt force myself to do the same my friend tried to cheer me up and even other people tried to talk to me and i just couldnt give a funny or nice response i just blocked myself couldnt enjoy it or try to force me to get out of my confort zone and talk to others i just wanted to leave and crynow i dont understand wa it my fold for not trying hard enough should i not go if i dont feel like it naturally a more introverted shy and anxious person i feel so bad that my friend had to be preoccupied for me and not annoying the party with me although i went to party in the past and had fun,anxiety4508,she told me that im either going to live like this forever if i dont try or get better if i do try how the fuck am i supposed to do this when my first reaction to a lot of thing is to just start cry and internally suffer while everyone around me can socialize normally like sorry i dont want to do a lot of these challenging thing because they make me feel like fucking shit yes even the baby step and i get it i get that i have to try too but damn every time i think about it i just wanna cry man i want my old self back,anxiety4509,she did it twice with flash on but i couldnt say anything and didnt speak up because maybe she took a snap with her shoe or something but when she took the second one a double

have never been totally alone i have always had friend and i preserve my best friend from my childhood however my social circle ha always been very limited and we agree on very few hobby about four year ago my situation improved to interact with others began to be easier for me although anxiety never went away in  i started university and i wa excited to meet people with who to coincide in hobby and topic of conversation but soon i wa disappointed we did not attend class normally due to covid and the few day that i could go to class in person i wa very nervous i tried to talk to some people but my behavior wa not spontaneus because i wa extremely worried about make a good impression the second year the class began to be totally in person but social anxiety had worsened i felt terribly frustrated because i did not understand and still i dont understand it why all the advance of the last few year had disappeared i wa very bad psychologically i also had other problem i missed class and when i went i wa permanently restless and too selfconscious the few time that someone spoke to me i became excessively nervous and even my voice trembled im mentally better now i attend class normally and in general i am comfortable there however i dont talk to anyone at all and i feel that it already late because all the group of friend are formed im more relaxed and i think i could have a minimally fluent conversation the problem is that i dont know how to start it im afraid that people will think im ridiculous for trying to implicate after being silent for two year and avoiding contact with them rationally i am aware that if i dont try i will continue the same but the simple idea of being ignored block me this situation frustrates and depresses me because i feel like university is the last chance i have to find friend and im wasting it every day there are people in front of me talking about thing that interest me expressing problem and opinion with which i identify even expressing the same passion that i feel for some thing but i dont know how to intervene in conversation without seeming am i butting in or am i the weird guy speaking up after two year of silencein short i dont know how to suddenly start a conversation when im in my third year of university,anxiety4513,this semester i began teaching a a group fitness instructor in cardio dance at

they think i am when someone i meet seems to like me and we become friend i wonder how long itll take them to change idea about me eventually theyll realize im not who they thought i wa and theyll lose interest in me or worse theyll hate me this is why i have to carefully weigh every word i say before saying it every interaction or text message it so

industry which wa terrifying because i had to interact with stranger all day which wa and is my nightmare over the next few year i felt like i had worked through my social anxiety or at least gotten it under control because i wa constantly exposing myself to my fear i no longer felt like it had control over me like i wa paralyzed from it year ago i packed up my shit and moved to paris i knew beforehand it wa going to be difficult but i never though it would still after over  year be so difficult to get by socially it feel like all of my social anxiety came back all at once  like i have to

managed to become a lot more open at least to the point where i wa able to get a lot of good friend during uni year and even overcome the fear of presenting in front of people to some extent but for some reason talking in discussion ha stayed a giant hurdle for meadding to this the fact that im pressured by my parent to finish my bachelor a fast a possible and that people around me poke fun at me for not being able to talk ha added a lot of stress in my life and i dont really know what to do anymore i basically keep the current situation in this class a secret from everyone have any of you had

highschool by calling my phone due to my social anxiety i wanted to be alone and didnt know how to end the friendship so i just ignored countless call over a long time until they stopped i know it not

since i realize my social anxiety is not minimal and is still making me uncomfortable affecting many aspect of my daytoday lifefirst time i did cbt  my then therapist never even mentioned medication this time third session and this new therapist suggested this a he think medication in combination with cbt ha the best result for someone like me who feel overwhelmed in social situation to the point he can fully operatenow i am facing a dilemma  should i take the med and give it a try or is this therapist not skilled enough to treat my case i am also worried about how med are going to work any advice from people who have had similar dilemmasdoubtsexperiences,anxiety4534,wa this ever a way to deal with sa for you,anxiety4535,sometimes with some people if i feel like i am performing well because i often rate my social performance and grade myself during and after i feel like my social anxiety decrease a bit with those people a if i passed an exam or something and feel relieved on the other hand if i am with people with whom i am the quiet one my social anxiety go to the roof i start overthinking my quietness and how i am coming across i start by critiquing myself a the quiet one and remembering all the time when i wa the quiet one in the past it true i am an adult now but i feel like being the quiet one when i wa younger and the negative experience i had with it have for some reason left their impact on me badly then i wonder if i should speak just to say something and not appear quiet well when i do so i end up putting on a show and feel like i am not being true to myself and i end up unhappy and feel like i am a robot with no feeling here are some thing if i do feel like saying something with people but i am scared to in this scenario i do manage to just say it and then i feel good about it especially when i get positive feedback from others i have done this a lot over the year and it had paid off to a large extent  there are time when i feel like being quiet in a group i start worrying so much about it i start feeling numb and then worthless and like a nothing i get drained i even start associating my self worth with being the useless quiet weak one on the bottom of the hierarchy while this may be true in middle school it doesnt apply now and i am aware that people dont think of me like that but i just cant shake off the anxiety today i thought about something i am trying to discern between whether they are the wrong people or it is just my anxiety then i wa like well people without social anxiety if they hang out with people who arent compatible with them theyll probably just feel it and thats about it but they wont experience a huge overwhelm and get super anxious i also realized this it okay to be the quiet one if i feel like being quiet sometimes this group is talking about thing that i dont have anything to add to and is not my topic of interest i do enjoy listening though it okay if i am quiet when i see someone quiet i dont think of them any le easier said than done i would get all panicky if i am quiet i dont have to fake saying thing just to not be quiet i want to be myselfi dont know i want to try to accept the quiet side in me sometimes i talk a lot but sometimes i am really quiet and fine about it anxiety aside doe anyone relate or experience something similar,anxiety4536,i have a job interview next week and i honestly dont think i will be able to do it i already messed up numerous time when they called me ive never been to a job interview before i feel like i may a well not waste their time by doing the interview and just tell them now that i realised i am not a good fit it doesnt help that this job actually requires social skill and they probably expect candidate to be normal,anxiety4537,since i wa told i have resting bitch face ive been smiling when i make eye contact with someone to try and come off a more approachable however people only smile back or even contort their face in anyway like  in  time and i end up feeling like a retard when i smile at them and they just keep scowling is this a waste of time,anxiety4538,apparently these are really dangerous diet must be followed to a tee or you can fucking die but can also be super effective for people that have treatment resistant social anxiety ive tried a lot of ssri and im thinking about trying to talk a doc into letting me try something like nardil the diet is super restrictive but i would really give up almost anything to feel normal did these work for anybody,anxiety4539,i have trouble keeping boundary around my coworkers because im desperate to rebuild previous close relationship ive had i also want them to think im laid backedgycoolwhatever super lame ik sometimes it easy to forget that theyre my coworkers because we talk about nonwork related thing and hang out outside of workyesterday it wa myself and  guy at lunch i wa nervous and wa trying to stay cool we had an interesting and somewhat philosophical discussion so an image in my mind popped up that it wa like we were in a blunt circle wtf ik but this is relevant a we were leaving the table someone said we should all meet up at the bar and talk about this again i wa like oh yeah im sure alcohol will make this better which elicited some laugh then i said or this making motion like i wa smoking weed ah nevermind i wa kidding but im not sure if it came across like that to everyone one person said yeah or that i have no idea if anyone else noticed because we were all in different stage of getting up and walking away it didnt hit me until after that that might have been too muchnobody ha treated me differently but i cant stop ruminating that they all secretly think im unprofessional and a druggie or whatever i also mentioned im not doing anything for thanksgiving so i also sounded like a loseri did another stupid thing around the same people at a bar a couple month ago and i believe it also said negative thing about me what make it worse is that im attracted to one of them and he wa there for both of these event im afraid hell never respect me i wish i could stop embarrassing myself every single time i interact with people i want to hide but also feel the need to be around and impress them to try to redeem myself after every interaction no matter how good i ruminate and tell myself that i wa so cringy and selfabsorbed and stupid this cycle is so exhausting but i feel like it my fault for trying too hard,anxiety4540,it always stress for me when i am with other people i always look around try to act normal try to copy the behaviour of others but it just always feel like exhausting work and i dont get how people can enjoy being with other for hour somehow i am afraid i miss a fundamental and natural experiencejoy of life by avoiding these situation,anxiety4541,ive noticed that most of the time the recruitermanager at those establishment is a bossy female who try to look intimidating i try to impress and sound correct and they always try to make me say something wrong english is not my first language i feel a lot of those recruiter are acting weird when i mispronounce something like today i had an interview and this lady who wa the recruiter wa acting like ohh how do you pronounce your middle name exactly is this letter in your language pronounced like that oh wowthen the way she came across wa kinda off but it seems it the same at almost every casual restaurant some young female who try to act smart and put you off i dont know how to handle that,anxiety4542,i recognize human are social creature but im too afraid to let another into my life intimately and consistently yet the hunger for such a thing is all too real and one of the most painful aspect of my life right nowi just feel like my i have this intricate glass castle a my ego that ive built to protect from abusive people oblivious people and angry ignorant people i have a comfortable mask i use in dealing with people but genuine relationship and building them i fall apart and crumble into some inhuman messtbh i dont believe in true compassion im always doing kind deed for the fuck of it but only to prove to myself that genuine compassion for others exists and isnt transactional,anxiety4543,when going to new place restaurant doctor office etc do you google information about it to prepare yourself like before i go to a new doctor i read review about the clinic look at picture to make sure i can find my way around and see when it busy so i can avoid those time can anyone relate,anxiety4544,i envy and hate everyone they just dont understand how hard it is for me to live and do every task they do with no effort it is very tough these day everyone say

group im generally shy and a bit anxious in traffic the exact opposite im often frustrated and criticizing other driversdoes anybody recognize this and maybe have a theory on why this happens,anxiety4546,this is my first time posting here so what usually happens is say for example i run into an old mate on the street or talk to a cute girl at college and they ask me for direction or something and i can easily give them direction or hold a very short conversation but then if i feel i want to talk to them more or ask them for a way to contact them i just cant do it and ill have to politely leave the conversation a soon a possible and avoid the person for the rest of the day what im trying to say is i can hold a basic conversation sliding polite not nervous but a soon a i want something from talking to them i enter flight mode,anxiety4547,asd and social anxiety overlap a lot especially in adult since it hard to differentiate nature and nurture however the fundamental difference between the two is that asd is the inability to read social cue and adjust your behavior accordingly whilst sa is more of a lack of practiceresult of past trauma or bad experience ofc inability to socialize properly can easily lead to bullying and exclusion which result in sa but if youre nt to begin with you can still learn social skill through a lot of practice till it becomes natural and you can enjoy social situation without burnouts theoreticallyim not officially diagnosed yet but do tick many box and wouldnt be surprised if im actually on the spectrum for those who are diagnosed how do you move on do you still try to learn social skill to blend in even if it immensely stressful or do you just give up on everything,anxiety4548,just a rant,anxiety4549,it hard to exactly say what caused my social anxiety because there many factor such a my manipulative best friend my alcoholic father growing up neglected etchowever there one moment which i often look back on and cant help but think of a the moment that truly made my sa unbearable and it is my year   day overnight school tripill try to keep it short but i ended up being betrayed by people who i thought were my friend we were all separated into group of about  so me and my  friend and  new girl all shared a hotel room for  nightsi wa basically outcasted by everyone i wa being ignored left and right and no one cared about what i had to say my friend bonded easily with the  new girl and stayed up all night with them having fun i dont really stay up late a i can get quite tired especially after a long day so i went to sleep in one of the room we decided i wa going to share with friend ai laid down to sleep but it didnt work people above u were partying and blasting music and my own friend were screaming lyric next door i ended up just laying there with my headphone in playing some music to hopefully knock out i heard the girl leave the hotel room probably to go to someone el some time pass and i hear them come back and open the door to my bedroom i hear laughter and friend a asking if i had fallen asleep to the other girl i froze the next few minute were probably the most heartbreaking moment of my life i overheard friend a joking about how ugly and annoying i wa and they all laughed she then got mad that i had fallen asleep in the double bed though we both agreed to share it she acted like i infected the whole room i dont remember everything that wa said but those minute were torture they finally closed the door and my friend didnt sleep with me for the whole trip i laid there silently cry my eye outthe next day i started cleaning up their trash and they laughed at me and called me a neat freak even though i just couldnt stand looking at the mess they made overnight i ended up going out with them the second night to drink and we then decided to go back to the hotel room i wa walking up front but after a while i turned back around because it wa oddly silent there wa no one there they ditched me i wa so panicked because friend a had the key to our room and i couldnt get in it without them i ended up asking one of the girl that wa staying with u and she said they were probably at the party held at x boy room who i wasnt exactly on good term with i knocked on the door only to have him slam it in my face i yelled at him to get me my key because my friend had them he opened the door threw them at me and slammed the door in my facei stopped talking to them after that trip and friend b who kept quiet throughout all of this messaged me that that loved me i ended up mending my friendship with them until the end of the year and cut tie with them after another incidentthat trip really scarred me i never felt more devalued and humiliated in my entire life i felt like everyone wa looking at me a if i were some cockroach i felt like a running joke which i wasnt in on i havent really shaken that feeling sinceim so sorry that this ended up being really long but it pretty much sum up my trauma looking back it no surprise that i have intense social anxiety and constantly feel judged by everyone,anxiety4550,my life ha been a complete failure so far because of this disorder i cant connect with anybody my age just wanna die frl,anxiety4551,to add some context im  year old and i wa always shy a a kid i wa shy in high school too but i felt like i wa able to talk to anyone and wouldnt necessarily say that i had sa at that time just slightly shy anyway i lost my  month old son when i wa  year old and only then did social anxiety truly start having a negative impact on my life in a major way dont get me wrong social anxiety ha never had a positive impact on my life but i would say that i wa able to at least function in a somewhat normal way up to this point but after i lost my son slowly but surely the anxiety got worse and worse with every passing year i also went through a terrible drug addiction for a couple year afterwards and i know that that can have an impact on mental health in general so thats also a factor it gotten to the point where i will not go anywhere where i will be around people period i just cant do it i literally cannot talk to people the only people in the entire world im comfortable with is my husband and my child  im even awkward around my family and close friend i do not hang out with friend anymore and hardly ever answer phone call it depressing and it lonely any close friend i do have cant really be considered close friend anymore a i avoid them all lol im sure that trauma definitely play a role and im going to look into it a little bit more but wa just wondering if anyone else wa somewhat normalish beforehand and then got crippling anxiety afterwards ive never truly dealt with my son loss and i feel like that could be a very good reason a to why it only gotten worse over the year and i always wonder if it ever would have gotten to this point with my sa had i dealt with it properly or simply just not lost him in the first place anyway if this is your experience tell me your story  even if you havent had something particularly traumatizing happen to you in your life id still love to hear your story i know it help me sometimes when im just able to talk about it with people who understand when did sa start for you how ha it impacted your life ha anyone found any good coping mechanism that help you at least somewhat function or something thats helped you get better in a real way instead of just coping im tired of coping it just not working for me i feel like nothing doe,anxiety4552,removed,anxiety4553,hello i am writing this because i have no clue what i have or even if i have anything i would like to know if i should be tested for social anxiety but

extremely talkative and charismatic person whenever we meet other friendsstart talking to anyone it always end up with mainly her talking to them and me awkwardly standing on the side because she is usually the main talker in the group conversation i usually end up getting blanked like whenever i say something before anyone ha time to respond shell ignore me jump in and loudly say something else and everyone will immediately latch onto that instead and whenever she talk it will be directly to the other person excluding me entirely it feel like she value the attention of random stranger over me which is really hurtful the thing is this ha happened to me a lot throughout my life so i know it my fault and not hers but i dont know what to do about it or how to change it honestly making me really start to resent her because after every time we go out i just end up feeling drained unwanted and stupid i just wish i wa a funnier and more interesting person to talk to then maybe this wouldnt be happening to methank you for reading this long rant,anxiety4556,i have social anxiety ive known it for a long time but ive always been able to cope or get by with it until now in school and college you make friend automatically or i would rather say they adopted me a their friend and my first job wa kind of the same situation i had some remarkable colleague who accepted me and always supported me where i am from something called mental health doe not exist there you are either crazy or well enough to function people always assumed i like to talk le which is true and most of them leave me alone and thats why i dont have many friendsnow my current situation i have moved to a different country and after a long struggle i finally managed to get a job im a hard worker at least i

closing shift anyways my coworker texted me and asked if i could cover his shift i said yes but ive never done that before and didnt realize that i also had to get someone to cover for me so i guess

dead im already so anxious,anxiety4558,i get nervous just talking to new people i cant even imagine initiating flirtingphysical touch with someone how do you even become comfortable around that person,anxiety4559,i get bad performanceanxiety in social setting and it put me off socialising especially when it just meet at a pub and chat but i also like other people company if i know them well enough so sometimes ill invite a friend to just sit at home or in a bar or caf with me and do a piece jigsaw puzzle without talkingthe chat is confined to the occasional edge piece here and this blue piece sea or skyobviously sometimes a we get more relaxed we might bring up other topic but generally the focus turn back to the puzzle in nearsilenceas somebody that is relatively extraverted but also very anxious and nervous this kind of activity really take away the performance aspect of socialising like having to be funny or interesting it mean i dont feel lonely but i dont feel anxious eitherdoes anybody else do thing similar to this,anxiety4560,anyone,anxiety4561,thats outright the most devastating side of social anxiety for me that relentless inner voice judging me and everything i doi am in my s still single still a loner started medication and cognitive therapy just a couple of year ago after a lifetime of hiding in my apartment feeling miserable knowing that something is wrong with me assuming that i wa simply doomed to live this waythe only reason im here sharing this is because my med started working just enough to give me confidence to do so i am now able to talk to people without worrying what theyll think of me when theyd finally ask if ive got child and ill have to say no im unmarried or what would happen if ill say something stupid or blush of embarrassmentto all people like me out there i just want to say you are okay there nothing wrong with you know those stupid voice are in your head and that medication can help fade them out if you still havent found the right treatment for you please keep on trying if youre too anxious to make the first move towards treating yourself  believe me i know exactly how you feel and how exceptionally hard it is to reach out for help all i can hope for is that my story will help ,anxiety4562,you know ive just come to term that i have social anxiety last night at work i literally had everyone

overthinking but yep so i dont want to make it seem forced any tip,anxiety4564,im having one of those night where im like why dont they ever invite me out i used to work at this place where i had an awful bos that said some really whack thing to me but to others he wa excessively nice and bubbly my other colleague were junior and i mentored them helped them through a lot at work and when i ended up leaving they gave me very kind heartfelt word they even came to a little gathering i invited everyone to they had also shared with me some whack instance with this person but seems i got more of the shit end of the sticksince leaving ive seen them go out for dinner and hang out on social medium and obviously they wouldnt invite me if he wa there he no longer work at the company but they do but theyve never asked me out that way i tend to hang out with nerdier people at job  become friend with and when i do ive had multiple instance where they say something like you always seem so busy or it always seems youre doing cool thing  rarely i do and when it rarely happens ill post non chalantly about it on social medium ive also heard some of my nerdier job friend say thing like youre my cool friend ive also had people tell me i seem intimidating because i appear well put together but really im just an introverted nerdy and quirky persondo you think im coming across off putting honestly in the grand scheme these people dont matter but i cant help but feel hurt is it me why le sigh so ,anxiety4565, you   probably already know in how many way social medium help u with   daytoday life we can keep in touch with our loved one we can inform   ourselves about the world around u we can also meet new people who  we  share the same interest withbut   the amount of time spend on social medium is unreal some people spend   more than  hour a day on their phone scrolling is more time  being  a waste instead on being productive social medium is full of fake  role  model it changing lot of people whether in look or  mindset it  putting this false image what being a talent mean most  of them be just  a copy from a preview guy and thats just the way the  algorithm work  a lot of youth take everything they see on a social  platform a the  truth and they wish to be this untalented as   but this young  people dont know how the life of the influencers look  like when the  camera is turned offtell me how you see it what is your opinion on this subject ,anxiety4566,obviously id need a diagnosis by a professional but i want to know if these scenario fall into social anxiety symptom i know that people who have social anxiety can get nervous fast heart racing etc but i dont really have most of those which is why im askingso usually im in a group and there are people talking i want to join the conversation i want to talk along with them but i just freeze up i cant come up with anything i see them laugh and mess around and i want to join them but my lack of socialization just make stay quiet i also get nervous what people think about what im doing even though i know they dont care i get a little sweaty when im not getting something right in public or whether im just at the gym overthinking that people are judging mei this me just sucking at socializing or doe it seem like something i should get a diagnosis for,anxiety4567,so i find myself in a very frustrating spot when it come to my anxiety conversation come pretty natural to me and once i have my rhythm going i feel i could talk to just about anyone my problem is i can never get there approaching people and starting conversation especially with woman a i try to date leaf me absolutely petrified and my failure to do so often leaf me miserable for the rest of the day if not into the next daya little rundown of myself im a  year old male id say im pretty average in attractiveness and ive been pretty shy my entire life but that shyness ha always gone away once the ice ha broken but a ive moved on to the adult world and the work force i have really began to notice how much i relied on an outside force bringing me in contact with others school mainly to break the ice and allow me to develop relationship this rant will mainly pertain to dating though these thing trouble me in other area to lesser degree i find that when im in a social setting the thought of actually approaching someone and attempting to talk to them is downright petrifying i can barely walk up to the bartender and order a drink the first time however i know that that all tends to go away once i break the ice i dont know if anyone else ha similar feeling to that id be happy to know if youre willing to sharethis is compounded when thinking about attempting to speak to woman a not only is my immediate panic a problem i also fear rejection am incredibly riskaverse and my mind automatically jump to worst conclusion i really worry that this is going to impact my life a i do want to settle down one day but i cant even start talking to a woman to get there and when i try to talk to others around me about it i tend to just get the same old responsesjust go talk to to her ask her out the worst she can say is noim sure many of you know the deali dont really know what to do about it if there anything to be done but if you read this far thanks for playing and if you didnt i dont blame you and you arent

afraid hell never respect me i wish i wasnt so cringe,anxiety4590,hi guy i wanted to post in this specific forum because i cant think of a better community that would understand i have been wanting to work for month now but am finding myself to be still healing from intense social anxiety that ha made nearly every job of mine distressing and miserable i am better than i have ever been but thats the crazy part  the idea of even getting a part time job in a coffee shop or something just stress me outim not going to give up and i do want a job real soon however i wa curious if yall canadian know about some government benefit provided in the event of mental health issue just to take the edge off for the rest of the season so i can focus on healing without too much financial stress thanks,anxiety4591,what is one crazy thing youve done or want to do that will get you out of your comfort zone,anxiety4592,i also struggle with depression agoraphobia gad and ocd biggest issue when come to dating is the meet up the very thought of it give me the worst anxiety especially if it with someone i have t quite been able to chat with for a good while before hand chatting longer before a potential meet up help ease my really bad social anxiety but most of the time guy want to meet that few day to that week i feel hopeless that ill never find love,anxiety4593,in addition to being anxious im also agoraphobic and germophobic af and get stressed just by sitting around talkative people in the office today the way they were loudly talking and joking around with each other while im the only one left out working in silence they know each other but i dont know them made me flashback to high school when i used to eat in the bathroom because the loud and crowded cafeteria made me stressed i thought i had completely recovered by now but being shut inside since  plus agoraphobiagermaphobia make me an even more nervous wreck felt like a loser loner again even though i had progressed to a normal state before the pandemic and it wa too much to handle wanted to go to the bathroom and cry in a ball but my eye would make it obvious i cried and i also didnt want to touch themfinally my meeting ended and i could leave the building i barely managed to not cry or have a panic attack thanks to the freedom of being outside i sat in a nearby park to calm down and stare at the view and there wa no one around it wa nice until i had to go backwhen i got back the bitchy obnoxious one wa whispering to someone else and from what i overhead im pretty sure she wa talking about how she saw me trying not to cry before and how weird that wa for her fuck them but the others seem nicenormal and it a shame that im too anxious to even look at them,anxiety4594,ok so i wa parked sitting in my car in a neighborhood for reference i wasnt blocking any mailbox or driveway there wa a guy kinda across mowing his yard after awhile he come over and asks suspiciously what i wa doing i felt uncomfortable but i said i wa just waiting and he told me i had to leave i got real nervous and i dont like confrontation so i decided to just get out of there if it wa the owner of the house on the same street i could understand but this guy lived across wtf doe he care i wish i wouldve stood my ground but i hate the idea of someone getting the cop involved i feel like a loser but at the same time i didnt wanna put myself in an uneasy situation,anxiety4595,im remembering some of the major life event ive missed while i wa a teen and im wondering why my parent never encouraged me they just accepted me not going i wa painfully shy struggled with friend and i confided in them about this however they were perfectly happy having a teen girl not interested in socialising dancing staying out late but it wasnt because i truly did not want to go it wa because i wa overly anxious and they knew that i cant blame my parent for everything but i wa the oldest child i didnt have any other role model around me and wa always eager to keep them happy it would have been amazing for my selfesteem my social skill my development if they just encouraged me to try it im  now doing a lot better but i so regret those moment i missed and it carried on to college too but i am happy where i am today and everything in the past ha led me to this point in my life so i cant regret too much anyone else feel like their parent could have encouraged them more thanks for listening ,anxiety4596,ruined my day,anxiety4597,this is my first post after reading a bunch of other post i think i am

family somehow although  i did overthink my word i wasnt panicking  maybe it the prozac maybe im changing my mindset because im taking a pill and it not actually i pill idk but i went to school today and wa still insanely nervous and threw upi think me being social anywhere with people will take quite a while but thats why im going to try to fix my brain,anxiety4602,i dont think i will high school wasnt so bad for me but why would i attend and see old friend i dont tlak to anymore,anxiety4603,i have to give a class presentation along w  teammate in front of all the student around  but im assuming  would attend  the faculty is going to question u and im not super well versed w the topicim freaking out  ive never done this before and i actually want to cry i could ask my teammate to do majority of it but i dont wanna come off a a freak or scapegoat for having anxiety issue advice please ,anxiety4604,this ha kind of been eating at me i had to give a presentation with a few others yesterday and i did so fucking bad i normally practice a lot before because ill get nervous and i know ill mess up otherwise i wa never good at doing thing impromptu but one of the group member wasnt there and i had to do a different slide than what i wa prepared to do so i try to prepare for that slide real quick but just before ppl are presenting one of the group member asks me to do this different slide instead and like the dumbass i am i say sure so while ppl are presenting i frantically try to read over that slide to prepare and once it our turn i completely bomb it i swear while my voice shake a bit i stumble through every fucking word and i had to repeat thing like  time because i couldnt get it righti shouldve said i couldnt do it or something but im a bit of a pushover an understatement i dont know how im going to face that class for the rest of the year and im just imagining the way people are laughing at me for how i messed up fuck at least there a three day weekend and i thought i wa acting relatively normal in the class until nowto be honest im just really frustrated at myself because if i had said something i wouldnt have to go through all that and i really dont get how people do it so well even without much preparation it make me feel so far behind everyoneanyway if any of you guy have read all that do you guy have any bad presentation story or something it would really make me feel better especially since im still so fucking embarrassed lol,anxiety4605,thats it,anxiety4606,thinking about going to karaoke tommorow the very least i will sit their with friend and enjoy others performing but i actually think i might perform a song wish me luck,anxiety4607,removed,anxiety4608,i have started my very first job in retail this week and it is absolute hell my heart is in my mouth for the whole shift and i constantly feel sick and stressed and like i want to cry i will stick with it for a bit but i dont want to be there for any longer than  month i also have no plan on going to uni but i am willing to do an apprenticeship if needed what are some low stress job for people with social anxiety i know talking with people will be inevitable but ideally i dont want to be working with the public or be a leader of any kind,anxiety4609, year old male i go on pretty well with guy but whenever i interact with girl i get nervous it doesnt matter wether im attracted or not when im attracted the social anxiety is sky high but i have learned to control myself a little bit when it one or two girl i am talking with my main issue is when i have to perform something like signing a song og doing a speech and there are girl then i simply flop every single time any tip to help with that,anxiety4610,not an exhaustive list i may come back and add moreampxb you have a ranking in your mind of the superiority and inferiority level of everyone you place yourself not at the top this is low selfworth because no one is inferior in worth to anyone everyone is equal so by thinking yourself not a superior a the most superior person you are indulging your low selfworth this is in fact not normal  non socially anxious people do not rank people and think everyone is equal you think asserting your need is aggressive and people will think you are asking too much this is low selfworth because you dont believe you are worthy of asserting your need ever want to speak up when you felt something wa unfair but couldnt you think some cooler thing like becoming an actor etc only more superior people are allowed to do this is low selfworth because a fully worthy human ha the right and worth a a human to do anything a a fully worthy human being be it asking out whomever you want dancing in public going against social norm etc now worth can be used in different context like someone might not be worth a huge salary but their worth a a human is unconditional you dont think you are the bestdeserve the best and you think thinking that is so egotistical this is low selfworth because subjectively everyone should view themselves a the best and raise themselves up rather than put themselves down it is in fact not egotistical to do so everyone deserves the best you often feel uncomfortable accepting compliment this is low selfworth because deep down you dont believe you are worthy enough of deserving them you often avoid serious apology this is low selfworth because you feel apologizing mean you are wrong and even le worthy and you try to avoid that you feel boosted when others give you approval and seek others approval this is low selfworth because at your core you dont feel sufficiently worthy from inside so you seek external source of selfworth and this is actually very unhealthy behaviour you think constantly criticizing yourself and others is just helping all of you becoming better version of yourself this is low selfworth because a person deserves praise just a much a constructive criticism and should be lifted up a much a possible rather than put down you think this a a defense mechanism to not feel so bad and feel the pain of not loving yourself enough you are often afraid of making mistake and always want to do well this is low selfworth because you feel like mistake can lower your worth your worth is contingent upon external thing when it should be innate and unconditionally full all the time you are judgmental of other people this is low selfworth because this is actually a way of putting others down so you dont feel so bad about your own low selfworth normal people dont do this and actually lift others upampxbso how do you counter low selfworth by developing full  selfworth realize that it is wrong and selfabusive to continue viewing yourself this way and anybody else who try to put down your worthjudge you are also abusive people who should be ignored,anxiety4611,it really wasnt a bad a my mind kept telling me now i think i have the confidence to go again for those curious im ,anxiety4612,rewind to le than  year ago im in cbt therapy for social anxiety among other condition and my homework is saying hello to coworkers instead of sneaking in and out the back door each day i keep a chart detailing my fear and experience it is scary afif you had told me then that today i would be running the same place of business and presenting professional development to the staff i would have never believed youthe hard work will pay off eventually i promise you,anxiety4613,im not sure but this may have something to do with my probablysocial anxiety so hopefully im not completely ot also this is going to sound really selfish it probably is so a few day ago i found out that a very close friend of mine ha neurological health issue which is really really scary it even scarier because a few week before that she told me that she often ha unusual headache and she halfjokingly told me that according to google she probably ha a brain tumor now i cant get that possibility out of my mind though it probably can be ton of other thing she wa supposed to have mr today so we know nothing yet anyway whatever this is i cant imagine it to be something notserious so im really scared and yes now it definitely not time to think about my issue i should be there for her  and be supportive except i realized i cant do it i remembered how i suck treating people with health issue i never know what to say to them if they need support i also never instinctively know what to do like should i ask them every day how they feel no it just going to annoy them but if im not going to ask they are going to think i dont care nothing feel right if i visit an injured or ill friend it always so awkward i should jump around and help with everything but i cant care for people im clumsy and never know what exactly i should do and then i suddenly realize that a friend who cant walk properly is bringing me a glass of water while im sitting at the spot instead of doing it myself and thinking how the heck that happened while feeling like the worst person so basically i know it selfish but now im doubleworried im worried about my friend wellbeing but also about my inability to handle the situation i feel like a huge friendship test is coming after decade of friendship and im going to fail,anxiety4614,along this journey of working on myself and overcoming social anxiety it ha always been this battle of trying to do everything perfect trying to say the right thing trying to walk in a way thats normal not showing any sign or trace to others that im feeling nervous or even slightly insecureive always had this idea in my head that i have to act and order my life from this very controlled place in my head so that nothing bad escape so that no unwanted behavior come out so that no one see me in the wrong wayand it imprisoning it confining because it like im living from other people head and trying to shape my life so that i am always appearing good and everything i do is pleasing in their eyesim living for them and not myselfthis ha been my problem for the longest time even after spending many year working on my social anxiety and seeing tangible improvement  this ha been the issue thats continually followed me along the wayand i want to share something that ha helped me to address itwith social anxiety we tend to live inside our head and shape our behavior to what we think society want u to be and this creates a war inside u because on one hand we have our head telling u all the thing we need to do in order to be validated and accepted and on the other we have our true feeling underneath of that which actually want to come out and be expressed most of the time we suppress this inner voice and completely disregard it because we are so concerned and caught up in how other people will see u we live inside our head and just mute out what were feeling because in our mind doing and acting from a place of what we feel would be too dangerous it might cause u to be judged most of all it would make u feel like we were losing controlits not easy learning to reconnect to this inner voice it feel vulnerable when you truly follow and act from a place of what you currently feel like doing in this moment it take courage and gut but a ive discovered for myself it the only true way out of this prison you have to rediscover and get back in touch with your own unique expression and what you feel like doing in this moment go into your body and look what is happening inside you right now how do you feel at this moment what do you actually want to say or dothe more you can act from this inner place where youre following your feeling and staying guided by what you authentically want to do in this moment the more i believe you will begin to return to a place of aliveness and vitality inside where you feel genuinely good inside yourself where you are no longer caught up in how other people see you this is my experienceso for one week i challenge you to listen to your feeling and what you actually feel like doing in this moment embrace the feeling of vulnerability that arises with it lean into it and you might just find the start to a new way of life,anxiety4615,   thinking about trying bumble bff and disclosing on my profile that i dont talk much and have social phobia is it a good idea or is it being too vulnerable    i really lack a social life and i wish i could connect with someone who know the struggle of being too quiet so we can accept eachother a we are and maybe have a blue brother kind of relationship if you know what i mean haha,anxiety4616,i love dampd but have so many fear around approaching a random group and asking to join their campaign i have no friend and ive heard a ton of tabletop horror story where thereve been incident of bullying targeted at one player or the dm is bad or one player is a cringey maniac i think being bullied by a whole group scare me the most out of the other potential issue that could arise i know there are ton of awesome people who play dampd and are welcoming and so supportive of each other and friendly but ive experienced so much bullying in my life i can hardly imagine having that kind of luck with a complete group of stranger i am a people pleaser and pretty soft so i worry my squishy personality would irritate some player i think i definitely lean more toward the soft cute kind of character type than the tough armor clad warrior i have a character named theo who is a faun and produce plant magic from an umbrella and a frog character who class and subclass are monk way of the ninja,anxiety4617,i feel like this realisation ha been a long time coming because ive always thought im the type of person to think about how to make other people more comfortable  even to my own detrimentbut let be real always being so insecure about what others think of you how you sounded in that conversation what others think about you it always me me me im so down because people arent my friend and i cant converse with them normally but thats because during the convo im thinking about myself  of the time even when were having a convo and i ask them a question im too anxious to listen to their answer who would want to be friend with someone like that tbh whenever i am really invested in a convo im le awkward i know anxiety is mostly out of my hand but i feel like im on the right track with realising this and trying to combat it,anxiety4618,watching old music video and i realized slash is sweaty and always ha his face and head hidden  axle rose with the wide bandanna and hat is he hiding hyper hydrosis  i dont know  just trying to feel more normal and not so different i guessknow of any famous people that have sa and still are a public persona or made something of their life  actor scientist anyone really  need some inspiration today,anxiety4619,because of my anxiety i struggle to get a job havent gotten one yet finally it to a point where it not optional i need it so i applied to a warehouse job last night and they called this morning and i missed it and sent an email to call back this is where i normally quit i dont do call but i sat there for  hour shaking holding the phone until i finally hit call i wrote an entire script for different possibility i wa ready they didnt answer not only did they not answer but it said something like cant come to the phone right now if youre returning a call leave your name and number and ill get back to you and if youre calling for a late package i wa so freaked out i couldnt breathe but i knew i wouldnt call back so i said hi im returning a call my name is  and my number is  thanks and hung up so fast it wa so insanely fast and i sounded like i wa laughing and idek if i heard it right did they mean phone number they just said number they didnt say what number i used my number to call how could it be my phone number i did it wrong wa i even responding to the right thing i want to turn my phone off and sob so badly but what if they call again i cant miss it or i wont call again im so scared thinking my phone can ring at any second and i just have to answer and have no idea what they even want to talk about i want to rip my skin off i cant keep going throughout life like this it hurt so bad and it physically and mentally damaging me i literally cant do anything until this call is over with now i feel like im dying,anxiety4620,are you hopeful that youll get out of this  are you hopeful that you will be happy and normal ,anxiety4621,i posted this in ranxiety first but i am not really sure what the overlap in community is like and id like to get a much advice a possiblei have dealt with anxiety and depression for the majority of my life throughout the year i have seen a number of counselor and been onandoff of medicine recently started back up againi am currently in a transitional period of my life where i have finished school and am entering the workforce i have been out of school for over  month now and over the last few month i have had a lot of familial pressure to find work i only sent out a few application because i feel like there are only a few job that i am adept forover a week ago i got a call on an application i sent out for a retail job and they wanted me to come in an interview the next day surprisingly i wa able to manage through the interview fairly well however after the interview i wa definitely left with le of a desire to work at this place i had a certain expectation of what the job would entail and after the interview i left feeling like there were certain duty i would struggle to handleabout an hour after the interview i got a job offer and i accepted it immediately after i wa filled with immense dread and i cried quite a bit that night i struggled to go to sleep that night a i couldnt stop thinking about the job and the dread i wa feeling over it i woke up at am and immediately my mind went straight to the job i wasnt able to go back to sleep until a few hour later thankfully i had some counseling that morning and i had a talk with my mother that made me feel better about the situation for a little whilefast forward to this monday i had my orientation it wa mostly watching video and signing document which i wa able to manage just fine however once we got into practicing some of the task my anxiety started to kick in it simultaneously feel like my mind is racing at mph and that my mind is going numb it is a struggle to process information especially in a scenario that requires attention and a decent reaction timewhere i really started to struggle wa when i wa told we were going to shadow a cashier walking to the area my leg started feeling like jelly i managed to breathe and calm down a little when i got to the counter and tried to process all the information i wa taking in i got an offer to try to do a little cashiering which i declined because i didnt feel ready yet but shortly after the cashier i wa shadowing told me to take this upcoming customer and the anxiety hit me like a truck i felt like i couldnt think and i felt like i needed to rush to get the job done i wa struggling to bag item and it seemed like i wa going too slow i felt the need to apologize to the customer telling them it wa my first day thankfully i only needed to check out one or two customer before it wa time for me to clock outafter this four hour orientation i wa drained emotionally and physically i went to bed around  which is pretty early for me ever since orientation i have really struggled to enjoy my free time a i am constantly thinking about this job and the enormous anxietydread it give me my first day is later today and i really dont think i can do this job especially because i know they are going to throw me straight into the fire today orientation did not provide enough trainingwhat really suck is that i dont feel like i have an out ive talked with my mom about some of my feeling and she talked about her feeling similar at various job she wa trying to relate but it sort of feel like she minimizes my feeling she tell me it will get better but i struggle to see how when the issue is not the job the issue is me i also feel like my mom ha been a little le caring about my feeling a of late and im not sure why perhaps she think im exaggerating or that my feeling are normal i feardread the disappointment that my family would feel if i backed out of the job because they have already expressed their pride and excitement to mei understand the importance of challenging myself and i do think challenge can lead to selfimprovement however i feel like this job is a further detriment to my anxietydepression i do not think this job is healthy for me in the past i have had thought about the desire to kill myself though i would never do it i dont think i have ever had more suicidal thought than i have this week i really want to work and have a deep desire to make my family happy but is that worth subjecting myself to these torturous feelingsi feel alone anxious depressed overwhelmed scared and hopeless i dont know what to dotldr i have a new job and it is giving me an unhealthy amount of depression and anxiety not sure what to do about it,anxiety4622,ok so i had a girl i liked

currently being teased with is young and outgoing very opposite of me my coworkers are saying shes also into me so i tried to talk to her but every time there is just an awkward silence i got her contact but i seldom messaged her i cannot even approach her which look like im not interested tonight we had a fun chat through text and said goodnight to each other i dont know if that came out normal or flirty and dont know how to proceed is the girl interested in me,anxiety4626,i just came back from an ielts exam i kept speaking so fast and not a single question i wa familiar  comfortable answering with  i still answered but i definitely deviated a bunch of time i literally hate myself i really want a good grade cause i dont want to repeat this again   i dont know how to like move past this  ugh im even more worried about getting a bad mark in general and my parent or friend being like  yknow awkward and like surprised,anxiety4627,i wa in a therapy session with my therapist we have done every session over the phone until the last one which we did over zoom to try to work towards in person session after  minute i could feel myself turning red because she started showing me something with her hand and i didnt know wether to look at her hand or her face and then i started panicking and not taking in what she wa saying and when i started cry i hung up and have ghosted her since im aware that it doesnt matter where to look but it how my head think and thats what it doe in the moment shes left some voicemail and had another lady leave me a voicemail theyve sent me an email and a letter in the mail it been almost  week and i dont want to call because i cant explain why i panicked and hung up without making it more awkward next session it feel hopeless like whats the point if therapy just make me anxious too  i dont know if i should admit myself to a hospital at this point or what i havent left the house in  month other than once to go to a different town where i know nobody and i still had bout of anxiety there i went through a drive thru once they couldnt hear me through the speaker and i turned bright red and panicked cried when i got home and i dont ever want to do it again my dad make me anxious for no reason and i dont leave my room if he here and awake i missed my friend engagement i wa supposed to be at and my grandmother funeral cant sleep or sleep all day lost ten pound in a couple month sometimes i have an appetite sometimes it extreme sometimes i just dont eat im miserable i cant go to the er here to ask about the hospital because i went to high school with the nurse cant work and have no income cant go to get government help with money because you have to apply in person cant face my friend because im ashamed of having a job and nothing to my name at  no energy to even shower more than once a week what do i do,anxiety4628,sorry if this come off a desperate or attentionseeking but i just had to get it off my chest ill preface this by saying that im a male student and ive always had social anxiety but all along i would like to think that i handle it fairly well im introverted and rarely initiate talk in public setting however maybe it because im pretty tame and quiet but always smile at others and joke around when spoken to that i made many many friend in high school from an outside perspective i did look like your typical school kid with a group of close friend that would hang out and whatnot because i wa so comfortable around my friend it might have contributed to me not really acknowledging my sa and just brushing it off a me being shy or whatever here where the problem startsi graduated from high school and got into a reputable college in my country into a course i hated didnt think i wouldve been accepted into this course so i just added it to fill in choice slot i wouldnt have had a problem with it except that my class wa all girl and this wouldnt have been a problem heck it might even be some men fantasy idk except that i had a toxic gf at the time no talking to other girl no girl friend only hang out with her type of toxic i being the little simp i wa agreed to her term and pushed away all of my classmate from day  this set me on the path of selfdestruction because what i had done wa basically threw away one of the few possible support system that would have helped lessen my social anxiety and isolated myself away from the people i wa to see for the next  year not long after i broke up with my gf on horrible term which i will not be sharing and that sent me down a depressive episode a you can imagine this wa detrimental to my mental health and only further worsened my social anxiety a my outlook on life became dim i started to think negatively about how others viewed me and how i viewed myselfthey probably dont even care about me anymore and have another group of friend  how i thought my high school friend would thinkwhy would i be friend with you when you pushed u away first  how i thought my classmate would thinki dont deserve to be in this school  what i thought about my position at the timebecause of all this selfloathe i decided to withdraw from the course and take a break this also wa a bad move a my mental wasnt in a good place this lead to my break being a combination of staying at home and isolating myself even further my sa which i have repressed and wrote it off a me being shy in nature came to bite me in the as this spiral of depression  anxiety only lead to more depression  anxiety talk to someone or a therapist sorry im deathly afraid of social interaction now how bout we fix that social anxiety by going outside or finding a job sorry i dont have any motivation to do anything now this went on for month until gradually i started to find a little motivation and went out for walk and talking to a therapist yay it gonna get better a happy ending im finally becoming a human being fit for societyand then i got invited to my h friend birthday party i couldnt be happier  i should probably tell you all that her birthday wa just one week before mine even though we drifted id say im still fairly comfortable with them so i decided to go obviously they were shocked and surprised i even showed up considering the fact i had been isolating myself from everyone i wont lie i felt overwhelmed with anxiety at first but also gratefulness that they still cared about me at all it gave me hope that maybe life wont be a bad a i had thought itd be for the past  month after leaving from her birthday party i went home with my  best friend in h a they lived fairly near me we talked about our new school about our old h memory and i shared about my struggle they empathized with me and i went back home happier than i had ever been for the past  month i started to pick myself back up and started cleaning my house taking daily walk and even talking to others albeit they were cashier and i sort of had to speak to them day of my birthday roll around i wasnt expecting many well wish considering i cut contact with many of my h friend after graduation i wa however expecting at least  people would wish me a happy birthday from my group of h close friend of  the girl who invited me to her birthday party of whom i had been childhood friend with since we were  and the two guy i walked back home with whom i considered my closest friend whom i shared about my situation to none of them ever did in fact only my parent wished me a happy birthday i love them to death and am forever grateful to them but i really wanted at least some attention from people i considered my closest friend on my special day even a halfassed happy bday would have been enough but none came the feeling i felt wa way worse than what i felt after my breakup at the start of the year i felt betrayed even though they did nothing wrong they just met me a week ago at a birthday party where they even talked about how birthday girl and i have such close birthday date i felt like a middleaged man working a  with no partner coming home to an empty house on my birthday it wa the breaking point for me and now i think im back to how i had been for the past  month i dont know what went wrong for my life to just turn to shit in the blink of a year i wa still surrounded by the same friend wishing me a happy birthday just one year prior to add insult to injury my sister didnt even come home to celebrate my birthday with me and my family she didnt even wish me a happy birthday a well so here we are in the present  day after my th birthday at this time when i couldnt keep this to myself anymore and just had to rant to someone even if it wa to complete stranger if youve actually read this far then truly thank you i know i sound entitled and privileged a fuck but i couldnt care le at this point i just wish thing would be better from here on out,anxiety4629,removed,anxiety4630,i said i wasnt going to do it again this year but today i gave in i skipped gym for three week straight last year and nobody noticed today i had gym went to the gymnasium a usual but got there late because it took me so long to walk there from the class i wa in before my class literally wa nowhere to be seen i feel horrible for going back to bad habit but now im sitting in the bathroom waiting for the class to be over i hate myself for being so weak i have no idea what to do im not planning on doing this again but i basically have no support at this school and no teacher care about me they even made me take a mental health test last year not out of concern it required and i read my report secretly that youre only supposed to give to your parent the report said i showed serious sign of depression stress and anxiety they never did anything or tried to help me at all and then one day a police came into the bathroom and made me come out that wa after week of me skipping the class when they finally noticed and it wa only because a student reported me that they found out they did what they were forced to which wa making me go to a counselor but the counselor wa terrible and didnt help at all by that point the school year wa about to end so it wa all for nothing im sure no one will notice i wasnt in gym today a usual im invisible at this school,anxiety4631,i went through a traumatic incident adverse reaction to a medical procedure early last year it disabled me physically which essentially disabled me mentally one day youre healthy and doing everything a  something year old doe and the next day youre losing your vision have stroke level high blood pressure fatigue rapid weight gain multiple neurological issue affecting balance and vision etc and develop ocd and dissociation because you just couldnt process what wa happening and feared what wa to come next it took me almost a year to get the blood pressure under control and for some of my lost vision to return i still live with everything else with no hope it sight i worked with a therapist to get a grip on my ocd and the worst of it went away within a year my ocd changed theme throughout last and early this year but fortunately a of late it been kept mostly under control the pandemic messed me up  i nearly had a parent die in early march  after a  month battle with covid then the divided state of the country left me feeling even more dystopian still i maintained contact with some friend went out to concert which is what i loved to do precovid etcthen this medical incident happened and not only could i not physically do the thing i loved but mentally looking at myself and my current condition and knowing i couldnt possibly ever go back to doing what i love because of my permanent disability wa mentally brutal i developed slight depression for a while a stage of grief i also wa quite angry for a while another stage of grief still the few time i wa able to go out socially everything wa fine i took a class at a different university last year after my blood pressure had gotten under control and made and maintained friend then throughout this year it set in that thing were back to normal from covid people had moved on and i felt left behind but because i had essentially isolated myself from  of people  i felt like i didnt know how to talk to anyone  stranger and even my best friend i chose to isolate ignoring the message of anyone who reached out to me the thought of communication is too stressful plus when i do talk to people it just feel like small talk and not like what normal friendship feel like i want nothing more than to be normal and live a life with friend to do thing with and talk toi know so far what ive said sound like social anxiety and i agree it is but what concern me is the other reason a to why i think this is happening my mind feel extremely slow word dont come to me a fast a they used to and not that i stutter but when i speak my sentence dont flow cohesively because my brain feel like it getting caught up on word twice when my blood pressure spiked i couldnt even speak from how high it wa i cant help but o wonder if that caused permanent damage even though i wa fine for a few month after my last major spike but maybe the accumulation of consistent high blood pressure wa enough to change something yes i know this sound like health anxiety but from my experience it not and the reason that it not is because every time something didnt feel right on a deep level like this i wa shoved off by people and the doctor yet it turned out to be something serious the  fever i had once a month that i wa told wa a viral infection each time turned out to be autoimmune and kidney disease the partial loss of vision in one eye that i wa told wa a floater try a swollen optic nerve this is arguably where we cue the medical trauma lol but genuinely i just cant imagine that something like anxiety would cause you to not be able to physically get word out cohesively without pausing speaking slowly etc if that last part is social anxiety that give me enough to get the right treatment and fix it but if it something that doesnt usually go along with social anxiety i need to look more into it thank you,anxiety4632,i have to go just to be nice because my best friend invited me i didnt want to turn down the offer and make her sad there will be  other people and i know them but i still get anxiety around them i just feel intimidated like theyre judging me or something i know they probably arent but it just been bothering me since yesterday i cant get rid of this anxious feeling so yeah nervous to go,anxiety4633,i have to keep repeating that to myself no one care that im alone no one care that i have no friend no one care and neither should i im trying not to,anxiety4634,i see a lot of people here wishing they were normal and want all of you guy who wish that to understand that being normal is overrated in fact there isnt even such a thing   in order for you to overcome your social anxiety you got to embrace who you are  so get to know yourself all of your little quirk your value your strenghts and weakness and get comfortable with them because it okay to be however you are right now  only after youve accepted yourself for who you are you can start to work on yourself and become the person you want to be which for sure isnt normal because normal is boring,anxiety4635,last night i wa shopping at hobby lobby for christmas decor im in my own world but im near a cute couple and their toddler all the sudden i hear the dad say something like you starting to decorate i wa completely thrown off by a stranger casually starting to talk to me and i felt my face go tomato red ive struggled with this for year i literally walked behind a tall shelf so they wouldnt see me after taking a second to calm down i went back near them and we talked a little more doe anyone else struggle with having a sudden attention on them it happens so often for me turning red literally prevents me from being a normal human anyone else struggle with blushingselfesteembeing the center of attention,anxiety4636,ive been living without light in my bathroom amp hallway for about  month now a they require contacting an electrician to fix beyond the obvious potential phone call i also just feel very uncomfortable having stranger in my home even if only for a couple of hour a this small job would likely takei use lighting from my living room across the hall from my bathroom or a torch if im taking a showertheres other thing id like to fix or change in my flat but anyone else just live with it like this for a stupidly long time to avoid having to call someone to come and fix them,anxiety4637,firstly the idea of being called on is terrifyingmy main rant is that the message is just be more confident and assertive sure ill get right on that why didnt i think of that,anxiety4638,i dont have the will to live right now my life so boring i think i am just a nobody friendless no social skill have social anxiety fear of judgement overthinks everytime living inside my head everytime i felt like i dont deserve to live this life i dont have the will to live right now my life so fuck up right now earlier in my school i feel so alone helpless feel different to everyone i dont have the confidence and courage to share my opinion idea feeling and emotion i feel like im only observing everyone else act a theirselves the whole time i am inside our room my mind is blank i dont have the will to move and act a myself act like my own self  i dont have any responsibility i just want to kill my self,anxiety4639,im taking a psychology class right now and it is talking a lot about mindfulness meditation and how it can reduce stressanxiety i think it would probably be a good idea to try it out since there are so many study backing it up i wa wondering if anyone with social anxiety in particular ha seen any improvement after meditating though,anxiety4640,i feel like i have thing to say but im scared itll be taken the wrong way also that nagging feeling of feeling so dumb what did i just post i cannot believe i

negatively delete delete delete,anxiety4641,beginning of this year  my mental state wa getting worse and it made me become more distant from my friend and i really wish i wa able to control it but obviously i couldnt so now i dont have any  nothing bad or dramatic happened it just that my relationship had died downlast night at am i wa just scrolling through old text message with my old friend envying that time period i had with them watching video of u together picture voice message etc it really hurt when you see the message like do you wanna hangout or wanna facetime and i remember being really excited when i get asked that i keep thinking im this independent person that doesnt need anyone and that i can do everything myself but it doesnt feel great sometimes i like to feel independent but not lonely yksorry if this sound more dramatic than it should be ,anxiety4642,i feel like to a certain extent this is true a no one can truly look inside of you and see what youre feeling but weve all been able to tell when someone wa incredibly nervous before so im just not getting itfor context i told them that one of my biggest trigger is other people being able to tell that im nervous some day i hide it very well and some day i dont ,anxiety4643,i am  and returning to school  i wa placed in a group and could not get anyone to talk to me  they excluded me  i wa nice i wa professional i wa respectful but whenever i spoke to anyone about the group project about how everything wa coming along i wa ignored  i asked if we were going to meet and they dismissed me or ignored me we had a group chat that wa ridiculous  whenever i asked a question via group chat  the leader asked me why i wa talking to her  because im in your groupbitch   it ended with me telling the leader to fuck off after she decided that we needed to redo everything two day before it wa due  my part wa already done   i feel like i wa severely discriminated against in this group  how do you deal with this level of ostracism  i went to my teacher he backed me up and i refused to work with them anymore  i called the leader a jewish princess which wa wrong but it got her attentionfinally   and i hope i hurt her feeling  if she doesnt want to be discriminated against she must learn not to discriminate against others   i got to sit in class while they did their presentation and it sucked  it showed they didnt work together their slide had no continuity and compared to the other group presentation it wa below par,anxiety4644,i want to share a tip with you guy and i hope it help

experience during class ive been practicing this a a getting out of my comfort zone type of thing it helped immensely with my university experience and my relationship with my professor so far but i noticed that every time i start to talk a little more than what im used to and realize that or im appreciated for my question and comment my face start to feel hot like im suddenly embarrassed for some reason even tho im starting to make this a a usual thing coming to class and asking complex questionsanswering with complex answer i still feel somewhat embarrassed doe anybody else get this way i dont know if it because im looking at my professor being interested in my answer or im sitting in a class where everybody is quiet to listen to what i have to say im also known for a pretty highpitched voice for a girl and this annoying girl in my class ha this thing of staring at me every time i raise my hand so i cant tell if this is just my overthinking and realization and it just me or if it normal for everyone i also sit in the front so it help that in my peripheral vision that i only see my prof a couple people to the right and left of me and my desk,anxiety4661,i just feel like nobody really like mean when im somewhere with someone else and they meet others that they know and talk to them all the time and it feel like they know everyone i get jealous af or when im somewhere and others that i know are having a conversation and im not part of it and other people are talking all the time and i say nothing or almost nothing and people dont seem interested in what i have to say i also get jealous af i just want to talk get to know people be liked be loved etc i want nothing more how come others seem to always have so many people that know them like them etc  and meanwhile it feel like almost nobody like me like it not like im an asshole at least not intentionally i try always being nice to others when they dont give me a reason not to i am genuinely interested in others and enjoy talking to them i might not always be confident enough to say a lot or reveal a lot but thats not because i dont want to it like others talk to people and then somehow become friend with those people i talk to people think i like them and in the end it never more than a distant acquaintance that wont even necessarily greet me a few month from now im so fucking lonely and the worst thing is nobody tell me what the problem about me is like i could work at it but i cant without knowing everyones just usually very polite with me but doesnt seem interested in connecting on a more personal level or at least hardly ever take the initiative to do so and the few time when i try to do it sometimes becomes kinda uncomfortable like people want to stay polite but dont associate with me i just cant take this loneliness anymore i want a few friendgroups that i like that i can hang out with sometimes and i want to date some girl and find love like normal people in university why doe it not seem to work for me what am i missing how do others see me cant somebody just fucking tell me im missing human warmth so much that just yesterday i thought  i fell in love two different time with one girl i had exchanged like two sentence in a group work and with the other one i didnt even talk in the first place but just saw her hold a presentation like it not like i still thought about them today but yesterday i really wa like holy shit she is so interesting sexy and beautiful i think im in love and two hour later this is the live of my life  im sure i never wanted to kiss and hold someone more in my entire life shes beautiful smart and likeable then in the evening i talked to another girl thats  neighbor of me in my dorm for half an hour and even tho i know shes way to young for me im  shes  and im not really physically attracted to her i still like talking to her a lot tho i fantasized about her knocking on my door and coming into my bed to cuddle and kiss when i wa going to sleep it just i need love more than anything else and for some reason i seem to be locked out of that part of life everyone else seems to find it and it not about look because there are  uglier guy le in shape guy le tall guy le stylish guy etc that still make it somehow meanwhile i currently go outside every day  thinking today something gonna happen and im gonna smash that barrier between me and other people really start to admire others be attracted to them even think im developing feeling and then just feel excluded everywhere go home alone feel lonely and am just desperate for connection with others im even at a point where while i wa  sure that im hetero just a few week ago i can now even imagine myself being physical with a beautiful feminine looking guy it like ive been away from other people for so long that i  could just see myself loving so many people it kinda is a progress for me that im even acknowledging that and being honest with myself here back a few year or even just month i would have never written something like this because i would have thought it pathetic and would have played the tough guy who just focused on himself but the truth is i always cared so much for the love of others i just always surpressed it now i at least try talking to people and am honest with myself but i still cant seem to go to the next level to actually get good  relationship and im using that term in the broader way so friendship and romantic relationship,anxiety4662,i always thought i had social anxiety disorder because i couldnt look

social interaction is pretty much need everywhere in this mordern day and age anyway so i read this today in an article about the new drug bcn social anxiety disorder is a serious anxiety disorder characterized by the persistent intense fear of social or performancerelated situation in which the person is exposed to unfamiliar people or to possible scrutiny by others

cause me to be tense in my body and not present in my mind for hour before the event and the whole evening sometimes i walk around and always feel i have to socially perform in one way or another a if someone would judge my way of acting talking walking etc further more i judge myself a lot i have a poor self image i dont like seeing myself on picture despite the fact i look very decent i also beat myself up for mistake dont feel good enough sometimes because of sad i have a hard setting  boundary etc  i hate the fact that my personality changed so much since age  i am  now i dont want to go into too much detail since it would be a even longer post but i really started having trouble around age  and then even worse the last  year since age  i had a bit of a life crisis from age  which ha affected my mood a lot i study to be a teacher and i do think it is a bit too much exposure  it is super uncomfortable for me luckily i can do a master degree and end in something le socially stressful i have been on the path of treating it for a long time trying exposure therapy talk therapy and even ssrisnris but the only thing that ever helped wa one snri which i stopped due to hair loss and low libido i even still suffer from low libido so i do fear some of the side effect could be permanent dont really know what treatment could help with all this said not socializing is also

are not dangerous you know then a bank robber succeed in many robbery he get comfortable and calmer each time why cant i improve to bare minimum,anxiety4729,fbackgroundin order to work on my social anxiety i got a job at customer service with walmart so far it ha been incredibly helpful my panic and anxiety about small talk and stranger ha definitely improved i have even able to converse with my coworkers and have casual conversation working here ha been a generally positive experience however with this new exposure to sooo many people i have received more general attention regarding my raceethnicity and romantic attention both of which have been an incredible new obstacle regarding my anxiety with the romantic attention i have just recently been able to simply say no when someone asks for my number or if i have a bf etc something that ha been incredibly hard to dohere is the situationone of my coworkers dave is in his s i have perceived him to be a grandfatherly figure of sort we have had casual conversation during work and have sometimes sat together in the break room with others discussing work and some light personal life thing i also would often help him figure out technology like his smart phone etc he doesnt really know personal space and give everyone pat on the back arm squeeze and lean in real close to talkone day he had asked if it would be alright if he called me sometime to chat a he get very lonely i moved from the west side of the country to the southeast people here are much more friendly and personable with each other this ha been good for me to face my anxiety however in trying to face my problem i find that i second guess myself more and dismiss gut feeling a paranoia out of desire to overcome my issuesin this situation i felt deeply uncomfortable and panicked i told myself that this is a  year old man and people are friendlier out here so i gave him my number he texted me that night asking to call but i said that i wa busy but we would talk soon i felt literally sick to my stomachfrom then on i completely avoided him at work outside of an occasional hello in passing i couldnt handle the possibility of what i thought he wa interested in me a few month later i passed by him while he wa working at the self check machine no one else wa around besides the two of u i said hello and began to walk when he said that we need to get together some time i said oh he then asked if i wa seeing someone i panickedlied and said that i wa hoping this conversation wa not going where i feared it wa he then said if it not too serious i would like to see you sometimei wa in disbelief shock fear and frozen that my paranoia wa correct my elderly coworker wa interested in me my brain registered that if he wanted to see me then he found me attractive and if he found me attractive then that meant he wanted to have sex with me and that meant that dave my elderly coworker thought i may want to have sex with him and so i said i had to go and began to cry and shake my sister work in the store a well i found her and told her what happened in between sob i told her i didnt know why i wa so upset a objectively he wa not a physical threat being elderly and all wasnt necessarily inappropriate offensive invasive etc if a younger man had done the same thing no one would think twice regarding the scenario but yet i wa profoundly upset after speaking with my sister i went to my immediate supervisor and told her wa happened i stated that i know he didnt necessarily do anything wrong and that i didnt not want to report anything but that i wa now uncomfortable around him and did not wish to be around him she wa shocked that this happened a he is in his s she wa very wonderful and told she would make sure i wasnt around him and that if i didnt want to report anything to document it in case he did go to far or continued she asked why i gave him my number which made me feel shame for doing it and asked if i would be willing to tell him im not interested in him the idea of doing that made me want to vomit i decided that since i told him i wasnt single i wouldnt deal with it but i also felt stupid for not just saying that but in the moment i didnt even want to acknowledge his interest in me i felt worthless and spineless spineless for giving him my number and spineless for not saying i wa not romantically interested in him later that week he sat with my sister at lunch while i wa not there and mentioned to her that because i wa seeing someone that he didnt want to get in the middle of it thus confirming without a doubt his romantic interest in me he ha since transferred to a different store on an unrelated note and much to my relief a i wa no longer eating lunch in the break room to avoid himhowever a new fear and anxiety ha emerged around elderly men unfortunately he is not the only one to show interest i have now be propositioned on multiple occasion by men this agecustomers this wa never something i thought would happen to me and so now i am afraid to speak with my other elderly coworkers out of fear they may be interested in me it made me not want to have small talk even more with customer i have never in my life received this kind of attention so it is very unusual and overwhelming i understand that due to the environment i am around a lot of people which increase the probability of these interaction which otherwise would be infrequent also when i speak to people about this they always ask why i didnt say this or that or why i didnt do this or that or saying that i just need to change my perspective making me internally ram my head against the wall for not having the ability to dosay what i should have for being frozen in the moment unable to speak another comment i will get is that it because im beautiful i know they mean it a a compliment to make me feel better but it make me want to cry and put a bag over my head i dont plan on working at walmart forever i have been waiting to receive benefit for insurance so that i can go to therapy and get some real help this wa mostly just a rant to express the totality of my emotion and frustration with my social anxiety in this situation a side note is that i do get flirtatious look and glance from men of various age but the only one that actually blunt regarding interest in me of  year old,anxiety4730,do you have

make sense,anxiety4754,sorry for being lengthy but i never really talked about this and i hope i end up posting this because it worry me so much and im only realizing that i might have social anxiety disorder now after friend off handedly mentioned it i thought im just that introverted and it my asthma acting up even though doctor said i dont need to use an inhaler anymore since a couple of year ago and that all is good ill talk about what got me to worry about this which is what happened this monday and i still cant calm down over then after ampampamp mark ill talk about some more general thing and feeling i have which you can skip my memory is fuzzy after panic attack but this is what i remember i had to present my university project and because i wa around dead last professor and her helper were tired and frustrated so they had a bit ruder tone and didnt let me speak about my idea at all i started shaking and my eye teared up so i stepped away but one of helper got up to probably ask me something but i just embarrassingly started cry and then hyperventilating thankfully person next to me had understanding and took me to the empty bathroom to calm down still even though she reacted in minute and it wa one of shortest min panic attack i had i kept on worrying and this very minute i still worry that everyone saw me think weirdly of me that the student doe too after all how could they not im only one who broke down because of this and it been a month since we started and it happened almost twice at uni and  time in bus i just couldnt calm down i couldnt breathe i wa worrying but also couldnt think my hand were numb and weak but still they were putting pressure around my own neck aiding in difficulty breathing i only later registered i kept on apologizing to the student who helped me despite being breathless and i feel like she must hate me now and how im making a scene like how professor and everyone think too this is like something that happens a lot to me during a year for like  year now but none really ever told me anything and today when i talked to parent about it i wa told im probably just spoiled and should talk more since i never did but im now reading stuff about social anxiety and everything is something i can absolutely relate to but this is making me think im just making a big deal out of it i should just get used to it and ignore it like i did till now which obviously isnt helpful any help or comment is welcome thanks is this social anxiety something else am i just paranoid should i push myself to seek a professional im very scared but if i feel like i cant overcome this alone dont even know how to do so honestly i cant even make a phone callampampampampampampampampampampampampnot the first time i started cry shaking hyperventilating feeling my hand tremble and go numb not even knowing how to stop myself and i can hear people telling me to stop apologizing and to calm down but now that im  and i have started university im worrying about it i do overthink a lot and everyone probably doe but i dont get panic attack this bad at home like almost never it only happens when i get a nosebleed and i cant ask teacher to step out because im too scared to talk and worry about them being mad for interrupting them when i miss my bus stop or get on wrong bus or when someone yell at me while i ride when im forcing myself to be social and active in class because it required for my grade and i just simply cant talk without my voice breaking my eye tearing up hand shaking heartbeat accelerating and feeling like something is around my neck keeping me from saying anything stupid happened a week ago too i endlessly worry every bus ride if im being weird i spend h on bus daily because my university is far away it always packed it hell if im even blinking correctly do i look weird a i breathe where do i even look when speaking with someone too it scary to look at them but people say it polite to do so so i end up switching between looking at their forehead and looking at the floor i cant even buy my lunch alone and starve till i get home because i dont want to worry about talking to cashier or if im lost i panic about being lost because it easier than ohgod talking to a stranger now i do have friend but it always  people so it u  sometimes th person come but it just too much for me and i know it probably rude but i usually dont talk to one last person at all and i never once initiated friendship or conversation and these people were always introvert and people i can feel at ease around i still always worry if friend hate me but just dont tell me or if im weird or if they compliment me im very scared to return the compliment because i dont wanna sound like a creep these new friend i made are nice but they are on extroverted side so im very anxious whenever they talk to someone else because dont want that person noticing me still i cant ditch them im  sure i wont be able to make new friend on my own especially at this point and i just want to try my best to change it just too hard for me and i keep on beating myself up over it overthinking everyday replaying situation that happened and thinking of different reply if i even said anything at all i could have made and i always feel like im doing something wrong and that even my loved one that i can speak to mostly actually hate meim really sorry for the ramble just having a moment of realization and confusion have a great daynight,anxiety4755,i stg the amount of post i see describing sensory overload or not

want to hear info that could make your social anxiety worse pls do not read but anyways ive really realized something you know when a therapist say no one is looking at you they have their own life people dont judge a much a you think it so not true people are always looking and judging and it just how people are ive legit had countless moment where i felt like no one wa looking or judging and a minute later someone say something or brings something up that show they were watching and judging the whole time it make you feel even shittier when you realize the therapist is just lying to make you feel better you really instead have to learn to just not care what others think ignoring the truth will make it worse it so fucked how thats how human are and not everyone is nice,anxiety4774,i booked an appointment with a psychiatric clinic i used to go to  i stopped making my appointment because they were online only  you would think having sad would make me want to video chat instead but

my first post herebefore i graduated school a year ago i wa doing a bit better with my sa i wa talking to people regularly i wa in club i wa staying in touch with my friend and despite feeling all the regular symptom i didnt feel a awkward a i usually do but in the last year ive fallen into a bit of a depression and i feel like ive reverted back on all the progress i made the biggest issue is that i have right now is that i keep overthinking every little action my friend are doing and thinking that they hate me find me annoying are only talking to me out of obligation etc i feel fomo and jealous when i see them hang out with other people regularly and i had a panic attack the one time i did hang out and i avoid their meme or message more frequently i feel embarrassed and uncomfortable when they ask me about my life and i avoid the question they are good people but i feel them drifting away i guess what im asking is ha anyone else gone through this any recommendation on what to do so that i dont end up losing my friend im in the process of looking for therapy but any other advice please and thank you,anxiety4777,i had to reach my s to realize that something is wrong with me i cant talk to people or have a normal conversation at all i only feel good when im alone i dont have any friend and i dont socialize with anyone not even my family i try to spend a much time a possible all by myself going to work and having to spend the entire day surrounded by people is torturing me every single day some worker there try to talk to me and i just listen i dont answer i get mocked a lot i also have an hard time focusing on what is said to me because i get nervous im like this since i wa a kid this is killing me ive been diagnosed with depression recently i tried going to multiple psychologistspsychiatrists but therapy just doesnt help i cant express myself through talking so i have nothing to say there it seems like they cant help if all i do is stay quiet the whole session they say i have social anxiety but cant it be some other heavy mental illness  the fact that im this weird type of person that cant fit in society is making me consider suicide how can i live a normal life like this  ill soon lose my job btw my motivation to do thing vanished year ago im not living just surviving,anxiety4778,first semester of college since the pandemic started first time living on campus the semester is  week away from ending and i have tried so hard to get on date and make friend and nothing ha worked i tried joining a frat but quit due to the cost and environment i tried making friend with my roommate only to find they all have gfs and i dont really like hanging out with them all the timei only have one in person class school fucked my schedule a week before class started and i cant bring myself to talk to people in class i joined so many club and their discord but most are completely inactive and the one that are already have their friend group and only talk to me on the rare club event im  so i tried going to the bar but again everyone ha their group and im always buttting in plus im poor and i need a ride there and back so i go rarelyi tried doing sport like basketball at the rec center and once again everyone ha their own group i try to make friend and they keep me at a distance a always plus theyre all so overly competitive it just a pickup game ive also went to school event game the library discord coffee shop and hike nothing at all the only friend ive made i caught feeling for she obviously didnt feel the same back and shes distancing herself because shes made new friendsive never even remotely put myself out there a much a this for some who is introverted autistic socially anxious and depressed it ha been a monumental effort and i have absolutely nothing to show for it i feel so alone the lack of positive social interaction is rotting my brain i feel crazy sometimes but i just dont care i give up im fundamentally broken and will always be a lonely outcast i hate that this is reality,anxiety4779,i have never had a serious confrontation with anyone in my whole life im  and it just too awkward for me i guess over the past few year my best friend and i have grown apart and he recently texted me wondering why our relationship ha been hard lately i fucking freaked out idk why because if anything it a good thing that were finally talking about it but we exchanged text and decided that there ha just been miscommunication between u and thats why we dont hang out anymore im absolutely fucking terrified out of my mind of hanging out with him again i dont think i am mentally capable of doing that because im so scared to be awkward with him we are basically sibling we once hung out every single day for a whole month he is one of the most important people in my life and having to have a serious conversation with someone where thing could go wrong is my biggest fear in the entire world i wish to god that we just didnt have to be friend anymore the only way i could see myself confronting him is if i wa extremely drunk or high honestly but even if we patch thing up it not going to just go back to normal right away it will be probably be awkward many time before it comfortable again this problem is making me very sucdal and whats scary is that there a bit of a time limit like sure i could go to therapy for year and work on my extremely severe confrontation and social issue but then it would have been so long since we last spoke i hate my life i despise my parent for creating me when all i know is suffering and i cant even leave without causing more suffering,anxiety4780,i think my life long social anxiety ha turned into agoraphobia the thought of walking two minute down the street to grab a coffee sound like a nightmare but then im always down to ride around and run errand with a family member or maybe someone im close with i cannot think of a time when ive ever done anything or left the house by myself i graduated high school a year and a half ago ive moved with my parent three time since then and i havent really met or talked to anyone my age since thenits weird because i really want to travel more and meet people and id like to imagine if i ever got that opportunity i would be okay i feel like ive never been able to act my age and i really feel like i should be doing way more at this stage in my life the inability to be independent is incredibly frustrating and i dont know how to fix it,anxiety4781,it been so long since ive just lived in the moment and really been genuine to myself and to othersi do remember some moment in my life back when i wa a kid when it just felt a lot more real like before i cared about impressing others impressing girl how i looked how cool i

my social anxiety manifest itself more now i care too much about others about how i look how cool i am whatever it a constant battle between my social anxious side that want to not talk to anyone and my genuine side thats more of who i really am and my egotistical side that want to be cool attractive better than others etcits weird because i look around a lot at people my age in college and i kinda see how stupid my thinking is i see a lot of people making genuine relationship friend having fun and it just feel like i have all these stupid thing im worried about that i would just be so better off without,anxiety4782,title idk how people just get a new look and just be,anxiety4783, hey everyone im a yearold teen girl from the midwesti feel that i havent really contributed to

especially to ask for help i wa at the self checkout and i wasnt sure if my gift card wa working so i asked for help,anxiety4785,sorry if this is no longer the place for this kind of question but i remember a while back that this sub sometimes had post where people just wanted to be walked through something beforehand to confirm what to expect or just so they could be told to relax lol and my anxiety is flaring about this for some reasonso im planning on moving into a new apartment soonish and so far ive been filtering out place based on grocery store proximity but i realized i wa being a dumbass because grocery delivery exists ive had grocery delivered to a house before which is great because they literally just drop it off and you never have to interact with somebody but ive never used a grocery delivery service while in an apartmentthe process itself isnt really whats bothering me i supposed it depends on the building policy to some extent but theyll probably just leave in the lobby or package room maybe ill have to go down and take delivery myself which is fine i guess the social anxiety come in because i dont know how normal or acceptable this is it not something ive ever witnessed which i think is why im so unsure about it i lived in an apartment for year and i never saw grocery delivered im lacking that firsthand experience and i guess thats why im making this post,anxiety4786,i had made a post yesterday asking how to vote because my social anxiety wa making me want to avoid it even though it wa something i wanted to do i just came back home after going out and im so proud i went to vote all alone  i wa really surprised that there werent many people my age but the people there were super nice so if any of you guy are in the u and felt the same way im hoping this post make u feel a little more reassured that it not scary,anxiety4787,im  and it been like this since mi adolescencei used to have a group of friend in middle school they were really nice a far a i remember but every time they wanted to hangout with me i refused mostly because my mom didnt allow me to go but just going out and socialize with them or anyone it drained me i rather be at home reading or playing video gameseventually they stopped inviting me to do anything of course why would they bother to ask someone who wa going to say no anyways at first i didnt mind that but everytime we meet at school they talked and joke about the good time they spend at those party i never could find something to say at those situation so i stay quiet everytime i tried to joke or talk to them they ignored me or look at me with a if i wa annoying them so eventually i just stopped trying when i asked my mom why my friend didnt like talking to me she would just told me because youre annoying and obnoxious your sarcasm drive people awaysince then i kept quiet everywhere i go not wanting to bother people or making them uncomfortable when i wanted to say something or wa spoken to it make me really nervous to te point of tear and hyperventilationcurrently i have a friend bless him really who tried to introduce me to his group of friend i felt uncomfortable and they were too i couldnt start or keep with conversation my mind went blank no topic no joke anything even tho we had similar taste in video game music book i felt sick of the situation so i told my friend that i wasnt feeling well and left i dread to think what they said about me laterhe tried to invite me to hang out with them again but the thought of that happening all over again is overwhelming i keep refusing and he stopped inviting me we still hang out but he keep talking about the good time he had with them and i feel jealous i wish i had his social skill to feel comfortable with anyone wish i had his social life gosh this make me feel like an awful friend he is a good person and deserves that and moreits my first post and i dont know if someone will be interested but i wanted to take that out of my chest,anxiety4788,this is bullshit ive been in therapy well over  year and every waking second im still tortured by memory of people treating me like shit the rage keep me up at night in school i never bothered anyone never spoke and people still wanted to start shit and i cant do anything to distract me from my mind replaying shit over and over again reminding me im stuck in a rotten planet full of a specie that i fucking despise fuck people,anxiety4789,it can be hard finding a balance im making choice i dont have much advice on that since it really depends on the person and situation just know that you dont have to be nice and humble all the time life includes moment where bad situation would be improved or something bad would be avoided by stopping somebody telling somebody no communicating your need some situation require kind of putting yourself first instead of worrying about what someone think or worrying about someone who doesnt care about you it perfectly okay to be choosy with who you help dont lose sleep over somebody who isnt going to take your help and do something with it dont turn your entire life around for someone who not on your side even if it mean losing your only friend or your only family member,anxiety4790,what is it i dont like benzos cause i binge them and they make me feel depressed plus dont fully solve the problem ive tried

ashamed of me she said that all her friend are braging about their older sister and how they take them out for shopping for trip but when it her turn to talk about me she felt ashamed she didnt want to tell them that my sister failed to find a job so instead she ended up lying and for my friend i know that theyre being nice and stuff but it hurt when they told me that theyve been talking behind my back about my situation and how i should change because like this ill never be good theyre right but i hate how now ive been behind i used to be the same level a all of them and i used to be a good student but i graduated college i failed to get into a master degree program and i also failed to get a job so now im sitting at home applying everyday without a response and for them some are

them my social anxiety get the best of me on the other hand it one of the reason im jobless idk what to do anymore i feel lost and stuck in a circle im almost  yo and i feel like im left behind and everybody is proceeding with their life and i feel bad for distancing muself from them but i hate the feeling of being the loser and the failure that everyone give advice to and everyone feel superior to i just needed to vent sorry for my bad english,anxiety4792,i went to vote today and apparently wa very anxious about it  any time im around a lot of people i feel the need to rush and be fast and quick with responsesfinding where i need to go  on my way in i basically walked in front of this poor older man with a cane who wa trying to leave because i wa tunnel visioned on the sign i needed to go to and he like excuse me and i honestly didnt even realize he wa talking to me initially   i kind of thought in the moment he wa waiting on people to pas by but i think he wa just moving very slow  but my husband wa behind me and wa still waiting for him a i wa getting to the table and i realized how i fucked up  if i had realized sooner i could have at least said sorry but my brain is basically dead   the entrance  exit situation wa a bit awkward which didnt help but not a good excusei am normally an extremely patient person and the last thing i want is to be rude    but once i am in that situation i am so nervous and my brain seems to completely turn off  doe anyone else experience anything similar   i am going to dwell on this for day and i just dont know how i can fix it,anxiety4793,i only have two good friend and one is always busy all the time with college i cant make any friend physically because my father and i cant get out much my mother is very nosy and paranoid id love to make friend online maybe over video game but when there arent many people in like a discord i get nervous because i feel too seen and when there are too many i feel unwanted or ignored is there any easy way to combat this or do i just have to power through it ,anxiety4794,so i had a phone interview yesterday that seemed to go okay and i got positive feedback but of course im still replaying all the dumb thing i said the way i slurred my word and the way i wa literally running out of breath while talking it honestly feel like i cant even process the word im saying while im saying them sometimes lol i practiced my interviewing skill with mock interview prepped answer for common interview question etc etc etc but of course the real interview never go exactly to plan im looking back at all the thing i shouldve said how i shouldve sounded more enthusiasticnice and le nervous something a simple a an interviewer asking about my weekend throw me so off guard all i can think to say in the moment is good how wa your weekend it make me sound boring and not enjoyable to work with i could think of a better response now but something about being in the interview make it hard to process my thought and think logically even an interviewer saying mhm multiple time while im answering a question make me lose my train of thought i guess because i feel pressure that they are trying to follow what im saying or are even getting impatientare bored i overthink a lot and i wish i could turn the logical part of my brain on during these interview my mind just kinda jumble all the thing that i want to sayconvey during the interview because the anxiety part of my brain take over very frustrating feeling like you cant confidently sell yourself anyone else feel this way,anxiety4795,ive noticed that if im in a social situation thats particularly stressful my mouth twitch at least it feel like it is im not sure how noticeable it is to an outside observer but it

wa just a tedious routine i had nobody to talk to i wa starved for some kind of social interaction but didnt have the skill to keep up a simple conversation instead i frequently listened in on other people conversation and imagined myself being part of it cracking some joke making people laugh and never took the mean to put myself out there because i knew id get rejectedin middle school i wa on an ssri i finally met a group of boy who i related to and eventually became part of their circle i grew more talkativei thought i wa cool and hilarious i would sit with them at lunch make joke and they would laugh i wa actually part of a group for once but i got too comfortablei started to say more selfdepricating comment and even resorted selfharm so that they would care about me moreat a point i still felt rejected by my supposed group of friend one of them straightup told me i wasnt funny apparently they were laughing at my joke out of pityi wa cutting myself in class next to my friend and i wa just mocked by him not the reaction i hoped fori wore men suit a a female to the school dance and one of my friend looked at my unwaxed leg in disgust and the thing is my friend were never real jerksi used a noose to emulate the act of killing myself in the school bathroom it wa not a real attempt at suicide i just felt like shiti had to move school after that this wa a some time ago and wa my last experience with having friend social anxiety still inhibits me from living im so fucking frustrated it unbearablesince then i have met with at least  therapist and have been on  other ssri none of them helped i am completely hopeless and there nothing i can do about iti cant drive ill never get a good job ill never be able to express myself ill never find anything that fulfills me im probably gonna die alone,anxiety4797,removed,anxiety4798,warning really long posti just dont know what to do so this thursday i am supposed to have  friend over to hang out and we havent seen each other in literal month this saturday  of them are also hosting their own thing and i wa invited to both and both are big gathering where i really only know the person hosting ive

cancel weve all been canceling on eachother a lot lately for legitimate reason and i do really want to see them however i absolutely hate going to large gathering where i dont know anybody and doing  back to back in one day sound like a pure anxiety nightmare after agonizing over it for a week ive decided im not going to go to either of the event on saturday but now i feel like if i ask them to come out to my house which is an hour away from them and then turn around and cancel on their stuff two day later theyre going to think im an assholeso im thinking it would be safer to say im feeling sick and cancel my thing on thursday so that it all fair and even when i dont go to theirs and normally i love having them over but i have been torturing myself over it all week  i dont have the usual energy and excitement to have them over cleaning the house coming up with snack and game and drink is taking all my energy and im really struggling to do it at alli feel like no matter what happens im going to feel guilty and sad and regretful because i literally cannot picture myself going on saturday anymore theyre going to be busy hosting and im going to be awkwardly standing in the corner with no one to talk to the whole time anywayi feel like everyone will respond with well just have them over thursday and be honest about saturday but i cant i dont know how to be honest and vulnerable with my friend they dont know about my depression and anxiety and ive always made shit up when i canceled and i really want to cancel thursday but i feel bad because it been so long and they seem excited but i just cant fathom getting the energy to host and then what if they bring up saturday  i can lie in a text but i cant lie to their face i havent been able to stop thinking about this weekend for day and it just keep putting me into flight or fight and panic mode and i just want to cancel it all so i can breathe but i dont want to be a bad friend and truth is i think i already am a bad friend because i often cancel going to their stuff because of my anxiety then i feel guilty when stuff at my house never get canceled my anxiety and borderline agoraphobia arent so bad in my own housei just feel like shit and i dont know what to do i really just want somebody to validate my feeling and tell me it ok to cancel everything and that my friend wont hate me for it and theyll be so busy with their own stuff on saturday they wont even miss me and maybe secretly theyll be relieved thursday get canceled anyway because i live so far away but my anxiety is telling me none of that is true and theyll hate me and everyone who responds to this post will be telling me im wrong and i need to suck it up and go and yes i am a bad friend sorry for the long post,anxiety4799,so im hunting for a

extremely bad even meanyesterday i managed to reply very well he asked me if i wa going to catch my ride a i wa putting on my jacket i then explained that no im going out to take image that wa my first full sentence i had ever said to him i even managed to say that id be taking them using my phone when he told me he had an extra camera to hand out to meonce i stepped out of the school building i wa so happy that i couldnt stop smiling who wa that back there what overcame meand now today we had a full conversation of course i wasnt the one to kickstart it though none of my classmate were in the classroom so i felt more comfortable talking we ended up talking about art and photography and i even managed to explain that drawing calm me down a lot i even encuraged him to test out drawing again when he said that he wish he wa good at art too i also explained it that take practice we talked about some other stuff tooi am very proud of myself to say the very least i can mention that ive had bad experience with male teacher before therefore ive been quite anxious being around  them but i can sense that this one is very kind and i felt like i wasnt being judged for oncei feel like i am slowly coming out of my shell and it a strange feeling i feel a if this is not a big deal  because my classmate do this with no issue every single day it natural to them but it isnt to me i havent been able to do this before at all the only thing i am extremely sad about is the fact that he isnt here permanently but i am still very happy with myself because  month ago i ran away from school and i ended up cry on a bench for  hour i wa so extremely overwhelmed and afraid that today today i managed,anxiety4811,anxiety over standing in line to votei am uncomfortable in crowd and line of people i dont know and the poling place is a place in my school so that make it even worse because i already dont go to this specific building bc of anxiety i really want to vote and i forgot that early voting wa an option but know i am terrified that i will have a panic attack or just be stuck and not be able to leave i dont even have friend on campus so there is no way for me to have moral support i am just really hoping i dont avoid it and not go bc this will be my first time voting and i really wanted to do it are the line typically shorter in the evening,anxiety4812,i get true enjoyment and motivation from doing stuff when nobody care about the thing or know what im doing when i tell to someone what im doing i instantly lose enjoyment and cant do it anymore even when the person also like the thing this happens most of the time but not always can anyone relate,anxiety4813,m sophomoreyes i am that stupid person who will probably fail my final because of my anxiety so there this engineering lab class that i am in the professor doesnt teach sht all he doe is read through his presentation and explain the theory he will never show exactly how to perform the experiment hand on unless asked otherwise he divided the student into group of  and i am part of one of those group all experiment conducted in the class are group experiment nothing is an individual task the rest of my teammate perform the experiment and i am not even involved and they do not even talk to me i tried interacting twice or thrice with them and all they gave me were plain one or two word answer with no eye contact and then i avoided talking to them completely after my anxiety crept in real badi feel like i am being treated this way because i am very quiet in this particular class dont get me wrong they arent rude to me it just that nobody talk to me and other people have too much to talk about and i am screwed because i have never worked with any of those lab equipment hand on or even seen a sample that the experiment had to be performed on i am literally clueless i had no interest seeing my teammate perform the experiment because i wouldnt understand anything and would look like a complete idiot amongst them my lab final are next week and i literally do not know anything about that subject i will probably fail i tried looking for online resource and asked people in my online class group but nothing seemed to help whenever i ask the professor to help me out with something hed be like ask your friend they should be able to help you out i dont have no fcking friend in that class thats all there is to share with you guy i feel better now all i ask you guy is to pray for me that i shall pas my exam thank you,anxiety4814,removed,anxiety4815,i need some inspiration

worse for the last  month my social anxiety is debilitating what do i do,anxiety4820,i have npc energy i only talk if you talk first and i desperately want to get rid of it because it the main cause of my social anxiety the only problem is that i am afraid of starting conversation with everyone not just with girl because i am afraid of being ignored,anxiety4821,i want to meet up with an internet friend but i cant go to bar or other crowded place the only idea i have is the park when it not crowded but it seems kind of boring because there nothing for  grown adult to do there,anxiety4822,removed,anxiety4823,i wa just waiting for my food at taco bell and decided to look over to the pick up area to see if my order wa ready then i catch this couple maybe in their twenty staring at me while smiling a if they were judging me and when i caught them in the act they immediately turned away this isnt one of those time where anxious people like u exaggerate situation they were very much judging me and i mean it once i grabbed my food they were still looking at me smilingthey were probably judging me since i wa wearing a mask and ugly home clothes screw these people finding entertainment in making fun of stranger it not funny at all it immature and disrespectful that experience ruined my day completely,anxiety4824,removed,anxiety4825,i have  friend in my class i wa talking to one of them in the break today and she told me about how one of the three friend doe not like me and feel uncomfortable around me i had clearly told them that i have social anxiety in the beginning of the semester and to find out that the person you trusted and shared your problem with doe not understand you and secretly depises you wa like a slap in the face i understand not all people can understand social anxiety  but she always talked about how she ha depression so i thought she would understand my mental issue a well but now i have to act like i dont know anything about this and talk to her normally my social anxiety ha gotten worse since joining university i cant even look at my own classmate and talk properly and now for this to affect the friendship that i thought i had is just unbearable,anxiety4826,i had social anxiety my whole life and even when i wa young i would be extremely scared of my uncle or male teacher i remember hiding from them or begging to stay home even in high school i would hide from the teacher to avoid them whenever i go to store and it a guy at the register i would just put my thing back and leave to avoid that interaction it usually guy with long hair im more scared of idk why maybe something happened to me,anxiety4827,accepting youre anxious and knowing that it okay it really doesnt bother people if people dont want to be your friend because youre anxiousshy then why should you want to be theirs cant go out thats fine just chill ive had great success just accepting myself and allowing myself to find true friend doing thing i enjoy im just not an extrovert and that is fine,anxiety4828,i have two friend i see separately every few month but we text everyday every time i hang out with them i feel so awkward or forced one of them ha been my best friend for  year and we would do everything together in  we stopped seeing each other every week because of covid and it went downhill from there we just hung out saturday for the first time since march but i didnt even know how to laugh or talk like we used to without feeling weird she also ha social anxiety so i guess that add to it right when i saw her she said i feel so anxious in a weird tone and it set me off the the whole day last time we hung out it wasnt really like this i just dont know if it our anxiety or maybe we just grew up both of u are going through a bad depression with family problem and lost our happiness i really hope to fix thing we cant even have serious talk or be affectionate cuz our anxiety i dont want to lose one of my only friend because of sa or depression,anxiety4829,my biggest issue is that i never have anything to talk about i never initiate conversation and pretty much only speak when spoken to ive read through thread of people with the same issue and the cookie cutter advice is always ask question or find some hobby neither of these point are particularly helpful for someone in my situation always asking question make the convo very onesided and feel more like an interview when normal people converse there is a give and take of personal anecdote joke random information and then questionsclarifications and im missing every other piece of the puzzle besides interrogating them the problem is that my mind is simply blank empty no deeper thought process if i read a book or watch a movie i have no thoughtsopinionsanalysis on the content just that what happened happened other people seemingly have a thousand thing to say and feel a need to express myself which is also why the advice to get a hobby is moot i do stuff but i cant talk about doing it for example i play guitar however i dont know or listen to many famous player know nothing about the different type or specific of guitar etc i just enjoy how the fretboard feel underneath my finger i too would like to express myself but my brain cannot conjure up anything internally or externally please dont come to the conclusion that i do have stuff to talk about based on the length of this post it is not at all representative of who i am irl some people are introverted but will share their thought joke opinion hope etc once they open up other people have idea and thought process but freeze up and go blank when the spotlight is on them neither of these are me yes im introverted but it because i lack a personality it a protective mechanism to keep people from knowing just how little i understand and experience there is no deeper me to open up to the world  worried that im just stupid or intellectually inferior because i have a hard time making simple connection grasping concept understanding joke in a timely manner part of what fuck me over is also auditory processing issue not diagnosed but ive noticed i often have to ask people to repeat what they,anxiety4830,my head hurt every single interaction i have with my friend who mean the most to me get spun negatively in my head afterward i will spend hour ruminating and it get worse every time i am always convinced that im a terrible person that i did something terrible or that everyone i love secretly hate me behind my back im worried that im annoying people i even found a way to spin my friend sharing one of my post on their social medium into a negative i cant even enjoy anything with my friend anymore because of this i feel like im drowning all i want to do is sleep because it the only time im not plagued by these thought this suck,anxiety4831,doe anyone else like to talk but struggle to talk about the thing they like because of extreme fear of being wrong about thing or just being judged for what you like i feel like i have to know every single detail about something in order to talk about it,anxiety4832,ive only been on  date at my age  girl actually initiated them none of these led to anything else in high school and college i wa very anxious and somewhat socially awkward with adhd

am i second choice here he never tried asking me out but he did flirt with me a fair amount i wa just too dense to see it also another factor is that we knew each other through our restaurant job were the same age and we started with the same position but he wa promoted to shift lead so he basically became my bos but neither of u work there anymore,anxiety4839,im about to go away for college and my parent are trying extremely hard to ask me to take all my class online so i can stay home i told them that most of my class only have class available on campus and now theyre considering we all

extremely skittish about having paw touched which is understandable a she wa still in a completely new place that combined with her persistent sneezing led to me booking her first annual wellness exam at a clinic where new client receive a complimentary nail trim  smoothing out with a dremelduring the exam i told the tech about me using feliway for my new cat i pronounce it feleeway and she looked at me like i had three head but eventually said oh you mean feeluhway it feeluhway not feleeway and i wa just like oh alrighty then sorry about the confusion well i looked it up after the fact and literally in the ad for feliway they pronounce it feeluhway but oh well it just something miniscule that doesnt affect my cat care i guess i do wish the tech wa a little le im right youre wrong about it though besides that she did a fantastic job with the pedicure l and the dremel made my cat nail so smooth that the pedicure lasted for a little over a montheventually my cat claw grew sharp again and i booked an appointment at this same clinic for just a pedicure a i wa impressed by the work they did last time this time it obviously wasnt complimentary and i wa paying for it they apparently had a very slow past few day so i had no problem getting it scheduled asap so i arrive at the clinic and check in  eventually a tech come out to take my cat back for the pedicure i muster up my courage and simply ask her will this include a dremel and she just kinda looked at me with a weird face and then awkwardly said no because shes a cat and my social anxiety just made me be like okie dokie then sorry about the trouble and then i slumped back into my waiting room chair and very stupidly paid the exact same price for a simple trim a i expected to pay for a pedicure with a dremel the service is literally listed on a sign at the front a pedicure with dremel   complimentary with first exami remember that beforehand i wa really nervous about asking them if it would include a dremel i think i wa worried about them thinking im stupid for asking if it would include a dremel because it listed in the name of the service well they still thought i wa stupid because i actually managed to ask the question i wa nervous about asking so thats greatanyways it been a little over  week and my cat claw are already sharp again should i grow a pair and tell the tech next time that ive literally had the dremel filing done on my cat and it wa just fine or would i be making an already stressed tech feel even worse i dont know if im being a karen and i know that with vet clinic it like one moment youre putting down an animal and the next moment you suddenly have to act all fluffy and happy over someone perfectly healthy pet i dont know if having a slow day at the clinic take away from the gravity of thatbut i just feel like every interaction ive had with a tech at that clinic ha resulted in some variant of them being condescending and it make me anxious to think that they think im stupid it also make me a little nervous that every interaction ive had with a tech there ha included them saying some minor but factually incorrect information while also making me feel like im an idiot i am more than aware my anxiety is probably inflating these feeling ive yet to even deal with major issue that require more complex care but im a bit scared to trust them with that if they dont even get simple stuff right ,anxiety4961,hey guy so ive been at this job for a couple week now and i wanted to say a few thing at first i wa miserable i wa grateful for the job itself but the

the phone call ill literally have to sit there and mentally preplan the sentence that im going to use almost like reading off a script i dont have any specific example of  in mind right now but a general example might be when someone say something in conversation and i dont respond with much but then  minute later realise that i could have said xyz connecting with people is almost impossible

and how you are perceived by othersim not a very confident or outgoing person and have struggled with social anxiety all my life yet i do have a very high sense of self worth that is grounded in what i know to be my true strength i might not be able to go out there and talk my head off in many social situation but why cant people look past thatfor instance i consider myself to be an extremely well spoken and articulate person when im comfortable and passionate about what im talking about despite my anxiety i have an uncanny ability to draw people in if there enough fire in my word but very few people want to hear about such topic and very few topic exist which would allow me to reach most peoplewhat i want is for woman and really anyone that i try to connect with socially or professionally to see my character before my charisma or lack there of im not here to impress anyone but the feeling of isolation that come with not playing the game is debilitatingi work in a traditionally outgoing field management consulting and it amazes me how easily i get written off because im a bit shy or how threatened and petty an insecure person who act behind their facade of a persona can get when i approach them authentically increasingly i believe my anxiety is more of a blessing than a curse a sort of warning system that tell me  of people i come into contact with are of a low vibration and thats why i feel so shaky around themwhy are we all ranked for how well we can sweep people off their foot why cant we all just be a little bit more intuitive about how we form social connection

forced presentation and stuff like that it also really bad at checkout and ordering food but i recently attended a concert and while my anxiety isnt so bad that i break out into panic attack i genuinely had a panic attack for what may be the first time ive gone to a concert before in high school a a part of my after school club but it wa a lame country concert small country school the pit wa just a bunch of high schoolers trying to touch the singer hand i followed my friend to the pit but it wa too hot and too many body so i decided to wander off on my own and sit in the further back seat the music wa pretty loud and overwhelming so i ended up exiting to talk to my teacher in the hallway outside of the singing auditorium  i couldnt hear anything because the music had been so loud and my ear were ringing it wa pretty tame but recently a friend had invited me and my sister to a rock concert since his other friend suddenly couldnt go i like poprock and wanted to keep my friend company so i decided to go im pretty young  but i have never drank or done drug or anything like that and this outside venue wa kind of intense everyone had such edgy look and the entire crowd wa wearing black i wore a white sailor moon tshirt because i thought it might be funny but i did feel a bit out of place haha we were actually late because we had gone to walmart to get ear plug for me so the music wa already playing it wa pretty quiet from where we were where all the merch food and drinking stand were set up my sister and her friend had a couple shot and then looked for someone where to stand they decided on the pit my phone wa on  so i decided to follow them because of course i didnt want to be all alone surrounded by a bunch of drunk people this pit wa extremely different to the country one full of teenager we had to squeeze our way in step on a couple of toe and almost spill our drink they didnt allow bottle cap because of pollution so i tried to cover my water in case someone tried to put something in it when i wasnt looking the music wa loud i wa pressed up against of people and it wa hot i wa sweating and freaking out and i suddenly realized just how tight packed it wa and thought about how i might get swept up into the pit and not able to get out i wa reminded of that concert of that big name rapper guy where people got crushed and died i started panicking i wa shaking and sweating and having a hard time breathing so i tapped on my sister multiple time and yelled in her ear so she could hear me thankfully she did and helped me get out of the pit by grabbing my arm and guiding me out the people in the pit were actually really nice and pressed back to make room for me i felt bad for stepping fully on some guy foot in my panic to leave the crowd i eventually got out and my sister led me to the back grass area where everyone else wa just sitting down and chilling she let me sit there and have her phone in case i needed to call them and sat with me awhile i think i started cry but didnt realize but i wasnt wearing any makeup or anything so it wasnt noticeable i hate cry in front of people and especially in public my sister wa already wasted so im sure she didnt notice and somehow she accidentally got cut on her back ankle she stayed with me for a few minute to make sure i wa okay and then i told her i would be fine alone she asked if i wa sure and i said yes and she soon went back looking for our friend sitting in the grass area wa a huge relief there were kid with their parent and other young adult and teenager it felt much more safefor the rest of the night i sat on a cement block in front of the grass area until the concert ended the music wa much too intense for me so i didnt really enjoy it but the light and confetti were pretty a lot of drunk people who couldnt stand were brought out and sat next to me but they were pretty friendly and didnt bother me while it wa a really bad moment and extremely stressful i wouldnt say it wa that bad of a day rock enjoyer are pretty nice and im glad i didnt ruin the concert for my sister and her friend,anxiety5006,im past breaking point im turning  soon and feel like

and what might actually help me break habit or come to more peace with myself im over dramatic but putting my shit in storage once my lease end to spend a year in a place where i feel more at peace and connected to the universe seems nice and a vow of silence wouldnt be hard either if i just limited myself to strictly necessary word only im really introverted do you think either of these might

never going to happen i finally got it in my head that i wa going to do something about it because it wa starting to get a little out of hand on my end obsessive thought distraction etc i had meant to approach him but i chickened out and ended up just leaving him my number right before the end of the shift and then practically bolting out the door i wasnt sure when or if i wa going to hear from him i had the day off today he had to work so i wa thinking maybe once he got done but he started texting me right in the middle of his work day which i find kind of funny but hey im glad he did but so far the texting seems kind of dry i realize it going to take a little time were both pretty shy and awkward neither of u are particularly social i dont think he ha much experience with woman and dating so im just kind of looking for some pointer to get our conversation off the ground and to find something to talk about besides work and generic current event and then it going to have to progress into actually taking face to face at work i mean we cant just go back to tactfully avoiding each other at work now can weim really bad at this part once i get to know someone and get comfortable with them then the conversation flow naturally,anxiety5024,generally i see people with social anxiety never wanting to leave their house and thats very understandable however im not one of those people i like going out i can do it i can go place by myself in fact i usually go place by myself my problem is i cant escape myself while im out while im driving or after im back home i miss

required to be able to establish a stable life get a job and what not but still is always been against my way of doing and ive come to doubt itll ever change im at a point where i dont even understand why i keep trying anymore some will still say experience will make it easier but the year keep flying by i cansee myself growing from teenage to young to not that young and nothing changed in my ability to function the one only reson i can think of is for me to be used a a bad example but even then people need to be aware that i exist for this to be useful oh well at least i have uh nevermind i have nothing this is a rent that wa not written in a sober state but it is one that keep creeping in my mind and if i cant get rid of it letting random stranger know is the most i know how to

happen with is when i wa picking out my crisp for a meal deal and just thought how i could use it for a snap to sent to a friend to make myself look cool id just think about which one to go for in order to make myself look more relatable i went for original hula hoop i think it just because i focus a lot on people pleasing but it so damaging ive lost myself to it and i dont even know what i like now i cant even chose a packet of crisp that i like because i dont know which one i do actually enjoy and if i do think of one i dont know whether or not it really because i like it or because im trying to make myself relatable ill have thought too about what id tell a doctor if i called to talk about my symptom or making playlist etc but anyway i wa wondering if other people on this subreddit struggle with the same thing and if they have have you found any way to cope and change it because nothing feel real now or spontaneous it hurt p im starting therapy soon dont know when because it arrange at college but hopefully ill find a solution,anxiety5028,im  and have never had friend ive tried going out to some bar but i just feel awkward it feel like anyone i meet think im weird or

how much i want people to remember and show me love while also wanting to avoid mentioning it to anyone or drawing attention to myself ive never been one who casually reminds friend and family day beforehand and i would worry that id come off a self indulgent or needy ive always felt undeserving of special attention yet simultaneously hope people in my life care about me to remember and say nice word to me on that daymy birthday wa yesterday and aside from my husband parent and motherinlaw not a single other person remembered or reached out to me via text my husband and i didnt go out or anything and i ended up working cleaning the house eating a bowl of cereal for dinner then going to bed early haha i realize how lame and depressing that sound and yet i feel dumb for caring at all it just a silly day i know and im an adult not  year old however i couldnt help but feel bummed and also guilty for feeling disappointed usually my  best friend remember but even they didnt reach out this year i dont have social medium so i know many people remember bdays that way however i also dont rely on it for my own memory of my friend and loved one birthday i have added them all to my calendar reminder i think part of what hurt is that this past year i have done very personal and special thing for my friend on their birthday depending on their individual personality took one out dancing because she love it even though it not my thing took several out for nice meal at their place of choosing and bought them food and cocktail some got sleepover movie night some got special gift made or purchased with them in mind each friend felt loved and showed me how happy it made them while i dont feel any resentment i cant help but feel down that it seems they are more important to me

medication one i tried have had too many side effect i have also been looking at my diet the situation is that i never drink coffee or smoke i only drink sodasugary drink alchohol and eat junk food like once a month or even le i exercise almost every day maybe a bit le some week i sleep usually  hour every night i have no trouble with sleeping the only one thing i found in my diet that might be different from other people is the fact that i have been drinking  liter of   fat dairy milk almost evey day for the past  year i do this because of issue with being under weight the extra  kg i have

shynessim not sure about the efficacy of the technique in this book but what i can say is that it is super quotable another favourite is discomfort is the price of admission to a meaningful lifethe overall message of these quotable phrase is essentially the only way out from social anxiety is to face it headon it going to be scary it going to be hard it going to take a lot of courage and determination it wont happen overnight but it can happen if you dedicate yourself to it life is all about finding new uncomfortable situation and overcoming themive said essentially the same in a previous post on this sub so many people on here are selfdefeating and have already given up because they havent found the magic button to solve their problem there is no magic button or secret trick find something that make you uncomfortable and face it headon whats the worst that could possibly happen you blush or break into a sweat maybe you freezeup or stutter or cant speak at all ok but you didnt die instead you faced a fear and youve taken a step to defeating itcourage isnt the absence of fear but acting in spite of it,anxiety5053,i applied a a receptionist in an embassy and im literally hoping they dont call me even though i really need to get my life together and have something that seems like a career i feel like my personality is not bubbly enough to be a receptionist i also have anxiety depression and ocd im barely social so anything that requires me to talk to people put in unease and i overthink about it beforehand i also put myself down having some thing like im not good enough and not smart enough to have any job when in fact i know that i have certain strength that i need to value like speaking  language being a hardworking detail oriented individual personality wise im introverted kind and considerate of people feeling and situation but my mind only through a negative image of myself when it come to feeling smartgood enoughi just feel like im below everyone else out here and no matter what success id go through i still have this lowworth image of myselfdo you relate to my situation did you overcome your negative thought,anxiety5054,how do you feel about being the quiet one in a group the observer and bring introspective the whole timei just attended an event and i talked briefly though my family wa the one who were chill and talked i just dont know what to say in some conversation that seem bigger than me like topic in economy politics or such i did make a goal to learn about such topic but when it come to reel life conversation i always lack the knowledge so i end up listening instead of talking what i am most disappointed in in myself is the fact i seem like i only have a pretty face but nothing more than that mentally i beat myself down seeing everyone else above me how doe an introvert become extroverted when necessary how do you talk to older people than you im  f and i find no topic to talk about with people who are older than me because again theyd talk about topic bigger than mehave you gone through a similar experience a me how did you changei also define myself a unsocial and though at the end i act that way someone might think that im extremely confident because i look like that but deep down my mind is only observing instead of talkingi also dont interact with people a much i dont have any social life yetps i also have anxiety depression and ocd,anxiety5055,boyfriend proposed this morning a for someone with severe social anxiety i thought it would be a long time before id reach this stage

simulate some form of social interaction if any i know this sound pathetic but i really dont give a shit at this point,anxiety5060,i have dinner reservation with a guy im into later today but i am the absolute furthest from excited im so terrified of it going poorly or being super awkward that instead of feeling excited i really do not want to go through with it like obviously id be disappointed if he cancelled but im also secretly hoping he doe not because i dont want to go to dinner with him but because im just that scared this is a really bad habit of mine and im gonna push through because the reservation is under my name but i hate that i do this to myself this is excitingtheres mutual interest and attraction and we have good chemistry so i should be excited i would think but im absolutely terrified hopefully i can just enjoy my time with this guy and forget about how nervous i am but leading up to dinner im gonna be a nervous wreck i wish going out wasnt so much

good time i got into a car accident this past week everyone wa ok and i had this moment when i hit the other car where i wa paralyzed by the realization that i would have to face this other person who is probably just a upset a me but obviously i had to do it so i did it and got through it and it made me realize how severe that feeling of anticipation is compared to actually just doing it ive been on a couple of date before but it been about a year and it something that still give me a ton of anxiety and dread because i get so overwhelmed by the big picture stuff  like if this date doesnt go well doe it mean im unlovable or incapable of love or i think about how many time ill have to put myself through this until i find someone if the date go well how long do i have to get emotionally invested in this person until they realize im kind of a mess and a loser i ended up just breaking it down so that my goal wa literally just open hinge for  minute then message this person back even leading up to the date i wa just thinking change out of work clothes and drive to the location instead of thinking about going on the date i felt like focusing on the literal incremental next step

had with therapist and psychiatrist i tell them about my life i go in detail about how badly social anxiety ha been affecting me and ruining my life for year i didnt finish school bc of it i have never gotten a job in my life i dont have any friend i am in my home every single day doing absolutely nothing but getting jumpscares from every tiny bit of noise i hear in my apartment building ive also been diagnosed with social phobia but yet whenever im in a situation where i could fight my social anxiety off for once like going to the grocery store for example and i tell my therapist about this she say oh so that you can do or one time when i wa able to push myself to go to the vet to have a checkup for my cat mind you i wa sweating and trembling like a nervous wreck in that veterinary office i told the therapist i did it and i again got the same type of reaction oh but i thought you couldnt do all of that yes i had one moment where i wa able to force myself out of my house for my cat that doesnt mean i did it without any problem that doesnt mean that from now on i can get out of my house everyday without any trouble that doesnt mean my social anxiety is cured now i just had one moment where i wa able to force myself sometimes i feel like i can never tell anyone about my good moment because then theyll think im cured and it all not a bad a i make it out to be my psychiatrist doesnt want to prescribe me any type of anxiety medication because she belief i just need some therapy to get over it she also comment the same way about my good moment that i get once every  year,anxiety5069,i just cant talk to people at all anymore i dont get invited out to stuff and when i do i get excluded from group photo and stuff i have barely any friend and no matter how hard i try in social event people just ignore or avoid me i havent been asked out in over a year and the last time i asked someone out they acted disgusted and now refuse to talk to me it just all taken a huge toll on my self esteem and i legit just feel horrible and revolting i hung out with a friend yesterday and even just listening to her talk about meeting new people and her dating life made me jealous and insecure like at this point i almost feel like itd be better to completely close myself off from society than try and talk to people especially if i cant even be happy for my friend when thing are going well for them,anxiety5070,the day before i felt so much anxiety ive been applying for scholarship and still trying to keep up with school when i went into work i could feel the anxiety coming i took my medication but it didnt work i wa sweating i felt like everyone wa judging me for sweating i kept dropping stuff i felt like people were laughing and staring at me i went to the back told my manager i couldnt handle it and quit i still feel too embarrassed to tell my friend i quit im sure they will understand but it just hard being a teenager and not being able to

strike or something along those line i just really really dont like the in my eye unnecessary attention i told her that in a gentle way over text tonight and she took it pretty hard and said thats her way of showing that she like me and she doesnt wanna change who she is but she did say that shell try to tone it downthis is my first relationship and weve only been dating for  month idk if this issue alone is enough to say were incompatible or if i can change my mindset to be more ok with the attention on me but lately it really getting to me more specifically when i feel like that level of attention is a bit unnecessaryhow do you all deal with attention on you in a relationship when you dont want iti bowl with one of my friend sometimes and hell say nice or just nod when i get a strike and vice versa and i fucking love it lol,anxiety5074,every now and then when i go for a walk in my city i will have to pas by some activist handing out pamphlet and trying to talk to people to make

with others and prefer to keep all my view private  although i see myself a an intelligent person i am extremely terrible at articulating complex topic that i am not an expert in however i always feel bad for ignoring them and feel like they would be judging me and if i did talk to them then i would be afraid of them judging me for not appeasing them enough and if i appeased them too much then i would feel embarrassed about the other side judging meone time i ignored an activist who i knew he commented on social medium about how people he knew ignored him it wa kinda awkward everytime we bumped into each other,anxiety5075,i just moved city and dont know anyone it already difficult making friend on account of ye old social anxiety and potential undiagnosed autism but it just made worse by the fact i dont actually like doing thing every potential way to make friend involves going out being part of a regular group club etc but those thing just bore me i know it a selffulfilling prophecy and i hate myself for it my hobby is my career essentially and i havent meshed well so far with my coworkers everything i enjoy doing outside of that basically involves stuff i do from home

joined late and missed the whole beginning ofyear introduction stuff  i kept telling myself that i didnt have any opportunity to talk to people for example sit next to someone in math how am i gonna talk to people in math that being said i wasnt the only person to join late a boy sitting behind me joined late a well ha a deskmate a well and i hear him chatting with him  saw him in the hallway chatting with people and that made me feel really shitty since i wonder why i cant interact with people at all for my science class someone else joined even later than me and on the second day i saw him joking around and chatting with other people also made me feel shittyworst of all i had an english group project and a new girl joined like a week ago so were over  month into the school year at

day of english had to have a classmate help me i didnt ask the teacher to make her help me and i couldnt ask anything throat wa unbelievably tense currently i can ask teacher for help without

anxiety ruining my social im  now in th grade and i dont know how im gonna spend the next  and half year of being alone  probably even longer if i dont manage to make a single friend probably gonna be even harder later in life out of school so i really wanna try it pretty upsetting to me how im fucking up my high school year like this considering despite being socially inept i really like my highschool everyones really nice  the teacher are really lovely my work not too bad either so i want to enjoy it so bad but it really hard for me being alone and not able to talk with

dealt a bad hand no other way of putting it i try and i try but i think everything ive been through affected my mind a lot more than i thought loneliness is hell sure but what do you do when you become so used to it you cant imagine anyone ever changing it because of how screwed up i feel i dont know if most people get their social anxiety from trauma but for everyone who ha im so sorry to survive horrible circumstance is one thing but having to deal with a screwed up mind year afterwards because of it nobody can imagine what we go through but u it such a pain having this illness,anxiety5102, i am really frustrated id consider myself rather intelligent and truly genuinely believe i am but this perception only applies when im alone and isolated from peoplei suffer from social anxiety and have for the majority of my life i could possibly be a little bit autistic and i wouldnt be surprised if i wa because i always struggled with social interaction and social activity mainly for the reason that i get too anxious the anxiety obscures my cognition or in other word my common sense this manifest itself in me missing social cue having awkward and silly body language having the inability to concentrate on the task at hand and making irrational decision resulting in people perceiving me a dumb and maybe even borderline retarded which isnt the case at all or at least i hope so i just get too overwhelmed from the anxiety to the extent where it compromise how mentally composed i am im focusing on other thing and not common sensei also have trouble with verbal communication i just cant form proper sentence because i cant think of the right word in the suitable time frame out of pressure i am better at conveying my thought via text or physically written because i am alone and not influenced nor disrupted by people presence so i have the capacity to think thoroughly and regulate my thought more efficiently which is why i say i feel the most intelligent whenever i am alone it the intervention of people that influence my competencei am sick of feeling like an idiot whenever im around people i want to be articulate i want to be perceived a smart i also forgot to mention i have adhd which just coincides with this whole mess,anxiety5103,so i have not been diagnosed with social anxiety but i know that ive had it since forever it ha gotten better a ive gotten older but some day ill still get the youre so quiet comment etc like at work whenever i get comment like this it almost take me back to the experience i had way back in school where i wa bullied or teased for being quiet for instance it make me think of the time when a kid at school wa about to ask me a question and then said  oh wait i forgot you dont talk  and then followed up with you never talk how do you even have friend there wa also a time when a kid said to a friend i had at the time wow youre friend with the girl that doesnt even talk during these instance back then id often get teary eyed or cry i still think back on these experience to this day when i get comment about my quietness and it make me emotional and sometimes i even cry im just wondering if this happens to anyone else,anxiety5104,can anyone else relate,anxiety5105,i think my social anxiety is affecting everyone at work and to my family everyone feel awkward around me now

friend doesnt come easy to me once i get to know someone it fine but it mainly the approaching people part i struggle with whenever i ask people how i can make new friend the immediate response is always join a club problem is ive already joined a few school club i think it would help to know what i could say and do to build connection through these club which is something that the people giving advice never actually reveal ive tried approaching people for conversation before and it never really lead to anything i make small talk ask them about themselves etc and they always just seem uninterested they always seem like theyre ready for me to stop talking i know this could just be me being my usual nervous self but there other sign like me always initiating conversation and never them in fact i dont think anyone ha ever approached me for conversation i know that i need to put in most of the effort but at the same time having no success ha been discouraging and another thing worth mentioning is i havent really felt like i truly connect to anyone i talk to it hard to explain doe anyone know what i can do ive been trying so much and nothing good ha come from it im starting to lose motivation again unfortunately there ha to be something im missing im hoping this subreddit can provide answer thank you if you can help,anxiety5110,male here lately struggling again with some social anxiety in my normal natural state i am an ambivert who enjoys my own company but also enjoys going out in smaller group and being social tldr dae have similar experience whats it like ha anything helped you i need to share mine because it been really bad and i could really use support from community too in my late teen amp s and in college i used to dress more adventurously mixed thrift store with new stuff dyed my hair different color etc and the attention i used to get wa often enough positive  getting flirted with having conversation and making new friend getting asked fun question by stranger etc it wa usually not always but usually positive and i miss that i miss the fun time and the friend and fun encounterswhile in long term relationship lot of my adult life so far i usually had no problem with people looking at me in any kind of bad way got approached by people often if we were out together and even alone  perhaps my body language still subtly communicated to others that i wa someone significant other by how i carried myself maybethen at some point in my s i noticed getting called sir whatever it meant to be polite in a service setting people would give me a wider berth of personal space also i wasnt getting a many random smile from people of course my clothing wa beginning to be more simple comfortable think nice pair of dark jean or jogger a tee shirt maybe a simple sweater it worked well in both the office and out and about today im a male in my s single divorced a few year ago with no kid and i cant help but notice the suspicion most people have it make me sad for the state of society in general unfortunately i know there a lot of scary stuff out there  violence human trafficking etc i like to do a lot of thing alone i learned to enjoy my own company  post divorce with some practice and therapy however  these past couple of year people have been downright hostile i get that a lot of u are struggling homelessness near u and encampment all over educated working people struggling to make rent every month inflation etc  and there major stuff going on threatening our democracy but maybe even especially now we should be kinder with people out there while exercising a healthy amount of caution   locking door not sharing sensitive info with stranger not letting kid wander outside of your field of vision or within reach for me i have to wonder if it anything specific about my appearance i am a single male  am mixed white mediterranean  southern euro and native american bornraised but often mistaken a foreign by ignorant people and i see people acting cautious around me these day wasnt an issue really when i wa in relationship or dressing more adventurously how so when i walk by someone car in a parking lot it never fails to hear that alarm or honk a though im about to rob them or something at a laundromat cautious mom and aunty eye me and i can feel it  with lot of suspicion a though im potentially one of those people you see about in the news and medium i get greeted with nothing but sir in a certain distant sometimes condescending toneim sick of this feeling it carry over and i feel like im being watched suspiciously everywhere i go now i went from being seen a arty sensitive potentially interesting guy to seen a potential criminal i am so sick of feeling watched and looked at with that kind of suspicion at best i feel like i must seem like just an npc but more often a potential bad guy and it doesnt help that im quiet and enjoy time alone american medium love to portray quiet loner a potential psychopath and so on what could i possibly do to get rid of this  someone once suggested go out walking with a dog and my goodness i absolutely love animal i love being around cat and dog so much but i am not currently in a position to adopt any and besides that i should be able to go out alone and enjoy my company without any of this anyway just because i choose to not be a parent or that i happen to be single right now doesnt mean i should have to limit what i get to do a a human being who enjoys going out,anxiety5111,i have barely texted any of my friend in a year it been going on way longer than
