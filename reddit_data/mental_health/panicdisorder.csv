0,i would like to assure many of you that panic can be treated  panic is not just our thought  it ha to do with our entire body  with our environment and our social life and our thought about these thing  but it not only thought  panic also ha to do with how our thought affect our nervous system  and how our nervous system affect our thought   and it is even more than this  it ha to do with how the food we eat affect the function of our brain and nervous system  a well a our digestive system    it ha to do with the overall homeostasis of the mind and body    tremendous literature ha been written on this topic and therapeutic approach have been innovated and are still being innovated  the starting point for fighting back against this vicious condition is to begin with education and then become disciplined about health  both diet and exercise  but these thing  above all else  require  motivation   the motivation of no longer wanting to suffer can become the beginning of overcoming this condition  using the fear caused by panic to begin to do thing that have been evidentially documented to reduce panic  above all a person tormented by panic ha need of  motivation  to get beyond this condition  to take the first step  it is necessary to take objective step  not impulsive or emotional step  toward eliminating it and reducing it affect on our life and this start with education ,anxiety

6,ive been combing through the post on this forum trying to support where i can  im not here to judge anyone  i know what it like to suffer from panic  it the worst experience ive ever had    that said  what can we do about it  some face it night after night  wave after wave  i dont have magic answer  im dealing with this just like you are  but i have learned a few thing    comprehensive counseling for panic is rare and usually not frequent enough  this leaf u in a condition of largely having to deal with it on our own  the most practical thing for this is to educate ourselves about this condition  it is a condition and need to be treated a such   for this workbook are really the most practical thing   i will reply to this post with a few i think are good     there are   thing      education     diet  specifically gut health   the crucialness of this cannot be emphasized enough       exercise     social support   if you take heed to these   thing honestly and diligently you should get some relief  if not  you can consider medication  i see it a a last resort  in no way illegitimate  for some it necessary but it doe tend to come with long term side effect and often doesnt treat the actual cause    most people would never think to look to their digestive tract a a cause of anxiety  but how do you think toxin get into your system  this should be the first thing we look at  is our diet healthy and are we getting toxin out of our system or are we being poisoned by them unaware    i had extreme panic to the point where it wa unlivable  i still struggle with the fear of it coming back but have been able to beat it back by taking heed to the   thing i mentioned above  look  i know these   thing are going to be harder for some than others  no judgment here   i speak from a place of empathy and compassion ,anxiety

10,i have suffered from anxiety and depression since i wa a child  i had an extremely traumatic childhood  i wa abused in every way imaginable since three year old  thats a far back a i can remember  the abuse continued until i wa    almost    and i wa placed into foster care  i wa in foster care until i wa    and then aged out  i had   different placement and   failed adoption    i graduated high school a year early and started college at     my first semester in college wa awful  it wa the first time in my entire life i had ever been suicidal  and i immediately asked for help  i began going to therapy and wa placed back on medication  a few month later i felt amazing so my doctor weaned me off of the medication and a few month after that i felt comfortable enough to decrease my therapy visit    i wa fine for several year  out of nowhere last year around february  i had just finished a tv series for the  rd or  th time and thought  yay  i get to be depressed for a few day now  that thought immediately sent me into a panic attack for some unknown reason  i began having multiple a day everyday for the following week      month later i just wanted to go to sleep and not have a panic attack   this happened at the end of march       i decided to take some of my previous medication  not realizing that it could seriously harm me  i took   pill and went to sleep  a few hour later i woke up to use the bathroom and about hit the floor when i stood up  i wa so dizzy and nauseous  once i got to the bathroom  i looked in the mirror and realized my pupil were dilated and i wa extremely pale  i then realized that i wa having all of the symptom of an overdose  my husband wa asleep and had to be at work in just a few hour  i also couldnt talk for some reason  so i text     and typed all of my symptom and what i had taken  i wa immediately rushed to the er and vomited on the way  thankfully i didnt overdose  i wa given told i wa in seratonin syndrome and given a shot of benadryl  for the next few day i wa in and out    i continued to have panic attack so i finally went to the doctor and asked for medication  the anxiety and panic wa affecting my quality of life at a level i had never experienced  i couldnt drive down the street without having a panic attack  i would have to have someone drive me everywhere  i developed s fear of elevator during this time  which im still terrified of  i would have panic attack in class and almost pas out  i would have them at home  there wa nothing triggering them  they just came in out of nowhere  i wa put on prozac and vistaril  after a month on prozac  i wa taken off of it because i began having uncontrollable nosebleed and ended up in the er again    i decide to go without medication again for a few month and thing began to calm down  i wa able to drive again and i had started my internship  it wa the last thing i needed to complete to receive my bachelor degree   internship started in may      and ended in july  during this time i began to have panic attack in the car with someone else   i majored in social work  and interned with child protection service  i wa in the car with someone a lot   although this wa happening it still wasnt a severe a it had been earlier in the year  i wa still able to function normally and it wa okay  at the end of my internship  i wa offered a job with the agency  and i accepted  i felt like it would be best if i started another anxiety medication just to be safe  i started taking buispar in august       i wa okay  but i wasnt really noticing a difference  at the end of september  the dosage wa doubled  after the dosage wa doubled  i started having what i thought were heart palpitation where my heart rate would spike to the        s and then drop to the   s  this happened one day and went on for   hour  i once again ended up in the er because i had no idea what wa happening with my body  i quit taking the buispar and wa okay for a couple of week  but then i began having panic attack daily again  they would happen out of no where and by triggered  in november i once again became suicidal because i felt like the only way i would stop feeling this way wa if i wa dead  when that thought popped into my head i broke down  i dont want to die and i know i wouldnt harm myself  but that thought wa playing in my head on repeat  i called the suicide prevention hotline and spoke to them  and then i called my mom  afterwards i spoke with my husband    it ha been assumed by several people that i have manic depressive disorder  due to the way i am and also family history  my current psychiatrist wont diagnose me with it or treat me for it due to me only being       i went to a new doctor at the beginning of december  we did a bunch of blood work and it turn out that i have a major vitamin d deficiency and vitamin b   deficiency  we decided to try to get those righted before i go back on medication    the very next day  i had another appointment with my gp and she noticed that my blood pressure had been high the last thre time i had came for an appointment  we had discussed putting me on blood pressure medicine but would wait until i got my blood work back    the very next night  i had another episode where my heart rate spiked  i couldnt breathe  and felt like i wa on fire  this time i thought i should check my blood pressure since the doctor had some concern and it wa          my husband immediately called      i wa taken to the er wa treated and out on bloop pressure medication  i am now on two but i am terrified of taking medication since what happened in march    i know that my job is a huge factor in all of this  and im transferring at the end of this month  my wedding is also in a week and a half  we are also selling our current home and purchasing a new one closer to my family  all of this is happening in the next   week and it is terrifying me  ive once again gotten to the point where i cant be in a car for more than    minute without panicking  we are moving an hour away from where we currently live and i dont know how im going g to be able to drive there or ride with someone there  im panicking about panicking and i know thats not healthy but i dont know how to fix it or stop it    i dont see thing ever getting better  my coping mechanism are no longer working  i can move the wrong way and have a panic attack  i guess with all of that  im looking for advice on how to help  reassurance that it will get better  etc  im at my wit end and dont know what else to do    just want to add i wa going to therapy during all of this  i am still continuing therapy every other week ,anxiety

30,tldr   son and husband have chronic health condition and i panic over it but don t want to so i can be a better caretaker and mom wife in the good time  tip or advice  please   i    f  have had panic disorder since childhood high school   it wa at it worst back then  but a i got older and i learned to lived with it  symptom generally lessened though never went away completely  getting older ha it advantage  i care le about what people may think of me and that allows me to escape or avoid situation which cause me extreme anxiety panic   a big component of what set off an attack ha always been a lack of  or perceived lack of  escape   control issue  basically   i have emetophobia  but it is more about the loss of control over my body and le about the actual process of getting physically ill  i don t drink or have ever used any recreational drug due to the fear of losing control   i ve always been hyper aware of my body and my first panic attack a a child wa over the noise my stomach wa making at night and how i couldn t make it stop   i give that background a context for the issue i m having now  my husband and  yo son both have a rare disease that affect their immune system function  basically they have an overactive innate immune system and various trigger    virus  bacterial infection  stress  allergy  who know what   will cause systemic inflammation in their body  for my husband  these flare can last month  for my son  the duration is shorter  but he get them much more frequently   every   week more or le   and he ha an added immune deficiency a well  fever  migraine  gi inflammation  mouth ulcer  chondritis  joint inflammation  and vasculitis are all symptom of these flare  so you can imagine it s a miserable experience for them   it ha also been very stressful for me  especially a i don t come from what you would call a  nurturing  family  not bad  just not warm   illness and caretaking stress me out  and those have become my life    there s also added pressure for me to stay well  a i have a healthy daughter i try to keep life normal for and my husband travel out of the country frequently  i m often alone to take care of both kid  one chronically ill  with no other family nearby to help out  though i have some amazing neighbor   i haven t been able to return to work because of this  but thankfully we are able to afford me staying home   i wa an elementary teacher before having kid   i did not have these extreme issue with germ back then  i didn t like them  but i accepted they were part of the job and i didn t ruminate like i do now   i honestly do pretty well when one  often both  of them are in a flare  it s here  i know what i m dealing with  and it s not contagious  unless it s caused by something infectious   it s the time in between and the sense of impending doom that i m struggling with  i should be enjoying the time they are feeling good  but instead  i am worrying myself into a panic all the time  doorknob are the devil   who know who ha touched them  public restroom  i want to do breathing exercise but can t because germ  germ equal flare at home  and if i get sick  who will take care of everyone   i feel so much pressure to keep myself and everyone else a healthy a possible    if i hear of an illness going around or my son or husband say he doesn t feel good  my heart race  i feel nauseous  and my night is ruined  i can usually handle it during the day   i hold it together in front of my kid of course  i only pace once he s in bed  i talk him through everything calmly and take care of his need even though i m dissociating  there have been time where i ve been super stressed out over germ and i ve been short with the kid though and i hate that    i had been seeing a therapist who specializes in chronic illness before the pandemic and she wa helpful  but once the pandemic hit  all my neurotic behavior became normalized so i wa probably one of those few people that rather enjoyed the pandemic isolation  mask   yay  staying home   yay  social distancing   love it  i already had plenty of medical grade cleaning supply and specialty hand sanitizer store due to middle of the night panic purchase so i wa all set when there wa a shortage  and it wa the healthiest my husband and son have ever been  so we stopped our session  but now everything is back to  normal  yet somehow even worse so i ve been thinking of starting them up again  i ve been volunteering at my kid  school to work on some exposure therapy   i file the sick note  hah  it ha also helped some  but i struggle some night still  i avoid traveling like the plague because i hate dealing with flare on trip  i am nowhere near ready to stop masking in public place  i feel like the panic is once again ruining the time i should be relaxing and making childhood a normal a i can for my kid   i know my situation is unique  i cannot escape my stressor  nor do i want to since they are part of people i love  i also feel the need to hide my panic from my husband because i would never want him to feel guilty like a burden or add to his stress  this doe not help the panic attack  haha   i stay strong for my son even when i m freaking out on the inside so that he feel safe  but we have had talk about what anxiety is and he know i struggle with it   i can see that he get anxious too unfortunately and i want him to know he can express it  it s a lot for a little kid to deal with  i may have some ptsd from when he wa a baby and so sick all the time  while also having a toddler and a chronically ill traveling husband on top of it   time were really rough  but we do have some treatment for my son so it is better now   but i m still trapped in that mindset   and like so many of you  my rational brain know i cannot control the thing i want to control so i should just let it go  but man  that irrational brain is persistent and noisy  is anyone in a similar situation  is anyone else a fixer or with control issue in a situation that cannot be controlled or fixed  i can t seem to wrap my mind around just going with the flow here  even though i m pretty easy going in other aspect of my life

59,hello friend  i hope youre in a place you feel safe and are doing well  a few month ago i took a probiotic and ended up in the er with intense anxiety  which a week or so later turned into the worst experience of my life  a horrific panic attack  alone at about   or   am  i wa totally traumatized from it  this anxiety state lasted about   month  im only now starting to get better  i have never gone through anything worse  but here the important thing  my panic wa caused by dysbiosis  which is an imbalance of bacteria in the gut  most people that stuffer from anxiety or panic would never think that it could be caused from their digestive tract  but this  in my opinion  is the first place we should look    here some important question if you suffer from panic attack or depersonalization or derealization  what do you eat and how often do you go to the bathroom    if your small intestine move too slowly toxin can leech into your bloodstream and cause all kind of problem  including anxiety and panic  this can mess with your nervous system    look  this wont explain every person panic  but it a good place to start because some people might not realize that their panic is actually coming from their gut  food ha to travel    foot through the small intestine before it get to the large intestine  thats a long way and if it move too slow it can mess with our health   if this is the case the solution is a healthy diet and exercise  coupled with social interaction  merely restoring movement should bring some relief  and on top of this we have to eat to consciously cultivate healthy bacteria in our digestive tract  that is  eating to support our gut health  the gut brain connection is very real and very powerful and still incredibly new  dont underestimate it   one more thing  if you have a silent acid reflux this can also manifest a anxiety  even raising blood pressure  i had this and didnt know it because i didnt have any heartburn  but after i drank some baking soda the acid  and then anxiety  went away  it hard to interpret the feeling we have in our body  be well and get support wherever you can ,anxiety

84,i struggle with a lot of mental health issue that cause a lot of challenge in my day to day life  i look around on the internet and there are a lot of people sharing their story and i want to share mine a well  so  i thought the best place to start would be my first panic attack   my first panic attack happened when i wa    year old  about   year ago  in my grade    physic class   we had a reading period for the first    minute of our second class everyday when everyone wa silent  sat at their desk  and got to read whatever book they had at the time  i personally loved reading period but something wa different that day and it wasn t something i could really predict  i didn t feel any different going into the class but a soon a i sat down it started   i sat at my desk in the front row and the classroom wa completely silent  i started to feel this sensation in my chest and in my leg quickly buildinga numb tingly feeling in my leg and a tightness in my chest  my heart started to beat fast and my breathing started getting short  if you ve ever experienced a panic attack you know that these are the telltale sign but i had no idea what wa happening  i wa very uncomfortable so i immediately ran out of the room in front of the whole class which wa not not the best feeling in the world    a i wa feeling all these sensation it became very uncomfortable and i wasn t sure what i needed but i wa positive about what i did  not  need and that wa to be in the classroom any longer  i bolted for the door and ran out of the classroom down the hall to the bathroom and just needed a private place to figure out what wa going on    at the time i had no clue what i wa experiencing and thought i might have been having a heart attack  i had no idea that it wa mental whatsoever  obviously  it had physical symptom but i didn t know that it wa a panic attack  in fact  i hadn t even heard of a panic attack at that time in my life    i remember being in that bathroom terrified and not even knowing what i wa terrified of  like most panic attack it peaked after about    minute and then slowly died away but i wa definitely prepared to go into the hall and get someone to call       or get me to the school nurse to be looked at because i genuinely thought i wa going through a physical attack of some sort  at the time it wa very traumatizing   the way the class were set up  i had that physic class in the same period for the entire week so i had reading period for the first    minute again the following day  i walked into the same class  sat down to do my reading  and again the same sensation hit me  i ran out of the class and i hid away in the washroom waiting for it to go away   it wa around that time that i suspected it wa not physical and wa more mental but i had no idea what wa happening before this point in my life  i wa definitely an anxious kid growing up  i had struggle with mental health before that point in my life but it wa the first time i had experienced something that severe and gripping   essentially  every reading period after that i had to sit in the hallway and read because i didn t know what the cause wa but i wa severely uncomfortable being in the classroom in any of my class when reading period occurred  a time went on i learned about myself  my anxiety  my thought process  and i learned that reading period wa a trigger for my anxiety   it wa one of the thing that would cause panic attack for me because it wa a situation that i felt i couldn t escape from  but at the time i had absolutely no idea what wa going on  i didn t know what a panic attack wa  i didn t know what wa happening to me or why  and i didn t know what wa causing it    all i knew wa that this thing wa having a large impact on my day so i started taking my book and reading outside in the hall for those    minute for all my class  of course  there are a lot worse situation i could have been inat least i wa comfortable in the hallway and didn t have panic attack anymore  but the point i want to hit on is how uneducated i wa and and just how naive i wa about what i wa going through   if i had known what i know now it definitely would have helped me in the long run a lot sooner to identify panic attack and that reading period wa one of the trigger of a panic attack  i dont know why they started but the great thing about anxiety  panic attack  and a lot of mental health issue is that you don t need to know what caused them or why they started  all you have to know is your present situation and learn the skill and solution to your current situation   so  if you re going through any of these thing a well or something even slightly similar then we re in the same boat and i think that hearing other people s story and learning about their experience can really help u with understanding our own circumstance   if i had other people story to read about when i wa in grade    i would have been able to identify the panic attack  i would have started looking up resource for panic attack  why they were happening to me  and coping mechanism for them  i would have discovered meditation and learned breathing exercise   i went through a long period of stumbling through the dark so i think that the major benefit of u sharing story with each other is that those of u who are stumbling through the dark can learn different resource  i think it can shine the light onto the dark corner of mental health that we otherwise wouldn t receive so that s all i really want to do by sharing my story with you   if there s anything that i want to leave you with it that you are  so  much stronger than you know and you need to remember that you are capable of so much more than you believe  it is so important to have faith in yourself even when you feel weak because it help u get through those really tough time like panic attack   i also made a video about this on my youtube channel which you can watch  here

113,i m a female  living in europe  for many year i ve been in chronic pain without explanation  sciatica  buttock and backpain  nothing wa found  turned out my doctor wa looking at the wrong place  yes i have sciatica  but it come from the piriformis muscle instead of my back  i knew something wasn t right cause i couldn t walk on some day  yet i wa told it s prob stress  when i figured it out myself along with my pt  i wa able to get a corticosterod shot and life improved somewhat  the specialst said   ha ha you re one of the unlucky few with this condition  it s very hard to diagnose for u  i told them many time i have buttock pain a well  a key symptom for piriformis syndrome  for   year nothing wa found  xrays  scan   the moment i decided to take matter in my own hand and pay for an mri myself at this private center i found out what wa wrong   large cyst were seen in my ovary when i had the spinal mri  something a doctor should ve seen  they were prob there for a long time  but this center rang my gp right away  thinking it wa cancer or something   then my gp failed me  she told me load of woman get cyst  and they ll prob go away on their own  but i wa told they were around   and    cm  and thanks to google i found out thats not normal and demanded to see a gyno  i wa diagnosed with severe endometriosis and adenomyosis and my organ are adhered  and i m infertile  so once again   it wa me who pushed for a diagnosis  my gyno told me that the sciatica and buttock pain is a result of the endometriosis  so   not stress   not in my head    it real   been getting panic attack  painful chest costochondritis and slipping rib symptom  neckpain  shoulderpain for the last   year  also stomach pain  once again wa told it d in my head and it prob stress because i been trough a lot  personally a well  i live in chronic pain  with daily headache and neckpain  so i saw a rheumatologist and neurologist  and orthopedic specialst  fybromyalgia wa their answer  cause nothing wa found  i have severe insomnia  again   it prob stress  doctor say    i wake up with headache every day and still they tell me this  so a friend said my symptom sound like it come from sleeping disorder  i pushed so hard to get a sleep study done  cause they thought i wa a hypochondriac  turn out i have very severe sleep apnea and stop breathing many time  and that s prob the reason of my painful muscle  i don t get a lot of deep sleep  i needed to start cpap right away  yet i m young  not overweight and i don t snore  that s prob why i wa told it s all in my head  it is life threatening if i don t tackle it    same thing is happening again   cpap therapy is giving me problem of vertigo  i can t hear properly anymore  nose is painful  sinus are painful  yet nothing wa seen on the ct scan  saw   ents cause i kept pushing  one told me i have perforated eardrum  the other said nothing is wrong with my ear and the  rd one said i have a very large perforation and deviated septum   so the air and pressure from cpap is triggering my nose since it a nasal mask   once again   not in my head  but first thing i hear is  stress   and there s many more example of my chronic illness having actual cause  no one ha offered a mri of my neck and shoulder  but i m in daily pain  i asked many time  i m pretty sure my vertigo i currently have is not anxiety  but coming from my neck   my rib are very tight and my sternum is a well  it make it very hard to breathe at time for me  i start hyperventilating and then end up in panic attack  yawning  depersonalised and utter doom  turn out i have costochondritis and slipping rib  and they do restrict my breathing  once again wa told it s stress and anxiety    i m sick of it  i ve seen many doctor and not even one of them ha ever apologised for not finding what is wrong with me  only trough pushing for proper exam and testing i have figured it out    because no one had figured out i have costochondritis and slipping rib they thought it wa my asthma worsening  so i wa given new med  these med sent into wave of panic attack with very high heart rate and heart palpitation  i ended up on the er  wa told it s anxiety   this wa many week in a row  daily  heart rate wa     in rest  i googled the med and figured out this wa the number one side effect of this med  it said they should immidiatly be stopped if this occurs  so i rang my specialst and she said it s indeed possible  i stopped the med and problem were over    i don t trust health care one bit  yet i need them for all my condition  i feel i ve been

167,this is my first time posting here and i really wanted to share my story    i am a    m and ever since i wa in my early teen i always loved smoking weed with my friend  at party etc  this past year ha been extremely stressful for me due to my final year at school and exam  due to the extreme stress i ve turned more towards marijuana  and started smoking occasionally by myself which i ve never done before  i wa always able to enjoy the high and i haven t had any bad experience with smoking before so i wa smoking away my stress casually every other day  summer holiday came around and after not getting the grade i wanted i decided to take a long holiday to visit my family  whilst being there for   week i smoked probably     of the time which i didn t think much about at the time  however  my second day back at home just before going to uni i decided to smoke with my friend  i had a few hit and then proceeded to pas out  i woke up with my heart racing and decided to go home  went to sleep and woke up in the middle of the night with the most intense panic attack  believing i wa going to die    this constant feeling of being on edge  wa the most painful and overwhelming sensation i ever felt  to the point where my mom would have to sleep with me because i wa in a constant state of paranoia  fortunately  my girlfriend just came back from a family holiday a well a i managed to get a psychiatrist to help me with my condition  he diagnosed me with pd and prescribed me gabapentin for the physical symptom which besides making light headed  helped a ton  after   week of taking the medicine i wa off to university and started to become better a the constant feeling of being on edge slowly faded    about two week into uni i started experiencing really intrusive thought about various thing  but mainly about going crazy and developing a major illness like schizophrenia  i did what everyone tell you not to do and researched the symptom and a soon a i saw some that i wa experiencing i fell down a rabbit hole  from then on i ve been constantly checking every little noise  every weird thing i d see with the corner of my eye  i ve been going over social interaction  checking my thought and whether they are delusional or not  i have become terrified and at this point it feel like i am expecting to have a psychotic break  my panic attack also trigger episode of dr which doesn t help a i begin thinking i am going crazy because nothing seems proper even tho deep down i am aware this is just my anxiety trying to justify itself   i have also found myself to be more scared of contaminating my body  what i mean by that is whenever i cook something  shake hand with a stranger  brush my teeth  or even take thing from people like food  cigarette etc i have to check if it feel  right   in case i will have another month long panic attack like from the weed  i think it s the uncertainty that scare me  and since i didn t know what wa in the weed i also don t know what bacteria is on a cloth i just touched with my bare hand so i need to wash my hand a certain amount of time until i feel clean so i don t have another episode or in case i get some deadly illness  i am quite aware of this feeling and sometimes i am able to just say  fuck it what if it is gonna make me have a panic attack  make me die   but most of the time i just can t think that way  this doesn t help the fear of schizophrenia because it make me think i am having a delusion of some sort which drive my anxiety sky high   i am now on a waiting list to see another psychiatrist at uni  but this fear is really overpowering me right now  i have better day when i can go out and enjoy myself  spending time with my girlfriend who is really helping me get through this and the thought of being happy with her motivates me more to get better   thanks for taking your time to read this  i really wanted to write this all down and let other people see this  if you guy have any advice on managing this it would be much appreciated   ,anxiety

282,so  a said in the post title  trigger warning   i deal with panic attack revolving around suicidal ideation  in which i m fearful i ll kill myself due to a panic attack  and therefore have a panic attack  which make me even more fearful of that to the point where i  do  want to take that step just to make the feeling go away   i ve been dealing with this on and off over the last decade but over the last few month it s been completely destroying my life  i m currently seeing a therapist  but i don t feel a though much progress ha been made because i ll end up going through week wherein i don t experience panic attack at all  and then some that are plagued by them and i have to either spend a few day with family  or go to the hospital   i m currently dealing with the latter  and have been at my own place for barely two day and even the thought of going to bed make my gut churn   i know these feeling will pas and i ll go back to feeling some level of normalcy  but i have no idea how to go about actually working on this when the current therapy i m getting is the most i can afford  which is not much   and it s not providing the help that i need  in addition to me genuinely fearing taking my own life   to be honest i m venting a bit here  but i m curious if anyone ha similar experience with panic disorder and this sort of looping association between the trigger and the panic itself  with both feeding into each other relentlessly ,anxiety

357,i wanted to update you guy on my treatment plan because i have been seeing massive success on managing my symptom of panic and anxiety    currently  i am on    mg of pristiq and       mg of vyvanse  depending on the day and need for the medicine     my doctor prescribed vyvanse  a adhd medicine that work differently than other similar medication such a adderal and ritalin  i wa nervous about taking vyvanse and allowed the perscription to stay in my drawer for around two week until i couldn t handle my racing thought anymore    everyday  i wa dealing with racing thought that would cause me anxiety  i would go from      incredibly quickly without any pause in between  likewise  i wa irritable because of all the scenarious in my head and had a hard time listening to fact  essentially  i wa making mountain out of molehill and wa making myself exhuasted    so  i decided to take vyvanse to see if i could become more productive and holy shit    when i say that this medicine ha helped me regulate my emotion and panic i am not lying  my thought are not a scary or deep anymore  i don t ruminate about certain situation a much and am able to just let thing go    my anxiety is doing so well  i m not panicked by thought of death or dying and my hyperfixation on breathing ha significantly lessened    of course  vyvanse is not perfect  i ve noticed that my sex drive ha increased  i m very aware of my body now and i get turned on a lot easier to an embarassing degree  it isn t all bad though   my alone time ha gotten a lot better lol    likewise  insomnia is the biggest issue i ve had and i ve had to start taking gabapentin at night to help me go to sleep  i also have a little  crash  around midday and become tired after taking vyvanse  but i think that s because it provides a calming effect    so here is my suggestion  if you have adhd and are not treating that because you re afraid the med will mess with your anxiety   try it    i swear  the first couple of day did increase my anxiety but then after that   it wa like nothing ,anxiety

360,so after oding on cough medicine in february  i ve been having panic attack daily with only a prescription for xanax which only acted like a bandaid  my doctor a of   week ago prescribed me paxil for my pd and since then i ve never had a panic attack since then thank god  but i ve had weird symptom    before being prescribed paxil  a i wa having a panic attack  my leg would give out or be weak and shaky    while i m at work on paxil relieved of panic attack  i ll still experience weak leg and it feel like my body all over like my nervous system tingle and feel electrified and twitchy spasm y   i tell my bos at work everything about my medical condition med status because he s fascinated by it  and i he knew about my pd before and experienced having to deal with me having untreated episode besides xanax  so after i started taking paxil and my pd stopped  he wa happy  but during that i noticed pd symptom without an actual panic attack  racing heart i cut out caffeine for over a month   and brain fog  but other physical trait of a panic attack without actually experiencing a panic attack is weak leg and a clenched jaw grinding teeth with my whole body feeling electrified    after i told him how i wa feeling  i said  brb i m gonna hold an experiment  and dug into my purse and fished out a  mg xanax  half an hour later  i felt normal again    so even tho it s been   week on paxil and it take     week to fully regulate in your system  should i keep toughing it out with occasional xanax relief  or should after   month my doctor appointment  ask if i need a higher dose of paxil  currently at the lowest dose of   mg daily    thank you so much for your input ,anxiety
