0,i started feeling bad last april  and it hasnt really ever gone away  i just have this horrible feeling of hopelessness or existentialism about the future  and this underlying sadness  i feel like i carry it with me all the time  and even when i distract myself it will never go away  i kind of feel le connected to my body in a way  like im not exactly living the same way i used to   the holiday were weird because it wa nice to see my family  but i felt like i wasnt fully present most of the time  i feel spacy and weird  this morning i woke up and couldnt get out of bed for over an hour and a half  and i havent done anything else  i have a really hard time talking to my family about this  i guess i just wanted to know if anyone else ha felt similarly  and did it start seemingly without a reason  one of the thing i struggle with most is feeling like it not enough to be depression i dont want to self diagnose  advice or support would be so appreciated,depression
1,in      i graduated from highschool  and a few month after got a job that s amazing  simply put is a place where we build machinery for sterilising medical equipment  and my job is mainly to assemble the electronics of them plus other implant  that s great  that s the field i graduated in  and it doesn t require a lot of strength  i m an underweight guy and i m skinny  so that s a win for me   but i really can t enjoy doing it  or doing everything at all  my job is really brain heavy and requires a lot of management skill  thing that i really don t have  plus i can t keep up with my coworkers speed  and my coworkers made me notice that s not the best thing if i want to get hired  but they all are pretty chill with me other than my tutor  he basically is the only dude  other than me  that doe that job  and i m supposed to learn everything i need to be independent from him  and that s fine  he isn t the best teacher  he isn t the worst  he put passion in his job so it s easy to learn  but when it come to me i just suck  i m slow at completing task  it take me time to process what i need to do  i m clumsy and i easily get lost even if i keep trying to do my best  my tutor heavily dislike this  and i m three month in  the month left before the higher ups will choose if they want to hire me or not  so it would be nice if i started being productive and not how i am now  he constantly get mad at me for not being a good a him  for being much slower than him and he pretty much told me he doesn t me to get hired and that he will do everything he can to not get me hired   everytime i hop in the car to go to work i just speed all the way  it is just   minute from my place though  just to feel somehow better about going there  and when i go back home i speed even more because i just want to go back to sleep and not have to think about that shitty place and my shitty tutor who is barely older than me  but it s not only my job  i can t really enjoy any activity   i don t hang out with friend because i only have like   of them and they have other friend group to hang out with  i spent new ear eve at home cry because i had no friend to be with  i don t have any passion or hobby  sometimes i just waste day playing videogames to distract myself  but i don t play for enjoyment  and on the few occasion i hang out with someone i just feel overwhelmed by everything and just wish i didn t go outside  i constantly feel like my mind is foggy  when i have to go somewhere with my car that isn t my workplace i get bellyache and need to rush to the bathroom  even thinking about it make me    even right now my stomach hurt  i just feel like i am a burden to everyone around me because i m so useless and slow and i overthink too much and can barely take care of myself  even taking a shower becomes a chore to me because i don t want to leave my bed  and even when i shower  twice a week so at least i can keep myself from being smelly  i take a lot of time in it just staring at myself or letting hot water running trough my body  i have always been like that  ever since i wa a child i had no social ability and it took me a lot to process thing and complet the most basic task  there wa a time where i wa so overwhelmed that i couldn t do    plus    i wa maybe   or   so that wasn t definitely alright   my family always told me that i show no emotion or excitement   and that s been going on since i wa like    so that leaf thinking that i have no mental health issue at all and that all of my problem in fitting into the world are my fault because i m the way i am  and if i were normal it wouldn t all be so hard  that s what i always repeated to myself since i wa a child  but i really hope somehow thing could change  at least marginally  is it possible or i am simply stuck with how my brain is wired and simply go on and say  that s how it is  at least i have a bed to sleep in so i can t complain  ,depression
2,you know deep down inside what it is but you rather not say it out loud because it set in a reality  youve held it down inside a long time when you wa a teen even  but being a black man you always been told  therapy is for white ppl you just need to pray on it  you tried the prayer but the evil thought still arise  until it overtaken your entire being and you start to finally feel something inside when you see the blood run across the thin piece of steel  it get to the point it too many line and it summer time so it hard to wear long sleeve in this heat  but youre stubborn and love the way it give you a sense of calming and feel of being an actual human being so you keep it up  you use the excuse your a wrestler so wearing hoodies in    degree weather is just to help keep my weight down  but nobody is none the wiser the darkness you carry in your heart everyday because you always put on a smile or stay stone cold face a to never let anyone know you hurt everyday and you do this for year  youve gotten so good at killing the show of emotion to pain  suffering  happiness even nobody is ever sure what you are feeling and it what you always wanted so you wont ever feel like you are a burden to anyone and youre the one that anyone can confide in because you dont show any emotion to if it wa a good or bad decision just a listening ear  over time you get married  youve mentioned it to her once youve had episode of mental weakness when dating but that wa year ago  shes surely forgotten about it  youre the husband the one who is the protector the one who is the strongest  at least thats what you were taught growing up men dont show emotion it sign of weakness  which is engraved in your brain  you take that emotion and shove it deep down inside  because nobody really care about a black man in america if he doesnt become a provider and protector or put on a good show for his peer  just another n word at the end of the day  you think after year of being married theyd notice you arent happy now or there something off  who know maybe they do notice but youve been so good at pretending everything is always fine and dandy a not to worry them because you know how theyll react and it always extreme so the look you give em never is a look of concern  the darkness slowly ha been seeping in wondering when is the best time to finally turn off the light for good  but then you have a child and you look into their eye and see the brightness that the world hasnt dulled yet  give you a bit of hope still to hold on to see what change he can do for the world  but that feeling end the day after you leave the hospital  urge never stop youre tired of life  you want to end it all  baby wont stop cry you havent slept in   day  you have no idea what youre doing  you lose all motivation to do what you loved to do in your spare time  your life is now completely revolving around your child and it may sound selfish but it ha made the darkness worse than ever  you dont even love yourself so how can you truly love a tiny human  you think to yourself it can all be over in a second with that lil device downstairs that can solve your debt and your own issue  your family is    k richer and you get forever silence  ive contemplated for year on this but im not strong enough to actually go through with it at this point  i know this wa a lot of randomness ,depression

11,i understand that she is gone  no doubt about that  but im not sad  i understand that it is something that happens in life and you have to accept it  but i want to feel bad about the situation like the rest of my family  i cant help my mother because how i see it is that we have to move on  it wa bound to happen one day  it wa just a matter of which one    i feel horrible that i never tried to reach out to her or even check up on her  she wa even in our house for her last week on hospice and i only talked to her a few time  but i hated to see her that way  i could walk around care free and do what i want while she sits there and suffers  it wa not fair to me at that time    i think about her every day  but part of me doesnt think she is completely gone  i think every holiday she is still gonna go out of her way to wish me great luck  but my   th birthday is coming up and it the first time i wont get a text about how proud of me she is  i know she still is deep down but now i dont have the reassurance that she doe   i know this all sound like the stage of grief  but i feel no grief if that make sense  just guilt  that maybe if i would have called or texted she would have not declined in health so bad  most of all i lost the only person who truly understood me  i could tell her anything and she would just listen  and im sure she is doing just that right now but without her there it just not the same    i didnt cry when i walked in on her dead body in the living room  my mother in tear on the floor  i just stood there in denial and said i loved her and went into work like nothing happened  why did i react that way  i wanted to cry but no tear would come  and whats even more weird is she wa the first family death i have ever witnessed  and i didnt even react like a normal human being ,depression

14,im not sure if this is appropriate to post here  if it not ill delete it but basically the way time is passing ha really hammered in the feeling that im on borrowed time  it      now  and ive always felt very strongly about      being the end for me  being hit with the realization that thats now just two year away feel really weird   lately i wonder if im even going to make it to that  i need to preface this by saying im not in any kind of immediate danger  but j find that im not really scared to die anymore and absolutely nothing brings me any joy anymore even in small way    i used to cope by spending a much time a possible around friend but now i just feel horrifically lonely and isolated around them  im always holding back tear when im around them and im worried ill just start cry in front of them soon  i dont even really think itd matter very much to them if anything happened to me though  especially lately because i obviously havent been a fun to be around because it harder to hide than it used to be  but ive never really fully fit in with them if i act like myself  im always kind of adapting and putting on an act  i thought it wa because im autistic but we have another friend in our group that is and they seem to fit in fine  i just feel really lonely and it doesnt help   and i thought i outgrew the im a burden and should die thing a a teenager but it definitely creeping back up  i just feel so deeply and horrifically sad all the time that it scary  im used to emptiness but this is worse  im not in any immediate danger like i said  but ive just been ruminating a lot about how i really dont think im going to make it,depression

25,      cardiac phobia   heart attack phobia by kamran sharif       bismillah rahman al rahim assalam alaikum friend  i hope you all will be well  in today blog  we will talk about cardiac phobia or heart attack phobia  a heart attack will come and he will leave this world he also died of heart disease he also died of heart disease and this one who is going to die he died of heart disease you too will die of a heart attack one day god forbid something like this happens  there may be many reason for it to happen  i will share some of the reason in front of you in this blog  you must read about how to deal with  panic attack  http   kamranwrites com how i coped my panic attack   and secondly what is the difference between apanic attack and a heart attack which is my video you a must watch these two video will clear your concept which are the symptom of a  panic attack  http   kamranwrites com how i coped my panic attack    there are people who link it to the hard attack that caused them to develop it and develop a cardiac phobia about it for the rest of their life after it wa born  and why god forbid  this may be true for anyone  there may be many reason for it      cardiac phobia symptom       suppose one day you were taught that you didnt know it wa a panic attack  you noticed that your heart rate increased  your breathing became heavy  your stomach twitched  your hand and foot began to twitch  when you feel like youre going to die  you get caught in that situation  then the second thing is that you see someone having a heart attack and you think one day it going to happen to me and the third thing you heard about someone who so and so got a heart attack  when you heard the listener  he said that he felt such a heartbeat  chest pain  and shortness of breath so you held this thing or you saw it in a movie  if you saw anything on tv  you caught it  usually  we who go into  anxiety  http   kamranwrites com anxiety by kamran sharif    we link small thing  and we make association because we are very sharp learner  thinking more deeply  the brain doe more work on when you heard the listener  he said that he felt such a heartbeat  chest pain  and shortness of breath  so you held this thing or you saw it in a movie  if you saw anything on tv  the brain remembers association        it quickly remembers one thing next to another  such a  say  your mother handmade lentil  you like rice very much  if you eat dal and rice from anyones hand  you will remember your mother in your mind that my mother make better than that  so it easy for the brain to remember thing because the law of memorization is that it link thing to remember  so it our brain that make link  it connects with itself and leaf with others  give  break this thing with anyone  then we are master  for this work we have done ph d   we have got degree  so now let talk about what is the reason behind this  for that  youll have to look at neurolinguistics programming nlp   im doing a series of our train your brain  also  this thing that wa work wa an experience  we paired meaning with that  and then our emotion with that  what happened then what wa our result and what behavior happened then they entered our belief system now whenever we get any news about someone or whenever we ourselves are a little panicked then immediately we associate this thing first  that i had a heart attack now i am having a heart attack and for a while  you will feel exactly the same even though i have seen many people who have a cardiac phobia  they check the pulse and when the pulse is fast  they think that they are going to have a heart attack  if so you can watch my video to know more about it     story of cardiac phobia       now i share a small study and story of a cardiac phobia before you that i have such prince i have a brother very dear brother i have a lot of love for him we have a lot of coordination and he is a very big person  they are good people who we respect and love  they donate alot to our mumtaz sharif trust  i have never seen such a person whom allah ha given money and heart to donate to someone  most people think that this money is my money  i like those people who help others  they are good people who work for others  now these people who were brother  one day they had a  panic attack  http   kamranwrites com how i coped my panic attack    mashaallah  they are an industrial person  when the kit came to them  their heartbeat went fast  start chest pain and shortness of breath they connected this with a heart attack  now they are afraid of this thing  and this guy get his blood pressure checked twice a day at the place where a normal person would check  cant do up so their fee are so high  so this guy spent thousand of rupee to check his blood pressure and he ha more than a hundred  ecg  http   en wikipedia org wiki electrocardiography   electrocardiography     amp  x   b         every time i had the same thought that the doctor did not check properly  the doctor did not do it properly  yes  he did not understand  he doesnt know what ha been done to his heart  whole body test were done  everything wa normal  there wa no problem anywhere  the problem wa only in a neuro programming  there wa no other treatment for him  alhamdulillah brother  he followed my word and alhamdulillah is a great favor of allah that after a long time now he understands that all these thing have come under his control  if they can do it  i can do it  then why cant you do it  my friend  allah ha made every human being equal  just a little change ha come that some people use their brain more  some people use their brain more  reduces the use of brain is also with each person  but each person ha made the wiring of the brain and it connection separately  so you can also train your brain  this is our series where everyone should use their brain more and be their own coach  be their own mentor  be their own counselor  heal themselves  i know you  i know you can do it  and i think that a human being can do anything  this is my own belief  so the belief system we have created  the thought pattern we have created  we can change it  i dont say that  that can be changed very easily  i must say that you can change by doing  it should be done so much that usually this person may take a year or year if you follow these thing  this is the solution  i tell you again in the video  first of all  work on your physical condition  for that  improve your diet  you will have to sleep well  you will have to exercise  you will have to do running  you will have to pray to allah  allah will have to ask for help  whoever is a muslim should ask allah for help and whoever is a non muslim should be united with his faith  because the belief system is the strongest system in the world  how can i not say this  a person writes that one of his relative got cancer  he tried many treatment and went to many doctor  but this cancer wa not cured anywhere  a son wa passing by a road  he found a piece of wood which according to his belief wa a cross  he brought the cross home and he cleaned it and gave it to his father and said that it is very old  he prays  his prayer is accepted  and whatever disease he ha  his disease is cured  seeing that person ha become  tell me where that power wa  wa it in that cross  not in that belief  now what did that belief do in him  this thing ha not been understood a science till today  so this is a great and very rare thing of science that allah ha given u  and we should take full advantage of it most of the people cant take advantage of it  instead of making it their friend  they make it their enemy  saying  my brain doesnt work well  yes  my brain is damaged  god forbid  someone mind is damaged  you cant fix it  if you find mistake  the flaw are within you and not within anyone else  you are it rider  you are it mentor  you have to design a pattern for it  ha to design a pattern for it and please remember one small thing  friendship  love  love  good morning  and boycott people who give you such news and declare your anxiety triggered  so and so had a heart attack so and so had a heart attack so and so had this happen to so and so shall i tell you a little story  brother  i got tired of explaining to them  there were people in their company  they were somebody or something if the person is giving such news to him  he would call me every day and he would get worried every day saying  dude  this is what this person ha to say  please wait a little longer  so  distance yourself from such people because if you tell them that you have a phobia  then they will tell you such news knowingly that this guy should be disturbed somehow because he himself ha this phobia  if you are not in agony then they dont know what is going through you so for a while  boycott whatever trigger it is  if it is happening due to any news  it is happening due to anything  then analyze it first and stand a little and see for yourself why it is happening  if yes  reduce it for a while  anything can happen  in some case  we check the blood pressure  in some case  we check the heart rate  so reduce these thing for a while  this thing can come under your control  besides you write down all the experience  what wa my condition when it happened to me the first time or what happened to me when it happened to me the second time  it work on visuals  what i work on is negative image  they have more power  they capture u more      how to stop worrying and start living   dale carnegie       they are more connected to our feeling and our behavior  you have turned every negative image into a positive  there is only one way to turn a negative image into a positive  there is only one way to turn a negative thought into a positive  what option will give to either do flat or do flight and or be and one which is my thing which i think is the most important thing is that you smile at it it will be like that it doesnt matter like that it will happen  i dont care if it happens  you have to relax yourself a much a possible  on the contrary  there is a rule that is from dale carnegie book   how to stop worrying and start leaving  http   en wikipedia org wiki how to stop worrying and start living   in it  he say  what will be worse than the first thing that is bad  google  accept the bad from the bad  please make the bad from the bad to good  try to do it  believe u  we will do it  it will also relax you a lot  now  another important thing that turn a negative into a positive is visualization  now  instead of panicking  visualize yourself first  the experience wa that it wa your first day and you had a panic attack in the evening  from where it all started  from where this phobia started  now you started changing image one by one  visualization will have to be done  i have made more  video  http   www youtube com channel ucu aey yf iggzmwuonjgta    i am giving you a basic overview of this  what will happen to this phobia  a an accusation  when you had a panic attack for the first time  you answered it  diya linked it to his panic phobia and his cardiac phobia  i will show you a short video of it  how to end it  let me tell you the same thing that make your face smile  you should know that this thing is irrelevant to me  even now  you dont pay attention to the thing that are not important for you  so first breathe in through your nose five time and release through your mouth  very nice very good  attack came to breathe through the nose  smile face  release through the mouth very nice very good you were sitting you had a panic attack you had to keep telling yourself that it wa a panic attack no problem it wa a momentary feeling very nice very good keep doing it slowly then you when i did this  everything wa normal  run it slowly  now when i run this image again  keep shrinking the image  keep making it smaller and finally you will have a black screen in front of you  there is no movie playing in front of you  there is no subconscious  so it will happen slowly  in some case it will take     day  in some case it will take     day and in some case it will take a hundred day and inshallah  it will be fine  but the thing is that the name of doing it is to keep doing it  these thing are not too difficult  they are not impossible  it is difficult  but it is not so difficult  allah will make everything alright see you can research these thing i have learned these thing by researching a lot in life and it took a long time now if you will give me a little time to learn these thing  you will learn much better than i can  so let u end the video  may allah give you health to every human being and whoever is traveling

98,hey everyone  i m looking for some advice on how to best approach a situation i ve found myself in  hopefully from people who have been in the same position  around     month ago my     m  relationship ended with my then girlfriend     f  due to her mental health  it wa a very loving  balanced  and healthy relationship up until the last couple of week  when she began having concern about her mental health in response to the extreme workload she wa facing that semester at school  she became increasingly withdrawn from everyone in her life  and told me that she wa feeling constantly stressed  overworked  and in general emotionally numb  we tried to make adjustment to the relationship but unfortunately her symptom continued to worsen  culminating in a diagnosis of moderate depression and general anxiety in mid october for which she wa prescribed anti depressant    at this point we had an conversation about what she needed and decided mutually that it would be best if we ended our relationship  albeit for different reason  i wa worried about the strain maintaining the relationship would put on her  while she seemed more worried about it being unfair to me to give her all this support and how i deserved better   we both expressed how we wanted to be together but couldn t and seemed hopeful that someday maybe we could try again  but right now my one and only concern is helping her get to a point where she can love herself again  her support circle is very small so i made it clear that i would continue to be there to listen and help however she needed  and have been sending periodic text every couple week or so asking how shes doing  wishing her well  or offering to do something simple like go for a walk  she doesn t always respond  which i know is pretty typical during depressive episode  but when she doe she always thanks me for reaching out offering to do something   with it being christmas break  all of our friend who go to school out of town are returning and naturally i have been catching up with them  only one of them know the full extent of what happened  but there ha been a common thread between all of them  she randomly stopped talking to them over a month ago and all of them have given up trying to reach out to her  at this point the only people she seems to have contact with are her immediate family  her roommate  and myself    this is where my dilemma come in  i want to continue to reach out  to make it known that people are thinking about her and that she matter to someone  especially in the face of her now increasing isolation  but at the same time i m worried about her optic of this  that i m just a clingy ex trying to drag her back into a relationship or someone wasting their energy on her when she doesn t deserve that care  i know people say that when a friend becomes isolated with depression  the best thing you can do is to be patient  continue to reach out  and be there when they are ready to go back to the life they once knew  but despite the fact that we ended on good term and the fact that we were friend for year before dating  i can t shake this feeling that it s just not appropriate for me to be taking on this role    deep down i feel like standing by her is the right thing to do  and it worth the risk that she may have a negative outlook on me for it  i know supporting someone through mental health challenge is a long and exhausting process  but i am in a good place mentally and have a strong support network of my own  that coupled with my professional make me feel that i am equipped to do this  i don t know  i guess i m just looking to hear what other people who have been in this position on either side did or felt  sorry for the long post ,depression
99,so a little background  rant   plea for help and advice    my mom is    year old  she is very wealthy  hasnt had to work in many many year  she ha two kid  grown adult living independently but close by for year   basically ha everything she need  my dad ha worked his whole life and gave her everything  they have been faithfully married over    year    she is very kind and loving and a beautiful person inside and out  but she is a very insecure person  and she often project that onto others making everyone else to blame for her problem and insecurity    my mom is depressed  but the problem is  she wont do anything to get out of her depression  she doesnt exercise  she doesnt volunteer  she doesnt do anything productive  she doesnt have a social life either  she doesnt cook for herself other than the occasional ready made junk she throw in the oven  occasionally she cook for the family but it is rare  and then she apologizes for being an  incompetentcook  cue the insecurity even though the food is usually great   then she want so many compliment and still feel inadequate  her word  and whatever other negative term she us for herself  idk if it bc she truly feel that way or if it that she want to make excuse to not make dinner for the family  nobody shame her for not cooking and we all praise her many time in the event that she doe    she blame everyone else for not making her happy or for her always putting herself on the back burner for everyone el need and happiness  again she is just living with my dad and we rarely ask her for help in the sense that she is inconvenienced long enough to put herself on the back burner for u to stop her life or chance of making her own happiness   it is not our job to  make  her happy or provide her with the fun and happiness that she is lacking  although that is what she expects based on past conversation  we spend time with her when we can  at least once or twice a week     she spends way too much time on tiktok which i think ha fueled her downward spiral and depression or perceived miserable life  she doesnt make an effort to go outside and exercise  not even something a simple a a walk in the many beautiful trail she ha within a    minute drive of her house    my family and i have tried to encourage her to go start exercising  get fresh air  go volunteer and do anything productive which will ultimately make her feel good but she keep saying yah maybe i should or oh i dont have time do do that with everything going on  even though she really doesnt have much of anything going on  hence the boredom and depression and lack of excitement in life   she tends to brush off anything that would benefit her mentally and physically  shes always looking for a quick fix like medication or surgery    she ha been on antidepressant basically her whole life and she ha done relatively well on them  but now it seems she isnt able to pull herself out of her dark hole    what should i do  how can i help her  i feel really sad seeing her in such a dark place but also angry and resentful of her lack of effort to do anything for her own physical and mental health   please help with any advice if you have dealt with a loved one similarly and had any success ,depression

139,so i m feeling really alone  a if being    year old and having denture and being on disability since      due to my mental health and not being pretty anymore and not having any friend or a significant other and being poor and only having a roof over my head because i have to reapply for rent assistance every year meaning i would be homeless if rent assistance weren t granted to me  and so much else  today i went and deactivated my twitter account  which aside from me newly joining reddit  wa the only social medium i had used for several year    now i m realizing how very much social medium can fill in the empty space in life and make the void seem not so terribly empty  so i left twitter today  my final form of social medium  and i literally feel like i ve lost a limb  like i m withdrawing from a drug  like i m more alone than i ve ever been in my entire life   the one beautiful thing about me is that i m a really good writer  and my poetry  in particular  ha always been alliterative  rich with imagery  always powerful and intensely meaningful but also raw and anguished  much of it is about failed relationship  lost love  so what do i always do but share my poetry with men i m drawn to in hope that it will make me seem special and worthy of their attention  but i m such an idiot because poetry like mine doesn t make people love me  it just scare them away from me  it just make them see how very broken i am  why on earth did it take me    year to figure this out   so there is this man on twitter who happens to write and record amazingly clever and funny parody song  he only started tweeting them recently so i basically happened to be his first fan  or one of his very first fan  we had talked a bit in direct private message  one day he sent a heart emoji to me  i wa so happy  then i shared a few of my poem with him  the next day he wouldn t even talk to me  except briefly  in a dry  emotionless way    so once again i humiliated myself in the same way i always do  never seeming to remember from time to time how or why i end up where i do  and since i seem to find an infinite number of opportunity to do this on social medium  leaving twitter  removing myself from all access to making an idiot out of myself in this way and driving people away from me  seemed like the best thing to do   so i sent a brief and gentle goodbye message to this man before leaving twitter  after all  he wa my only follower  then  he sent the word  happy new year  back to me  not even an exclamation point included  and that wa all  the vast expanse between a heart emoji and a few ice cold empty word which if anything seemed to convey relief to be rid of me  but now i m sounding melodramatic    anyway  if i ve learned anything  maybe  finally  a word of advice is to please not go through life sharing intensely personal and painful poem with people whom you hope will love you only to be devastated when they shut you out and leave  what i seem compelled to do never end well  it just end up in new year eve like this one is for me  more alone and lost and sad than i may have ever really been  thanks for listening ,depression
140,hi  i m writing this a i dont know what to do with myself anymore  i think this will prob be a long post so sorry in advance   i m   m  although most of the event i m writing about happened when i wa       i dont have any friend irl and i m awful at socialising so i often meet new people to talk to via reddit and discord  in      i met a girl from reddit and developed feeling for her  she lived in another country  but we texted and called a lot  we started a relationship soon after meeting   long story short  she wa a manipulator and compulsive liar  emotionally and mentally abused me and cheated on me  there is a lot more detail that i m leaving out  but for several month i wa in a very bad place with her and it created a lot of trauma for me   eventually i got out and ended it for good  and while i never looked back i spent a long while depressed and hung up over her   the only way this eventually dissipated wa when i met someone knew  also in another country  and begun a relationship with her  i felt closer to this girl than i ever had to anyone before  trusted her with my life and genuinely believed we would get married eventually   but because of the past trauma i found myself becoming more controlling and toxic  mainly out of fear that she would cheat on me or leave   in the end it wa this that pushed her away to breaking up with me about    hr ago  it broke me  i made so many mistake that i will forever regret  but it s over now and i accept that   i just find myself back now in the depression  it feel like it broke me  there are glimpse of happiness but my general mood is depression  emptiness  cry all the time and loneliness   i m scared i ll never find someone  or that i will and i ll fuck it up again   this post ha been a mess sorry  but i just want to be happy again  i want to know if there is anything i can do or try to be happy  especially to be happy on my own and not jump back into another relationship   i just want to get better and stop feeling like this   thank you all for reading  i really appreciate any advice you can give     ,depression

150, i am a brazilian  so if my english is not that great i am sorry    i am in a situation that i can t relax  my mind is overflowing with toughts that i despise  so i will resume my story to explain my current situation  i wa born with autism and i don t know about til my late    and i wa bullied at the school for not being  normal   in those year i have dificulty interacting with others and wa very oblivious to my surroundins   in that time i couldn t understand and fit in some group in that time i wa very nerdy and couldn t talk about anything that wasn t cartoon game card game  and animal  so in a desesparation move i enter in a toxic friendiship with   person  in that time i don t identify that those person liked me for real  but i trusted them with my life beacause they were the only dude that don t despise me so i stuck to them  until i wa in the recess and see one of them stealing lunch from other kid  so i asked him why wa they stealing   he dont respond  i wa raised by parent that maked shure tha i should have a high moral standard so i being a oblivious child tell to the teacher  before asking why i made this with they  our friendship wa already being not that good  in the beginning we talked about lot of thing played soccer together  but a time after they changed  they start to enter into the edgy phase  discovering thing like violent show that were pure for the sake of violence  recent discovered about s  x  and i wasn  in that world  they watched that type of stuff on the internet and in that time my family couldn t afford to pay  so i wa telled that i wa a strange and that if i wanna stay talking to them i must know the subject  and i wa sometimes ridicule in front of others because i wasn t informed enough to hang out with them  so back to that i wa talking i talked to the teacher about that my friend wa stealing other kid lunch   so she talked to him  and when i wa going to get my lunch on the school refectory he and the other person on my group came and start argue with me about why i talked to the teacher about the stealing  in that time my comunication skill were terrible so in the end sound more like  stealing is bad   and after that they started beaten me one grab me by behind and the others hit me in the front the person in the refetcory doesn t care i wa being beaten  resuming in that time i had angry issue and some case i started screaming so i doesnt  had the best reputation  my anger issue in that time were big because of my feeling of defeat that i couldn t find a frien and that wa all my fault  and after all that i wa trowed into the ground and after that i lost contact with them  a few year later i made a friend when a i wa in  th grade i will name her f  she wa being bullied too by the kid because she wa a very quiet person and doesn t talked that much  one day i wa sitting in my desk and start i conversation with her about a dumb subject i guess it wa about color of sock  and she for a strange reason talked back  we talked every day since that day  but a few month later she went to other school beacause she couldnt bare to being bulied in the class so i lost my only friend and i stayed alone til the  th grade  in between that time my grandma that i wa very  close to died  and trowing salt on the wound i remenber i wa cry in the hall and one of my teacher came and asked why i wa cry  and i reply that my grandma died note she died   week before my birthday  and he went and talked that i wa being childish and i have no reason to be cry and anoying others  but the breaking point for me wa the time that would have a theater and in the back of the school they will open a  pizzaria  so to anounce to the class my history teacher talked like  student we will have a pizza night this x day and the price of the pizza will be x  but i couldn t hear the price so i aske if she could say again because i don t wanted my parent to spent a lot of money with me and i wanted to support the theater  but her response wa not what i wa expecting  she sayed that i wa being very obnoxious and that my autism wa not an excuse to irritate other people  i don t get what she sayed  so i came home and talked to my mother and she became furious with the teacher beacause wa not the first time the school mistreated student with autism  i asked why she wa furious and my dad came and explained for her  i started bursting into tear beacause i wa born with something that made other person despise me for being the way i wa i thinked that way until i almost graduate highscool  from that day i started to develop trust issue anxiety  and suicidal thought  i wa brought to therapy that i still doing to this day  i almost commit suicide that year but if wasn t by my amazing and caring parent i woudn t be alive

though    for starter i am    f  married without kid  i started developing depressive symptom around    year old  by    i had already developed a very strained relationship with my parent and someone at school wa mocking me  i started with  tw  self harm around that time  due to my parent being jehovah s witness i couldn t really make friend at school  i only had one friend through chat  i knew him irl  and my cousin  eventually my cousin fell in love with me  we spent lot of time together  he became my boyfriend  secretly  by when i wa     i did not believe in love  i didn t want love  i wa barely surviving  but i thought i had to be responsible with my relationship so i started working on myself  at    i ran away from home with him and my aunt  i finished highschool and started working  i got therapy too  pandemic hit and i lost my job  couldn t afford rent  my aunt moved to my little village to a tiny home so we couldn t move back with her  so my parent it wa  since they are very strict in term of moral we couldn t have any kind of intimacy anymore  we married shortly after because we were  i think mostly me  suffering a lot not being able to sleep together  a soon a we married my parent looked into buying a home for u  we found a nice tiny house that wa relatively cheap  the whole family contributed and now we have a house for ourselves  i wa extremely depressed because i couldn t pursue a career and my therapist convinced me to try anyways  scholarship are very common in my country  and last year i got to study my first year of graphic design  this year i wa not granted the scholarship among other issue so i m working   either way  when i fled my home it started to feel like life wa worth living  thing were looking up for me  when i moved back to my parent i overcame a rough patch but a few month later i somehow and suddenly gained a bit of strength and could finally  confidently say that i no longer wanted to die  at    year old   i wanted to live  well nowadays i m feeling like i just can t deal with being a human  it feel like no matter how hard i try i ll never be able to accomplish what a normal person can    i find it extremely hard to have a routine  i try to get up  eventually my bos call me and tell me the schedule for the day  i get up  my husband make breakfast and i leave for work  i deal with my bos  dirtiness  a tense relationship between my coworkers and my bos  i m sensitive so if there s fight near me i get super uncomfortable due to my upbringing     when i get home  i don t really work long hour so i m not physically tired  at all  my husband and i eat whatever he ha cooked  then we may take a nap and play some videogames together  some day my bos call me to work in the afternoon a well  however  the house is always super dirty  the issue is that i m not good enough that i have energy to clean after i get home from work  i try to get up earlier and help my husband clean but we don t have the motivation  or i suggest we both wake up and he doesn t immediately do it  i have to suggest it a few time  so that tire me out and i give up about it   i know you might be thinking  oh well  why doesn t your husband do the cleaning  the explanation is simple  he is going through a really rough patch  he ha been very depressed for a long while now  he is just incapable of doing it  he isn t able to maintain a job either  a bit over a year ago he started developing nausea and dizziness that made him lose his job  a few week ago he got a job at the school bus a the person that make sure every kid is on the bus and they are seated and arrive safely to home and school  the second day he got a panic attack and he wa fired  i don t work many hour so we barely make end meet  sometimes our family ha to help out a bit  to be honest  i m merely explaining the situation    he is a wonderful husband that ha done so much to help me in the past   i feel so powerless a i can t help him a much a he need during this time  i know people would be able to maintain a clean house while working even more hour than i do  when i get home after work and i se he hasn t done much i just feel all my strength leave my body  having a dirty house stress me out so much but i can t deal with it by myself  i genuinely don t know how can i become better  he deserves my support and i am too stressed and upset about other thing to be of much help  he got me super awesome gift for christmas and i only got him a videogame that he liked  i feel like a horrible wife that doesn t do enough for him  why can t i be like a normal person and just clean a little   the house get back to being a mess merely a day or two after we eventually get to clean  he is always kind and sweet and thoughtful  towards me  he really is wonderful but i can only support u financially and i don t even know how long will i be able to keep my job because when eventually my dysthimia  diagnosed by my former therapist  start making me show symptom in my work all of my boss start threatening me with firing me  or last year i had to get a mental health leave because of an incident at work   i am lacking in so many aspect  i can never see myself a a full functioning adult  right now i put some music and resolved myself to clean the house before going to work  my husband just left for a couple of day to celebrate new year s with his family while i chose to stay and work since im not sure i ll be getting much money the next january and february and i wanna get a bit extra for those month  but a i got to the kitchen i got overwhelmed and started to cry a to how overwhelming life is feeling lately  i ve been thinking on self harming again  even thought about overdosing  and i m scared i m relapsing again  i thought of going to therapy again but it s too expensive  the fight against depression is so hard i can t see how i can win    if anyone ha any suggestion or advice on getting thing done i would appreciate it  i d love to be able to let my partner heal in a clean and decluttered environment ,depression

164,when i joined reddit  i thought i d just be scrolling through post  occasionally liking post and comment that i really liked or that just spoke to me  i didn t actually think i d be posting or commenting  but here i am doing just that  i have absolutely no idea what i m doing  and i apologize for any typo and anything that is worded weirdly  i just want to get some thing off my chest    that being said  i ve been dealing with depression for a little under two year  which doesn t seem very long compared to other people  i m a    year old female and going into my last semester of college and nursing school  i guess the stress and rigor of being in college and nursing school really took a toll on me  but at least  i wa able to get by my first two year with not many problem  i m thankful for that    while it may also seem like a small amount and not very significant  i ve seen four different therapist  all of which did not help me very much  and tried three different medication within a couple month with the hope of finding one that work  each medication either didn t work or just made thing worse with unwanted side effect  i have just started my fourth medication  so i m hoping that this is the one that work  after my bad experience with therapy  i ve been hesitant to give therapy another try a i ve become wary and distrustful of therapist and therapy itself  truthfully  i have no hope for therapy and very low expectation for it  however  i genuinely want to get better  i really want to learn to identify trigger and learn how to deal with the symptom  which include thought of hurting myself and suicide ideation   i don t know what to do or where to go a i see therapy and medication a my only option  i ve been getting tired of going through medication after medication  and i am reluctant to give therapy another try  even though my boyfriend and friend have been urging me to seek therapy  the failure of the last four attempt at seeking therapy brought on this sense of hopelessness and helplessness  i see other people around me go into therapy  begin to work through and manage their problem  and see change and improvement  whereas i m still struggling at what seems like stage    i resent those people for doing what i can t  it s disheartening and crush what little self confidence and self esteem that remains  i know i should be happy for them for being able to seek therapy and see improvement in their mental health  but i just can t help but feel bitter and jealous  which just make me feel like piece of crap person  i feel like a burden  a waste of space  and a hopeless case because i just can t seem to find anything that work  i just feel like i m not good enough or that something is wrong with me   i don t have much hope for the future  knowing that i ll probably still be struggling to find help  while my fellow nursing student will go out and start their career a nurse after graduation  i feel like i will be hindered by depression  how can i care for others when i can t even care for myself  it feel like i will be a sorry excuse for a nurse  while my peer will eventually flourish and advance  i just don t know what to do anymore ,depression
165,i m no stranger to depression  i ve known it before i even fully understood what it wa  it s been with me longer than anything i ve ever known  it is the only consistent thing in my life  but for a long a i ve had it  i ve learned to cope  i ve forced myself to dream  to hope  to live beyond myself   i have objectively beautiful people in my life  my wife and   kid are the most wonderful thing i could ever hope to have  so why  then  am i hurting so much  i m writing this in the middle of a mental break that i m just trying to piece together why i have suddenly hit a breaking point  i m not about to word vomit all the angle in which i m feeling pressure  but suffice to say my life feel like it s dancing on a razor s edge and i am the quickly fraying thread  i feel like the pressure is ripping me across that edge  and i m barely hanging on  work  my family beyond my wife and kid  my complete lack of anyone physically or tangentially around i cam talk to  despite my best effort to make the right choice  to be the best version i can be  why doe it always seem to fall so short  the fruit of my life is so barren aside from my kid  but how do i face them a a father when i am so far from who i want them to see  how do i be the husband my wife deserves to have when i can t even get the word out that i am broken  i am so broken but i still have an obligation to hold it together for my family sake  i can literally feel my spirit being ground into sand in every moment of god forsaken silence  battered by the voice in my head on one side  and my crushing obligation on the other   i am slowly being milled into oblivion  milled into flour for the rotting bread the world continues to demand to consume of me  no matter how hard i try to carve my own path and be who i know i wa created to be  it s one more blow after another  like facing a tag team with only myself  going it solo wa never the plan  it wa my childhood greatest fear  being alone  and now i sit in a parking lot at    writing in a public forum because i don t have a single friend that i can turn to that i know would ride or die   before anyone get the wrong idea  my wife is amazing and absolutely supportive  and in term of most thing in life  she is my ride or die  but there are certain burden that no wife need to carry   i dunno  i guess that s all i have time to process for now  time to put on the smile and go be a dad husband now  maybe i ll add more later   hope the rest of you are doing better than i am right now ,depression

169,i ve  had a fair share of suicidal thought here and there during my teen  but eventually i started to get better so i never got psychological help for it  my final year of high school were actually full of joy  my grade were great and i had a very supportive group of friend  but at some point something happened and i m  not sure why  or even exactly when  i started to simply not feel good  it tore me apart because i thought i wa over it and there wa no apparent reason for it   i wa hurting because of nothing  i m wa an excellent student in h and have a very supporting family  but since i ve  gone to college i ve  been away from them and my grade have been going down  which is making everything worse    on top of that i ve  been drinking more than i should  and doing a bunch of drug  a well a engaging in some weird impulsive behaviour  i have never been much of a drinker and when i wa younger i wa very much opposed to it  but now everytime i go out i get absolutely  wasted  i get psychotic  breakdown everytime i smoke weed or do any substance of the sort  but i still end up doing it no matter how terrible i feel afterwards  i ve  been given a prescribed medication that i need to take due to my insomnia  but i ve  been abusing it and taking more than i should  to numb myself  i don t  understand  why i do it  since i ve been telling myself to stop many time  but every  time i do it i feel a though someone else is doing it  a though i m  on autopilot watching someone else taking  control of my life and ruining it  i ve  been thinking about taking my own life more frequently and intensely than before and this time i feel like i could really act on it and that scare me   i know i need to change   i know everything that ha been happening  is essentially  my fault  and i know i should probably seek help  but i don t even know where to start because i don t even know what s  going on with me  like i said  i just don t feel good and i don t know why  i wa a good kid  i had excellent  grade and a whole future ahead of me  why is this happening ,depression
170,it embarrassing a hell that something like that got me so upset  but it did   i wa watching a playthrough of a dating sim a little bit ago  it actually pretty well written with relatable character  then it get to the point where the guy and his girlfriend get  into it   and then it just went downhill in my head   it wasnt over the top porn stuff by any mean  it wa awkward a hell  two awkward and inexperienced    year old being each others first time  it wa purposely sloppy  had some bump along the way before it really got going  and didnt last at all  but the beauty of it for lack of a better term wa that i wa awkward  it felt more real  just two lovestruck teen experiencing a natural part of life  the fact that someone could be desirable and savvy enough to experience such a normal part of life with someone they love  the main character isnt any popular social butterfly by any mean  which just sting even more   i wont lie  it made me feel fucking horrible  it hit me in a spot that just caused me to crumble into piece and now i never wanna watch it or similar thing again  it reminded me that i have never in my life been with someone in any capacity  that ive never been good enough for anyone  that ive never had someone willingly choose me to experience such an intimate and natural occurrence and reminded me that many of my peer get to experience it just by being themselves  giving them the confidence and experience they may need to hope to experience again and to have more meaningful relationship and fulfilling intimate experience  it make me feel inadequate and like an overgrown child  it make me feel like i am totally behind and lesser than most people  it reminded me what my life could have been and what experience i could have acquired if i wa just more desirable to people  it wa like the virtual equivalent of cry yourself to sleep to the sound of moaning and bed pounding coming from your upstairs neighbor    it also just ruined the whole idea of watching dating sims and visual novel a a whole  i just feel too shitty and inadequate to gain any enjoyment out of them ,depression

216,hi community     amp  x   b   it s easier to type behind a computer than express my feeling to friend and family  there are people that understand  but to be fair  many people that don t go through symptom of depression are unable to understand the complexity behind the diagnosis    i feel like  i am trying  maybe not enough  because it s difficult to have any sort of motivation when apathy ha taken over  the amygdala hijack that s taken over is not my sympathetic nervous system but my parasympathetic  all i want  to do is rest    friend and family recommend exercise  believe me  i can barely move  and i would like to be that person that doe    i am in my late thirty and have big goal  yet when i get stressed and overwhelmed  my fight or flight response is to freeze  where the freeze are longer  i am currently experiencing a freeze of three month  where i am unable to get anything done    medication  i ve tried a handful of ssri s  snri s  natural remedy  therapy  yoga  meditation  mindfulness  hypnosis  emdr  fish oil  vitamin d  magnesium etc    i guess  what i am trying to say  is that i wish there wa a better way to have duality  and be the person that you re hoping and wishing to be  and the person that just want to relax  i am up for relaxing  but not for month at a time    medication work to a certain extent  they take the gutwrenching sadness and pain away  yet take the motivation to get anything done  so damned if you do  damned if you don t    how doe one  get their body and mind to work together  to accomplish a big goal  i am working on my bachelor s degree  then master s degree  but my body like to shut down when i am stressed  it s been a difficult journey    i rarely go on here  but wanted to put my thought into word  and thank you for reading     amp  x   b   hug,depression

225,since i    m   graduated high school  i ve taken everything a it came to me  i got a job after a couple of month and did it without complaint  that job left me behind to move somewhere else so i sat in my parent  house for   year straight doing nothing but watching anime  i didn t go out  i didn t barely talk to my friend  and i didn t really care to  college felt like a waste of time and it still doe   after those   year i had a sudden urge to just move out  halfway across the u  so i did  i guess i just felt like something might change if i did  but while i put myself out there by necessity and got job  i found myself doing the same thing i did at home  i became a recluse again pretty much instantly  i did try to socialize but i felt like people or maybe just me  weren t the same anymore  nobody wa a interesting  nobody wa like me not a in interesting  but like nobody had the same interest   i figured maybe it wa just the area i wa in   so after a good   month of trying something different  i went back home  feeling like nothing had changed  like before  getting a job wa the easy part for me  the job i still have now ha me working with people i grew up with  and i like these people  but again  even when i am around people that know me every day  i feel like i m just there  an npc in their world   since i first moved out i have everything i need in life and most of what i want  i ve never felt the need to have a lot of money or to have big dream  i m fine with being poor   i do feel alone all the time  though i do realize it s my own fault for the most part  when i m social  it s heavy and in short burst of confidence that fade quickly  this confidence went quadruple when i talked to a girl i liked  but apparently i m not very attractive which wa news to me when i wa told that because i thought i looked alright back then   so now my confidence is in the negative and i find myself cringing at the thought of trying to speak to a woman  and that lack of confidence wa kind of the straw that broke the camel s back  i used to keep a decent figure and now i m putting on weight and i have no motivation to work out  eat well  or care in general  everything is getting le interesting to me and i can tell  i keep having to find some kind of niche medium to interest me enough to keep me going but i can tell that i m running out and soon i ll just end up a husk   the problem a i see it is that no matter what i do  i m forever on a path to nowhere  and i don t care enough anymore to stray from it   thanks for reading  and if you have any advice for me i m glad to hear it ,depression

290,if you think of the richest person you personally know  it might be a doctor or a lawyer or some respectable profession   maybe someone who owns their own landscaping business or is the top    of selling car or real estate or something   but the thing is that they probably only bring in        k a year   while that is good money that can afford them a million dollar house and car and toy and hobby  in a moderate col area   they are no where near solid multi millionaire     i cannot believe there are people like music artist  onlyfans creator  youtubers  online course seller  etc  that bring in    s of thousand if not     s of thousand of dollar a month   how in the hell do some people just make that much money   it s disgusting  it s unfair  it s fucked up     why are they so lucky in life to be born with that type of personality  or with the genetics to have perfect tit and a pussy to sell nude of  or the voice that go well with whatever genre of music they create   why do they get so lucky   sure  they probably worked at it  no one becomes a rapper or popstar overnight  no one start an of and make a million their first month  no one start a youtube channel podcast and make million   but their work  combined with their natural gift make it possible   you and i cannot force creativity to make some artwork that sell for million  or creativity to make a youtube series that draw in million of viewer   it s something that you have to have within you from the beginning    it s not fucking fair how rich those people are  and then you go a step beyond that  there are ceo s  people who were born into wealth  big investor  etc that make     s of million a year  if not billion a year   elon musk made    s of billion in a single day from the price of tesla stock going through the roof   it s absolutely fucking disgusting how much wealth is getting concentrated in the top       of the world ,depression

292,hi  i m not in an emergency crisis situation  firstly  trans lifeline unfortunately couldn t get to me when i called  but i did get through to the trevor project and talked with a counselor for over half an hour today  anyways  i want to talk about a thought that occurred to me yesterday  something that i didn t bring up on the call because so much else wa weighing on me    so firstly  i m using betterhelp  please don t bash me for it  i got a free trial and it s the best i can do right now  my t is amazing except he s not a prompt responder at all  so i vent on reddit and use other helplines when my mind get dark  they also have live support group on zoom that you can attend with therapist that you don t work with  the two lgbtq  focused one i went to were really great  and i wa so surprised because i ve heard about severe homophobia amongst their professional  but one wa led by a lesbian  another by a nonbinary person  so i wa proud to see member of the community facilitating  but yesterday s wa a general group called  create your avatar  and it wa about constructing the person you most want to be in life  the woman who led it    she really talked from the perspective expectation that those of u attending had experienced little to no trauma in life  and i m not sure why  it s not like she doesn t know we re all in therapy  so she began to talk about how none of u would  want  to harm our younger self    year old self  she said   which ought to mean we  surely  shouldn t mistreat our present self  this is when the thought started pouring in for me  i started to feel panicked a i realized   but    i  would  harm my younger self  i would suffocate them  so he wouldn t have to endure future suffering   i knew it wa wrong  but what she wa saying i should be thinking just didn t make sense to me  so  i nervously voiced my concern  hoping she would tell me how to resolve it  instead  she completely ignored everything i said  it wa like i didn t even open my mouth to speak  and i can understand if it wa to minimize triggering anyone in the space  but she didn t even say that or tell me a single thing i could do to dispel my demoralized thinking   i guess it s just like    i feel discouraged about having so much further to go to get  better   or  i guess  i don t even know that i will  i left my abusive parent  house a month ago  and even though i m so relieved to be out and free  i still feel like  well  the metaphor that come to mind for me is probably a clich one  but i wa wayyyyy underwater  i wa fully drowned at their place  before i left  while imagining i d be leaving soon  i wrote   started from the bottom    now the surface is visible  the  light  is visible   and i wa right  i can see the sunlight now and my head broke the surface finally  but i kinda thought  once i reached this point  i would then float peacefully on my back and enjoy the sunshine on my skin  instead it s like  i m barely staying afloat  my arm are flailing and i m getting so tired of treading of the water that could pull me under at any moment  why is this  why can t all the good thing happening in my life be enough for my brain to    i dunno  wake up and smell the rose  all i can think about is my coldblooded god grandmother who said to me in may after a suicide attempt   your life is great  you have a loving family  you ve traveled outside the country  you do well in college  you have no reason to be depressed   i wish she d been right ,depression
293,the people who are supposed to be ride or die never are  we all have done something in our past that we are ashamed of  we all hurt others unintentionally  we try and be better and do better  build better life for ourselves  but there is no forgiveness  no coming back  those you love and trust will betray you and eventually weaponize everything you ever spoke in confidence  there is no use in trying anymore  i have done everything and lost everything too many time   dont ever trust anyone  ever  it      will bite you in the as ,depression
294,istg school  especially the french system  is absolutely horrible  in addition im in a private school so the pressure and all the work that we have to do is too much for me   recently i have finally been diagnosed with depression and i dont really know how to explain to my parent that i cant continue like that   i hope that one day ill have a break from all of this bc i cant anymore  and also the treatment is making me very weak ,depression
295,this is not a dramatic problem and my depression is mostly mild but still this thing make my life much worse than it could probably be   about a year ago i  a suggested by my therapist  decided to start going to gym  i asked the coach for help  i wa training three time a week for about  h  doing prescribed exercise   and most of the time i still felt terrible  worse and worse actually  instead of progressing and getting any satisfaction  over those six month i grew more and more frustrated and resentful towards this duty  many time  while trying to focus on the exercise  i got my mild psychotic symptom rage through my mind  many time while driving back from the gym  instead of feeling relieved or at least pleasantly tired  i wa looking for a tree to speed into  that s right   directly after the training  suicidality kicking in   in the gym it got surely the worst  seeing people around  comparing myself instinctively  noticing how they re younger  better predisposed  normal and healthy  i felt this crushing sense of inadequacy and shame  but even if i try to exercise alone in my room i usually get only frustrated and easily spiral into more self loathing  heavily dissatisfied with my result   in the past i wa bullied in school  pe and locker room were the worst moment of my life back then  i wa also ridiculed for my attempt at training outside school  that s probably a big part of the problem  but the therapist  being a passionate sport freak  couldn t really make sense of how i can feel so bad anyway  especially with much time passed  i wa    already    after about half a year of mostly maintaining good discipline  though having some fallback  mostly due to health issue and holiday season  with training at the gym  but staying unable to force myself into any real progress  i only hated it and finally snapped  stopped going  never came back   i wish i could stop being this fat clumsy weak slob  from time to time i try training again  sometimes beating my previous record in timespan of dedication  but each time i fail with zero success  and each time i end up hating myself more  for normal people exercising lead to feeling good  to satisfaction  i wish i could get a bit of that effect  but nothing help ,depression
296,i     f   just came out of a very long   gt    year  friendship  that had long had romantic undertone and turned explictely romantic in the end  i don t know if she ha always been depressed  but the depression became worse  then probably a bit better and worse again   we had a fight and didn t really talk with each other after that  i tried initiating conversation but didn t feel that she reciprocated the effort  so i let it be  after she ended the friendship relationship  she told me that she tried to kill herself because of me a few month back and listed all the reason it came to this  she asked me not to tell her family and that she wa doing better now  but that them knowing would rid her of the only support network she ha    i cut contact and i don t plan on reopening it  i wa devastated  then angry  by now i am concerned  a lot of the thing she said  aren t true  at least not completely  i got the feeling  that she painted the world in a way darker light than it actually wa  and i am kinda sure  that i am not actually the reason she did this  it could be  that i am trying to make this palatable to myself  but i really believe that my action   or lack thereof   shouldn t be enough to push someone over the edge  especially when she say she did all these thing for me  changed for me  but never actually communicated with me about that  if i am not the deciding factor though  it mean that it could happen again   i am facing the dilemma now  that i don t know if her concern is true  i don t know if her family would abandon her for the attempt  i don t know why they would  but i am also not an expert on their dynamic  so it could be true or it could be her making the world bleaker than it is    she said she s doing better but she also said that she isn t going to therapy and isn t planning on doing so  i am worried that other trigger might lead to her doing it again and no one in her close proximity knowing to watch out for it  on the other hand i don t want to actually make everything worse for her   i have her sister s number so i could talk with her  i just wanted to know if this is a real thing   loving and supporting family pulling back that support because of a suicide attempt  i feel thoroughly out of my debth ,depression

312,i once fell in love with a french boy from australia  we were together everyday for   month  those were the best month of my life  he wa amazing  fun  spontaneous  and so handsome  we separated when we both went home for christmas  i remember replaying our song on my way back and cry my eye out on the plane  it wa really difficult  after a few month we grew apart and split  it wa hard watching his interest in me fade away a each day went by   basically i became super depressed for over   year after that and almost killed myself  i wa smoking a pack a day  gross i know  but only   thing helped me get to a better place now where i can finally say im happy  i really wanted to share what worked for me because maybe it could save someone life   i call then my happy pill       htp    ltyrosine    egcg  essential for serotonin conversion that a lot of people are deficient     magnesium   i started off taking only  htp and then added ltyrosine to my daily cocktail of pill   htp serotonin and ltyrosine  dopamine     after researching more about it i read that egcg  green tea extract is excellent source  is required for serotonin conversion  so i added that to the cocktail and man it made such a difference omg  color literally seem more vibrant and i can actually feel joy now    ever since im taking these i feel motivated af and no longer depressed although i do have occasional low mood where i will just double up   i recommend it to anyone who want to cure depression naturally because maybe like me youre just deficient in dopamine and serotonin  building block    the one i use is from amazon it got them all in   pill plus all the cofactor  save me from buying them all separately  so far this is the only one found with all of them  they stay with me everywhere i go when the blue try to come back i just make it go away with my happy pill    http   www amazon com dp b b rxh  z ref cm sw r awdo a  d   p pk     v b     you can also buy them separately just make sure you get  htp  ltyrosine  egcg  and magnesium  i only got result when i took them all combined   would love to hear if it help anyone   please know that you are not alone and there is a way out of this i promise ,depression

344,six month ago my depression went away on a friday  i wa    and never exactly knew that i wa chemically depressed until i experienced normal  i couldnt believe how light i felt  nothing felt wrong a it always had done before  everything had seemed insurmountable forever  i recall thinking it wa strange that i had no concept of what happiness meant   and it wasnt only the depression and anxiety   at the same time the muscle tension dysphonia affecting my voice fully resolved along with the cognitive impairment  all symptom have since intermittently appeared and disappeared together   always together at the exact same time    i didnt know i had either of these issue until i experienced the difference  feeling depth in my voice without the gravelly quality and grating discomfort  being able to do math and remember phone number  thinking visually and translating idea into speech without making mistake or stuttering    im seeing a psychiatrist next month and hopefully will try an snri   wellbutrin  however im concerned that these will not resolve the cognitive issue which are my main concern  until recently i believed it must be some type of fibromyalgia   neuroloinflammatory condition causing the slowed thinking  but after reading into the cognitive effect of anxiety and depression  it seems likely theyre the underlying cause   doe anyone have any recommendation for treatment option  i wa meditating and exercising daily for three year leading up to the breakthrough and had actually stopped both several week beforehand  which is concerning because i dont know what else i can try beyond treating the depression    all reply are appreciated ,depression
345,i could really use some advice right now   so      is coming up and i ll soon be off my parent insurance plan  and the fact of the matter is  i m not ready        i still don t have my license  i still don t have a great social life  and i m still stuck at the same minimum wage job i had back in           i m just not in a good position and idk what to do in the new year to make thing even a little better    i tried applying to multiple job over the year but none would give me the time of day after the interview  however another issue with finding employment wa not really having any  real  skill  i wa force to dropout of community college cause thing just got too expensive to keep attending  and even then  i really only went there cause my parent said it would be good to have a degree for future employment   i went for major in fine art if that s worth anything  but i really just came out of it with no real skill to talk about      what s worse is that can t really branch out to many place cause i don t have a license to go anywhere   i only have the job i have since it s in walking distance   combine that with not having a higher education then high school graduate and thing don t really look very uplifting      a for social life i m very introverted and struggle talking to people  i try to put my best foot forward to talk to people  but thing do really last past the initial interaction        the only people in my life are my family of   and a few friend i made online but never met in person    and what s sad is that they ve been mostly busy with their own responsibility and stuff so i m usually alone  i thought i d be use to this loneliness by now  but it still always find a way to really get to me      my mental state  amp  depression ha increased over the year and it s not getting any better  i tried getting prescribed to anti depressant but i got in a bit of a heated argument with my father about it   i prefer not talk about it   i thought about therapy  but past experience made me not trust them  tho i know i probably need one   is better help a good option    for all my life i had dream of becoming an animator making their own series to inspire people and that s really what s keeping to going at this point  but i made so little progress on achieving that goal    i couldn t go to the art school i wanted since it wa too expensive and my father didn t want to pay for it out of pocket  and the fine art class i took at community college really discouraged me due to my professor s pretty high standard   and work  class  and my own depression getting in the way really didn t leave me in a good state to practice on my own time  it took dropping out to free up a slot to do so  but by that point i m basically in my current position now of next to no progress      i ve been practicing the past few month and i m really struggling to do this on my own with not real time feedback from an instructor  i recently found a discord that could help  but it s not enough  i wanted to try out skillshare  but that s money and i don t make enough that wouldn t hurt my profit      mentally  the thought of succeeding at this is the only thing that s keeping me going and if i lost that i ll probably just k ll myself cause i just can t take anymore disappointment in my life      if anyone ha any advice that can turn thing around      i m all ear   ,depression

361,a little over three month ago my partner ended thing with me completely out of the blue after two year together and two month after buying a house together  we lived together for over a year before we got our house  at the beginning of this year my mental health declined after getting hyperthyroidism after covid  my antidepressant stopped working and i had to start trying others which made me very emotional  i wa cry very often but wa constantly doing work in the relationship to be a good partner despite my anxiety and depression  at first my partner wa supportive and made me feel like he would help me through this  we had plan to marry and adopt child together  later on my partner would make me feel very uncomfortable while going through this and i felt like a huge emotional burden  he would ask for space so i would stay with my parent for day at a time to try to make sure he stayed happy  he would assure me during this time that we could get through anything together and he would never leave me  i continued to worry about being a burden so i would still do all of the cooking and cleaning and tried to maintain a job a an rn while onboarding with different antidepressant  i could feel him drifting and it terrified me  i went to therapy and psych appointment  did yoga  started journaling  bible study  anything to try to improve my condition  all the while i wa so worried that i would take too long to get better and he would run out of patience  unfortunately my fear were justified and one day while he wa out of town he called and broke up with me in the middle of me battling suicidal depression  obviously this made thing much worse  my whole life changed after a quick phone call  we sold the house and he stopped talking to me  i wa the closest ive ever been to ending my life after he broke up with me  he told me he thought i would never get better and the rest of my life would be trying one pill after another with no success  the time we have talked after he broke up with me were devastating  he would hang up on me  tell me he didnt have time for me because he wanted to go out with friend  ignore me completely  this is completely different from any way he treated me before  like a totally different person entered his body  then my    year old dog and best friend passed away a month later and he didnt even send a text to say he wa sorry for my loss  i even started self harming  ive been trying to pick up the piece for over three month  i landed a new job that i love  i moved into a rental house with a close friend  am spending time with friend and family but nothing help  nothing stop the intrusive thought of him and our relationship and how perfect i felt we were together  i have panic attack daily and cry myself go sleep every night  i have lost    pound and i am already small  my mind is completely overtaken by him and the anxious attachment that remains  i feel like my mind is on fire all day every day and i need help  i really need help getting through this  i miss him so much and our life together  even after all that he done to me i crave our old life together and the way he made me feel  when will i stop grieving  or just feel a little okay  im terrified im stuck like this forever  i have never experienced so much pain and i am no stranger to loss but nothing compare to this,depression

366,i ve been depressed for a few year now and did a lot of research on thing you can do to improve  and even managed to reach out to therapist and a few other people who helped me greatly  but i wa never really able to start doing anything significant to make a change in my life  because it s just way too difficult and i simply refuse doing it   i d prefer to just sit back in my comfort zone  feel sad and occasionally complain about how bad my life is  but couldn t manage to bring myself to really be willing to do the necessary and difficult thing   i realise the flaw in it  and that s partially why i m making this post  i genuinely want to change and improve  but deep down i m just like  no  screw this  whenever something is even remotely outside of my comfort zone   i tried the baby step approach  where you do something very tiny every day and eventually build up from there  but it would only help me to a certain point  after which i will just refuse continuing and just quit the whole thing   i spoke to a good few therapist but they weren t really able to tell me anything that would cause me to get up and do something  all they could do is point out what exactly is going on and why i m acting this way  but even despite knowing that i behave like a spoiled brat  i simply don t care   i m aware eventually the day will come when i can no longer keep this up  and i get thrown into the real world and have to start doing the necessary thing despite really not wanting to  but i seriously don t want to wait until that happens  i d much rather gain the discipline to do these thing now while it s not too late  but i have no idea what else i m supposed to try at this point ,depression

414,nobody will probably read this but life is not good for me right now  it hasn t been good for quite awhile  i ve  been suffering with depression and social anxiety since i wa about    year old  i m    now and life ha not been kind through the year  sometimes i just want to end it all but something inside me tell me thing will get better but i just wish i knew when it would  my credit score suck because i have financial problem  i feel like a fucking loser with wasted talent and not a pot to piss in  can t even get a new cellphone because i m always broke and they won t give me one because of my credit  i know material item aren t the source for happiness but i need to find happiness wherever i can or else i ll go insane  don t even have any friend  my immediate family is tiny and they don t give a shit about me  my dog of    year is currently dying and i have to deal with his euthanasia tomorrow  i could get therapy but i feel like it would be a waste of time because it never ever worked in the past  i ve lost all motivation to want to change  i don t care about romance either because i m too much baggage and untrusting of people intention because of all the disappointment i ve experienced in my life  i love to write poetry and story but even that is becoming a chore  the environment i live in is toxic but i m trapped  i just feel    heavy    there s too much on top of me and i can t breath  i don t want to breath  i don t want to exist until i can finally feel good  i m tired of being everyone s rock    i m tired of pretending i m okay    i m tired of trying and trying to become stable  financially  socially  mentally  physically  i ignore all my debt because fuck them  i m just    tired  i appreciate it if you have read this far  thank you   ,depression
415,i wa part of a friend group that cut me off because of my depression  more specifically cause i asked for support and they took great offense the mere notion of that somehow despite the fact that they all either deal with depression themselves or have family who do  i m only in contact with one of these friend still and they ve been reluctant to vouche for me with the other  i started writing a suicide note for them to read but they ve all blocked me so the only way i can get it to them is through this friend   now i ll say that one of the people in this group is my ex and the note wa mostly meant for her to read and while it started a a suicide note it turned into more of just everything i want to say to  no vitriol or anything just a look into how i feel especially pertaining to how they had treated me  i even wrote it around flower symbolism which is something my ex wa very into    i think just by sending this note along it could help me to move on  it could give me some amount of closure that they have refused me over and over  the one problem with that is my friend might just refuse to send the note which would suck a lot for me a i d once again be denied that closure   so what do yall think  should i send it and hope for the best  or should i just swallow my feeling and assume they ll never be satiated ,depression

424,my brother is turning    in february and ha no friend  no job  is lazy  hate going out etc  growing up people considered him to be kind of a weird kid or something cuz my mom had to take him to a child psychiatrist since everyone around u would notice that he wa always in his own little world and whenever someone would try to bring him out even just for a moment he would make a fuss and degrade people  he ha always been kind of fidgety too and everytime we were in the car together my parent had to tell him to stop moving because he wa shaking the car  the psychiatrist said that he wa just a normal kid but just ha a higher active imagination than others  he ha always been good with his study so you could say that he is more book smart than people smart  so if he book smart then why hasnt he thought about his future or try to do something with his unique memory  him and i would always butt head growing up too  we are basically opposite in a sense  and im not going to lie if he ever degraded me i would i always try to do it back    fold  but now that we are pretty much grown up im realizing how much i probably impacted him because now he doesnt want to do anything with his life  his routine now is always sleep game eat and taking a shit  he hasnt had a job in two year and only doe small favor for my mom like getting her a cup of water or sumn  the reason he even had a job wa because my mom made him work with her  he doesnt clean the house  cook do laundry  nothing  ever since he got laid off cuz of covid his brain is only stuck on video game  he weird but he still my brother  he grown to be kind of loving now and again were opposite  he try to hug me but i hate hug so i push him away especially cuz he smell half the time  idk what to do he doesnt want to look for help and expects u to do everything for him  i tried looking for job that dont involve interacting with people a much but he just too scared to experience the world in a sense ,depression

432,ok so i feel a lot le depressed these day despite being far lonelier and having far more negative experience and i believe this is what make it a lot more bearable   warning  do not use it on emotion you want to feel  if you want to feel good a much a possible do not use it on those   i believe that emotion are just thought that we do not understand enough to put into word  they have to let themselves be known  somehow   i think there are only   way you can feel an emotion le intensively  doing what the emotion is trying to make you do or by trying to describe it a greatly a you can  i think that when an emotion is intense enough and it start changing your thought it s your brain trying to force you to do this at smaller scale already on it own   if you feel like a failure  like you re not smart enough  good enough  like you cannot change anything or even if you feel like you do not know why you feel the way you feel  try to keep asking yourself why you feel that way  make sure that you do not get side tracked into rationalising it  keep saying  because i feel like it is  not  because it s true   if you catch yourself saying  because it s true  then ask  why do i feel like it s true  and continue   this is me trying it out    i feel like a failure    why    because i feel like i m worse than others    why    because i feel like thing that make me worse than others are bad    why    because i feel like they are giving me a disadvantage    why    because i feel like they are not a optimal    why    because i feel like i could have a better life if they were different    why    because i feel like the life of people who are different are better    why    because i feel like the stuff that happens to them is better    why    because i feel like it would make me le miserable    why    because i feel like that s what i want    why    because i feel like i need it to thrive    why    because i feel like just surviving is not enough    why    because i feel like it would not be a fulfilling    why    because i feel like then i would feel le alive    why    because i feel like that would make surviving not really worth it    why    because i feel like if it isn t worth it then what s the point    why    because i feel like if there is no point then why survive          now think about any emotion  is there any that wouldn t make you ask the same question eventually  they are fundamentally the same  you feel emotion because you need to somehow be aware of everything you know you need to do to increase your chance of survival even if you cannot describe it with word   what i did with  why   is pretty much lowering the intensity of how much i m feeling an emotion by increasing the intensity of how much i m thinking about it   i know it sound counterproductive at the first glance  you probably think you re thinking a lot about your emotion already  you don t want to think about them more  i am not denying that the amount of time you spend thinking about your depression is making you feel insane  what i m trying to say is that you should try to spend the time that you spend thinking about it a time that you think about it  more deeply    you can then use the same approach to the thought a well  just change  why do i feel like this  to  why do i think this is true   warning again     if you do this with every thought you ll eventually start thinking so deeply you ll start asking philosphical question which could possibly lead to you feeling depressed again  only use it to battle thought you do not want to be thinking   i think this is what people mean when they say it s all about the perspective and how you look at it is what make the difference  when i wa asking the question why  i wa looking at different perspective  a you can see the deeper you go the more the difference between different thing disappears   so why do you feel depressed and think depressive thought   why ,depression

story without missing detail that may seem trivial but yet  maybe  important  i am french and pretty good at english but there may be some writing error  but i will try to make it quick  amp  effective    i will just explain a bit about me and the problem before diving into the situation   so  i m     male  and for all my life i ve never been lucky on the sentimental point  never really had a girlfriend  had sex a couple time but there wa never really love that made it happen  happened on holiday  some party  wa great but it never really made me feel so proud because in fact i don t really care about sex  yeah it s cool  but it s not really what i am looking for  if i am being honest i ve always been told i wa a really good looking guy   ft   gray blue eye  pretty skinny but started working out  few month ago  to take better care of me and i am actually the best version of myself i have ever been  i am really happy about what i see in the mirror but       of the time i see myself in a picture  i think i look ugly af  but anyway  i know girl are attrayed by me   please trust me i am not venting and claiming i am  sooo hot  no one can stop me from gettint any girl  blah blah blah that s not true  thing is i ve always struggled to get the girl i wanted  like my fu       brain want me to suffer  from the time i could be able to love someone to this very moment  i always be unlucky  love someone who don t love me  she prefers my best friend  or right person wrong time  i am too stupid to see she love me etc   always  from my childhood to my  around      i am    now   i never really took good care of me and seeing tho old photo  i kind of understand why i didn t really attracted the woman i wanted  but i believe i am actually becoming a grown responsible men and i am starting to become someone that the one i wanted to become at    would have dreamed of beeing  looooooong way ahead  but i m sure i am on the right path     but  i ve had a normal life till i wa around    i have a bit older brother who is my very best friend  my parent split up  not married  i didn t really feel sad  they are both really loving person  still on good term  they both love me deeply and i really love them too  we ve never been really rich  my mother work in a bank  in an office  like  she order furniture for some of the different agency of the bank in paris etc and some other thing   and my father work in restauration  i mean he runned for year restaurant in paris     at a time   my mother is a really kind person  tell me she love me a lot and i love her even more  and my father never talk about his feeling  is a bit distant but i know him wlel on the sentimental point because i am like him  my mom told it to me many time haha  i don t really know about his life  he s been to prison when he wa young  for like   month  and i don t know why  i know like     about his childhood  i am not joking  but i am his only son and i know he love me even tho he only said it once   i will explain really really soon   when they got separated i went to live with my mother  my father wa one of the   boss of a  kinda  famous restaurant on the champ elyses  and he wa almost always at work  that is one of the reason the separated  so it made sense i went with her  a few week after she got with my  soon to be  step father  he wasn t really nice to me and my brother  we didn t like him  i can t talk too much about his job but it wa a hard job  where he lost a few of his coworkers during some attack   reaaaaaly rare but it happened  and he is what we call a  narcissic pervert   this is the french translation  so whatever bad happens  it s my fault and my brother s  i wa living in paris having a great great life so when she got with him  we had to move and went to another city close to paris and my father got a smaller appartment in paris  while still working his as  i hated the new place  but could stay in the same school i wa for   more year before we moved again when they found another appartment in another city for   year  it wa good  made some really good friend  and since i wa away from my now really lonely father and only saw him once every   week for   day  he became an alcoholic  but i didn t know  every   week we would go away from paris in a pretty nice property with   big house that belonged to my aunt s husband who is a lawyer  and he could get the  nd house for whatever reason i didn t know at the time  nothing big about this situation   wa great  i am now around    my mother and step father are having a baby  my little sister who i deeply love i am about to go to  th class of what we call college  and we had to move again cause my mother and step father found a house in a place i kinda hated  first year of college wa really shit   nd year a bit better but the situation at my house wa becoming really shit because of my step father wa almost violent with my mom and sister and wa violent with my brother and sometimes  me  and then  my big bro  who wa at the time trying to find himself and doing all kind of wrong  went for a robbery with a friend of his  got caugh and had to leave the house to be with another family by decision of justice for   year  i wa alone at home with my poor and sad mom who now kinda hated this man  and i wa really really sad  lost  no friend i really loved  and then at  rd year of our college  a new guy appeared  my new best friend  we became closse really soon but he  at the time wa a pretty toxic guy and i followed cause i wanted to see something different  and at    yo  we started smoking weed  a lot  began to skip college a lot  i wa becoming cooler  became popular girl liked me but like i said earlier  not lucky with it and or too high scared to make a move  drug alcohol were my escape  but seeing how my father wa becoming because of alcohol made me step away from it a bit  since he often gave me some money  i spend it all on drug  situation at home became really really fucking shit  stepfather started to lay his hand on me  my mom  sometime s my sister  and he once went too far and pushed my mother off the stair but luckily nothing dramatic happened to her  she couldn t call the cop because he would lose his job since it is government related  and they separated   and my best friend had to go back where his mother lived because we had made too many bad thing drug related and his father wa tired to pick him up at the police station  i wa alone again with a depressed mother  and a sister cry everyday not understanding what wa happening to u  lonely a fuck  big bro came back but had to move to my father s appartment to start working in restaurant cause my father could help him find a job easily  but had to retire because of his health due to alcohol long thing to explain but my father had a really special way to raise me  in fact he don t know how to do that  when i went to him every two week and wa in paris  he just showed me thing in the appartment  gave me money and  like  do a you please  take metro and go wherever you want  even when i wa like        when he found out i wa smoking at     he wa really mad for a week  then bought me a    pack of marlboro light  because he wa too scared i would not come again since he wa mad  so he always do whatever he can to make me go to see him    amp  x   b   but now i am     entering  lyce    so upper aged high school  and couldnt go to the one in my city cause i skipped too many day at college so they of course would let me live life so easily  could only last   month  wa in complete depression  got beat up  phone stolen twice  no friend  no one to look up to me  mother sad  having a bit of trouble to pay for everything since she now have to pay for everything  and concentrating on my little sister  completely agreed with that  and i wa thinking about killing myslef  after only   week i used to leave home telling my mother i wa going to school but wa too afraid to go  so i went on the street almost everyday a  am and coming back home at  pm acting like i wa there  and  still smoking too much  i used to be unbeatable  no one in that city could outsmoke me  they would jus throw up while i would be rolling another one and i wa kinda famous for that  but since my life wa a nightmare  i started being more and more  hit  by weed a soon i wasn t able to smoke a single puff without going  white  and  nauseaous  like it wa my first time  and i almost  i believe they would have stabbed me  got killed cause a guy in college stabbed a guy i hated and then left forever  of course   and while in hospital  stabbed guy i hate described the guy who did  and corresponded to me  on many point  but of course i didn t do it    guy older than me took me apart during lunch break  one of them went to punch me first and a they usually always do because lot of young people like smoke weed in this spot  police car show up  they start running and i did too  don t know why  i wa in shock  never came back  came back home told mom i had to leave and went to live at my father appartment in paris the same day  i wa devastated because my mom cried a lot  not understaning and me unable to explain  and i wa feeling deeply empty    living with him wa hard because he wa getting deep into alcohol and i wasn t able to smoke weed anymore like i said because i would get white and sick instantly without me knowing why  while my brain wanted it  father stopped working a few year ago  brother left france for australia for   year  i started doing a music school but everytime i a week  at least   stop  i used to have these kind of panic attack where i would  only  be nauseous like fucking hell  could move during these and wa horrified at the idea of throwing up  so i would also qui the music school and be lonely a fuck because i don t know anyone in paris since i left when i wa    only   friend here and he is still my best one now but he wa in school  and my father wa getting really sick  really really sick  and it lasted   year i believe  i wa with him everyday  calling     every week  thank you france it is free  and these guy would just get him out and putting him in a taxi and ring the doorbell  and i had to carry my father   floor and he wasn t even heavy  he couldn t eat and not throw up    min after  he had to keep drinking again and again or he would die of delirium tremens  and since he became too skinny  to week   i wa the one who had to go to the store  getting litter and litter of wine  and  a lot of time when he couldn t get up  i had to pour him drink and help him drink  how fcked up that wa  but strangely  of course i wa sad  but i began feeling remorse because i expected to feel even worst  but i didn t and it felt weird  i felt like a complete piece of shit for not being extreme sad  and began thinking i wa unable to feel thing  course i wa able to  but i just closed myself  and my brother came back and we did what we could to get him to rehab  he went  wa clean for   month and then came back to his old way  me  still alone a fuck  almost no friend  kinda forgot how to interact with people  dreaming of having a girlfriend  finally stopped weed drug even tho i would have prefered to keep doing them  i decide it is time to find a job  since i am now     i tell my brother to ask his bos to make me work at the brasserie he work at   but it would be difficult because these panic attack get really difficult for me to endure and i stard thinking about killing myself  but i know i am too scared for that  i ask mom to get me appointment to a psycologist  and start therapy  it doesn t work that much and i don t really believe in this  he give me med that make me feel like a fucking vegetable laying on the ground  i hate it  i became hyppocondriac  thought i had cancer and stuff  of course no  and i tell him about a symptom that i have and he give me a med for it and miraculously it help my major panic attack thing  so i can work  started working a     father left the appartment to go to the big house away from paris i told you about earlier  rent too high for me and my brother so we get the upstairs one bit cheaper and bit smaller  but i am still so lonely  and seems like i want to stay that way  work is too hard for me  father isn t felling good and is having same problem  i left about   month after  took care of my father again for   year  he finally got up and never drank again to this day but what i went thru that last year will always be engraved in my mind  one night  i hear a loud boom  open my room s door and see him on the ground trying to get up  i wa paralysed by fear again but managed to keep it together  help him go to toilet and had to stay close to help him get up  put him in bed  had to bring him a glass of wine from one of the    now empty    liter pack of white wine  and he then asked me if i loved him  he hadn t talk for   week and this wa the only thing he said  i said yes  scared  lost  he then said  i love you too my son  and i started cry  i felt like it wa his final word and i would see him dead by morning  in his bed i don t know how  i went to bed  and found sleep in an instant  i believe a just blacked out due to trauma  next morning he wasn t here  he called my aunt who wa in the house in front and she got him to hospital and he went for his last rehab and he is clean since that moment i manage to go back to my same job but only last   more month  too hard for me  fat forwad for the next year  nothing happens  nothing  football soccer  world cup      semi final  an old colleague of mine call and tell me he took his own restaurant  and asks me to go to help him cause it s his first day and almost no barman waiter showed up  i accepted cause i felt useless and wa waiting for a sign for a year there it wa  but that colleague is a pretty weird bos  stayed   year in that restaurant  shitty place  lot of problem  really toxic atmosphere  shitty life  i leave  my old best friend from college i started smoking weed with moved with me in the appartment cause my brother went back to australia for a year  cohabitation isn t so good but it s ok  i find another restaurant  with people i once again know pretty well  it  s shit but i start to move my fkn as to get my shit together cause i want a good life  i still smoke cigarette  too much  think too much about stoping  always want to leave work before even coming in  went to tokyo for   week with my friend and then  covid  lockdown wa so fkn great for me  always loved music and made a lot of it  i m pretty good at it  played warzone everyday with old friend  but couldn t stop smoking  lockdown lasted   month  got back to work  lasted   more monts i think and then i stopped smoking  i had enough of being a lazy piece of shit  never doing what he say  lonely  i had enough  i stopped smoking  and it changed my life  the way i do thing  hard to explain but the motto i developped for it is basically the nike one   just do it just fucking to it for god s sake  move your as  just do something  i started getting rid f all the bullshit in my life and started working on being a man  asked my highest father friend for a job in one of his restaurant   this man is really really well established in paris  i won t say name but you definitely know at least one of his restauraurants in paris  no joke   he say yes  and i start working  focus on becoming a man  i work   day  lockdown again       fuuuuuuuck my life  i wa happy i found a good job that pay pretty well compared to the others i did  but anyway  it lasted   month  had to lost lot of stuff to pay rent  worked out hard and felt great  came back to work and started hanging with people  good people  they helped me get rid of that loneliness without trying  started changing  becoming better and better  in my mind and in my heart  i am a really kind person  never got in a fight  always love to please people  used to be really introvert because of what happened  i am now an  almost  extravert person  always smiling  finding joy in making people feel good  i love it  really  because i don t want the few people i know hang out to not like being around me  i want to be a source of smile  for people to love my company  but      i ve been away from almost of kind human interaction for like   year  it seems like i m lying   i m not  i don t fucking know what to talk about when i m with them  but i believe in am really intelligent in some way  so i manage to hide that and it s okay  they are pulling me up and i do the same  i even manage to stop the med to stop my panic attack  i feel good  really  arrived at this job on the   th of may       wa    yo  everything is incredible until june        my birthday  i always hate my birthday because i  always spent them alone  always  since i wa     i an remember new year      to       i wa with my step father who came to take care of my sister while my mother wa on vacation  he  i admit  in a kind way  pushed me to go with a group of people i kew pretty well to celebrate the new year  i went to them  no more room for me in the car  i had to let them go  no room for me  so i just walked in that city i hate    celsius  for hour waiting for the new year to pas so i can come home around   am and he don t get mad at me for not going  and all this kind of loneliness came back on june       i wa working  finished early but all my friend do the same job and they can t come to me  i start feeling alone like i used to  realising that even tho a lot of good thing changed  i m still so lonely  i dinda desperately want a girlfriend  someone to take care of  someone i can show how magnificent my love can be  someone i can talk with for hour and hour  but i kept it together    and  there we are  on the end of july i felt a bit better  still lonely but it s ok  i can live with it  i m just     plenty of time  there are almost always male waiter who come to work at our place  this time  a girl came to present herslef  so beautiful  and also provocative  but being honest  at first  i thought she wa kind of a  slut   the word is too hard for what i tought but anyway  all the crew is pretty young  even the bos  no one is over     the new girl  she is     i m     the age gap is pretty big to me  and i believe a the moment that she isn t that interesting and just want to be seen and act provocative  so i don t really think about trying to have something with her  and like i said  i don t that that much about sex  but daaaang she beautiful   and  it s sad but a reality  colleague start to wanna bang since she make a lot of sex joke etc  they all do the same  trying to fuck with her  but i wasn t trying  but couldn t help but admire how beautiful she is  and one night  that girl who always seemend not to care about how my colleague kept doing more and more thing to her  like un buttoning her bra in the middle of the terrasse  how fucked up can you be to do this  she always laughed at this  but talking to her about that because i believed it wasn t acceptable  i realised she wa more than just a girl who act like a slut  she is actually very smart  really  ha a pretty dark humor like me  study international marketing  etc and come to work when she is on holiday et came back on the weekend even when she got back to study  like  always doing something  i wa impressed  we started talking for a bit  and i wa the only one she talked with  about other thing than the bullshit most people did talk about with her  we talked about more profound thing  she understood i wasn t tryind to fuck and she kinda liked it i guess  day passed  i kinda start to fall il love  even tho she is not the type of girl who would be happy with me  too different lifestyle  she ha a full life  go to vacacion with    friend  i don t even have   i would like to go somewhere with   maybe i exagerated  i m just always working  not a lot of friend  nothing that interesting about my life really  except i could talk for hour with anyone about various thing  religion  what you think abt space etc  idea  but i sometimes struggle to talk with her because we are pretty different  but still she really appreciate me and i do to  and day go by  we work together everyday  and everytime i go home  i live alone now since the start of the  nd lockdown   i feel more and more alone  sad that i don t have girlfriend  i have a few good friend now  but still i am sad but i can live with it  i go to a small party we organised for the last day at work of a colleague  in another place than the one we work at  at we  at night  decide to go to our place  and she is there working  i wa a bit drunk  just a bit  i saw her  and thought   fuck  fuck  fuck  i  think love her  and realised once again that my brain wanted to suffer    we sat  she wa still working with other table  and the mood of the night wa  for the vast majority of them  to get fkn drunk  i m not into that since i ve saw where it lead you  so i decided to leave  felt lonely again because of that  i say goodbye to them  and she wa outside smoking a cigarette  and asks me why i am leaving  i tell her it s complicated  she saw in my face i wa sad and couldn t figure why since the mood inside wa really cool  and the look she gave me  the smile  the way she looked at me and just kept asking again and again and again begging me to say what s wrong  i fell in love at that exact moment  because no one  in all my fucking life  no woman so beautiful  and so secretly interesting  never cared about me that way  girl like her when i wa younger would just mock me  not even look at me  but her  she is showing me sign that she care about what i think and it fucked me up because deep inside  i could feel that nothing would be possible between u  i just feel it  she is onto someone here i am not that person  and that i would just get hurt and i don t really need that  i manage to go without telling her exactly but tell her i d be happy to talk to her about this another day  the next day is my last day before my   day off  and we work together  i barely slept because of this but i really don t feel like it s irreversible  it s ok  but i m tired and can t run everywhere  since she ha only been here for   month  she isn t really really good at the job but she made progress in   month that i never saw before  and she took care of all my fucking table for me  almost running to every table where she could take empty glass  tried her best to sell expensive thing to client for me to earn more money  and it drove me nut  how  why  i never felt that way  bu i remember it felt fucking great  i felt loved even tho it wasn t really the case  our shift ended   it s august  it s warm  it s   am  we seat down at the terrasse  her  my director who is also a good friend and kinda like a big brother to me  really friendly and try do make me smile whenever he can  and  i admit  fucking good looking  i said earlier i believe i am good looking  really  he s a bit older and even more good looking  and her  and my sixth sense  who is right       of time  tell me she would be more interested in him than me  but fuck it  i felt love in a way i never did in my life  we drank a bit  i wa a bit high but it s ok  i come home on electric bicycle   am  all the light in paris are off  it s warm  the is starting go  up  i stop at red light in front of the grand palais on champ elyses  and see the golden roof of the monument de invalides getting brightenned up by the coming sun  sky is purple orange  no light except this golden roof and the slowly brightening sky and i felt i wa living a privilieged moment  felt surreal  came home  kinda happy  still a bit lonely  went to sleep at      am  woke up at  am  never felt so bad in all my life  i had that severes anxiety in me  and i could stop thinking about her  like really  i wa really  awefully bad  i felt like i lived in black and white  couldn t feel anything except big sadness and wa scared  first day off  like this  scared af abt what wa happening  wa really a hard  lonely day   nd day off wa worse  thougth i wa going to kill myself because i really really had to stop this  i can t understant shit about what is going on and i feel this strange and urgent need to fell  normal  again before i am forced to kill myself to stop me for feeling this undescriptible way  call a psycologist  gave me med  felt worst  went to work the next day  i called them to warn them about the fact i wa extremely down  they understood  came anyway  saw her  had a panic attack  went outside  and she came to sit right next to me to finally talk about why i left  i ve basically told her about averything i said here  told her how i see those guy trying to fuck her  my vision of the reality  kida told her about my feeling for her without telling it but i know she already know  she cried  it fucked me up  she started talking about her problem  with her father etc   and even tho i think u should have felt better after that  i felt worse  even worse  got to work the next day so i m sure i don t kill myself if i stay home  she finished work when i arrives  so i think  good  i will be a bit more in peace  and she sat at the terrasse in front with other colleague for a couple drink  i couldn t handle seeing her  i don t know how to explain  i left  called my mom for help  told her what wa happening  but she saw i wa outside  cry  down bad  and she came to see me  not understanding it s fucking me up even more  all my colleague came to see me  i felt like shit for them all to see me like this  we then went to a bar close to where we were  she wa gone cause she worked early next morning  worst night of my entire life  the ambiance wa so fucking toxic everyone wa talking shit about everyone we knew   almost everyone did  these fucker started screaming at the terrasse at girl  ordering many bottle  and then  they started talking about her  abt how she is hot and they would love to fuck her  and many other horrible thing that made me feel even worst  one of them call her  telling her to come where we wa  and she came  i couldn t handle seeing her and i left  didn t go back for   week  taking med to feel better and it worked bit  i wa able to work  i told her that i had feeling for her but i know she don t love me like that so i skipped the subject pretty fast but i wanted to make sure she know  day go by  i learn something happened between her and the director  it fuck me up so much but in fact  i knew it  me and her didn t talk by message  but we started doing so in october  when i came back to work after that   week off  i started working out like crazy  felt good  it saved my life  really  i tought that her finally knowing i love her  she would take distance with me  she didn t she kept being so nice  i could handle it  she would start sending picture  message on ig telling me abt her day at work or university  i fucking loved that  i thought i finally went past that  i wa finally over it  since i wa taking better care of me  i starded having some beautiful girl giving me number  but in fact  it s her i kept having on my mind  could even think any girl wa beautiful  it s just her  it went like this for a month before i started living my life normally again  a so gorgeous woman gave me her number  a woman like this  never ever got interested in me  she gave me her number and i saw my way out  a way to finally get over her  but she answered for a day she wa happy i texted  and then never answered before i could even be able to say something that would cause this reaction  i got a bit sad  she saw it  asked me what wa wrong without letting get away without telling her  and here  again   there is exactly what i said  i need you to tell me what is wrong with me  there is something  something no one ever fucking tell me  that get me away from getting what i need  you know  i thought my feeling for you were gone and that i would finally be able to move on  this girl gave me her number  she wa really good looking  i took it  and she never texted back before i could even provoke that kind of reaction  why telling me i am an awesome guy  kind  good looking but still manage to not even try to give me a chance  there ha to be something you bitch don t want to tell me so i don t get sad  i don t give a single fuck of being hurt  i hardly can feel worse  so why do you bitch do that    i said it in a funny way  let me remind you we joke a lot me and her  always  and he she just proceeded to tell me how handsome  good looking  funny i wa  but i wa still seeing that it didn t meant she wanted to do something with me  and i still to this day  don t have my answer  we kept talking everyday  a lot by private message on ig  sending funny meme  and i came to a point when i wasn t thinking all day about her  able to live my life normally  i wa happy with our relation  it s cool if it stay like that  but deep down i know i love her and can t get past that  and you know  when i felt horrible  realised that the person i wa  the guy who wa too nice and stupid  in fact it savec my life  because i thought that being too nice would just bring me people who would take thing from me and take advantage of  but i am not stupid and can easily see when people try  and being that cool  nice  patient  i realised that i wasn t a lonely a i kept thinking  because i ve seen colleague down low  and no one gave a fuck because they weren t acting a nice people  when they wa me this bad  so down  so esperated  they all  everyone  came to me and tried their fucking best to help me feel good  and i realisedthe importance of being  nice to others and it saved my life  i realised that pretty recently  changed the way i see life in what i thought wa a good way  but  recently  she started talking le and le  but she is now the only one person i am so close to  since i did my best to provide the best thing to my friend  helped some of them to get that one girl they love  all of them are now with their girl  i am not mad at them  i understand  i want my people to be happy  but right now  guy  i am down    she don t talk like she used to anymore  seem a bit more distant  a don t get why    she stopped working for   month and a half  cause she ha exam and need to take a bit of rest  but we kept talking a lot i it wa ok to me  i tell myself that maybe she just got a bit bored of me  i don t know  i can undersand i m not incredibly interesting  but she came to see u all at work   day ago and she wa ultra nice and funny to me just like she used to be  so i thought that i wa just overthinking  and this is my major problem in life  i can t stop overthinking  we had a great night  drank a bit with her and the director she had affair with  even tho he told me he knew it wa really bad and he shouldn t have done that  had a great night really  she then went outside cause she got mad at one of the guy who clean the restaurant at night because he kept talking again again gain abt bullshit  i went outside and she told me she would really really love to see my cat  bengal cat  so fkn beautiful  and wanted u to go eat something really soon and to see my bengal cat  so i wa really happy about that  she genuinely wa looking forward to see me again and she is the one who proposed to hang out and see my cat so i told myself it wa just overthinking  she didn t get bored of me  but yet    day later  she

480, i just got in an argument with my family who are annoyed at me  i got covid over one week ago and ive been sleeping the whole day even after i am feeling better  i already had depression but i just feel a lot more depressed these day     i have been unhealthy comparing myself to an obsessive point with this person who went to my high school and wa in my same graduating class who is now a somewhat successful singer  she got an opening spot for dua lipa and she ha campaign for coach and tommy hilfiger   i didnt even think about how much money she ha earned from those sponsorship and from her other work  it crazy to me to think if she ha over a million dollar and she didnt go to college  she sell her clothes on depop so i guess i thought that she wouldnt do that if she wa making that much  also i think she ha apartment in la and new york    my dream job is to be a singer and i feel like she is just living the lifestyle that i want  i know i shouldnt compare but i dont know how to not  im envious bc i want her life essentially or her accomplishment  i think i also worry that if she made it from our high school  it le likely that there is room for me  i dont really have room to talk cuz i have not tried  i dont really know where to start  i feel behind in life and i cant seem to get on track   please help  i just need some word to uplift and change my perspective  i feel im going down a dark spiral,depression
481,tldr  how can i help my friend with depression because of a toxic work environment   i have a close friend that is suffering in a bad way  they work in a very hostile environment and the last week ha pushed them very close to the edge  i dont think they will harm themselves or others but they are under a lot of stress and are the most depressed i have ever seen them    from what i have been told  their bos ha regularly called them a liar and said they lie all the time  they dont and are one of the most honest people i know   they have been repeatedly told by their bos that they are a failure even though they are one of the top productive people that work there  i work for a company contracted with them that allows me to see who is doing what performance wise     their co worker actually hate them because the bos make it very clear they dont like them and single them out every chance they get  i call it odd ball out management where there ha to be a them for the u to shame and berate    i know they went to hr a few year ago but were threatened with termination if they didnt let it go   my friend ha worked there for over   year and the pay is amazing  probably the most they have ever made  which is why they dont want to leave  they have looked into an attorney but cant find one that will take the case because it not a sure thing    what do i do to help ,depression
482,i dont know where else to ask for advice  and honestly i dont know why i even bother posting in the first place  but i recently got a girlfriend  weve only been together for like two month  so maybe it too early to say shes my gf but whatever   and tbh shes everything i could ask for  she actually want to spend time with me and she text me very often  we have sex very frequently  she like to make food for me  and we have a lot of stuff in common  we have almost the same sense of humor  we both enjoy calm and relaxing environment  and we both overall have similar personality  shes the first woman outside of my family who ha ever told me that she love me  i really couldnt ask for anything else from her    but im worried that one day shes going to realize that shes putting in way too much effort in our relationship  and shes going to get tired and just leave me  i try and put in a much effort a i can  i try and help out with chore  i buy her gift  i help pay for date  i make sure to tell her how much i love her but i worry thats not enough  but i dont want to be  too  overbearing because then shell leave me for  that  reason    i told her that sometimes i worry im not doing enough  but she say that i am  but i dont think i am  i feel like i should keep doing  something  so she doesnt realize that im not worthy of her love and her time    i guess i just want to show her that i am worth being loved  and that i want her to stay  but i dont want to be too clingy or weird ,depression
483,   f u   im trying not to let the depression take over my life  i dont have anyone to talk to except my boyfriend and my two year old    i like video game and collecting plushies and figurine  give me a chance  ,depression

485, i just got prescribed sertraline today for depression  ocd  and cptsd ptsd symptom primarily  ive never taken any antidepressant and ive always been anxious about the thought of not being able to control how it affect me  im particularly worried about increase in suicidal thought and weight gain  im already pretty passively suicidal and im only semi recovered  and sort of relapsing  from anorexia so gaining weight will be really hard for me  anyone have any thought from their own experience ,depression
486,is there such a thing a a psychiatrist who specializes in treatment resistant depression  i m in something like year    and just realized that this is someone who may exist  i ve been searching all over for listing and directory  and i m beginning to suspect that this isn t common outside of some research center such a emory  amp  mt sinai  basically  i m really really tired of in and out the door doctor who just tell me to keep on taking the same med  there are also all those ketamine clinic popping up  and i don t trust those doctor to do anything but recommend their expensive off label treatment  any advice on where to find good treatment for depression that hasn t responded to anything ,depression
487,sorry for rambling   i know these thing could be worse but they ve affected me greatly   i almost failed school because i ve been absent so much from  you guessed it  depression  none of my classmate know  i doubt they d care or understand anyway   my therapist seems to have ghosted me   my mom and my best friend forgot my birthday this year  though i m not a sad over it anymore since they both seemed genuinely remorseful   a really dear friend of mine died to suicide last year  people don t realise how often i really think about him  and how hard i miss him  and how i still feel like shit all the time because he s gone  i ve talked to my friend about it but it s like they forget  or they don t really care  it s like they don t realise i m constantly mourning  or they act like i m over it now  i don t know  i know i have to remind them but it s awkward doing that  i ve tried it  they don t seem to care  i feel like i already whine too much and that it s getting annoying so i try not to open up to my closest friend  they have depression too but they don t talk about it often with me  either i m not a close with them a i thought or they keep it to themselves  i don t know  it just feel disproportionate  so i try not to talk about it   i started self harming again this year  i m  hoping  it qualifies a sh  because it just feel like a pitiful imitation to me  i kind of have a shit pain tolerance so i only scratch the topmost layer of skin and don t draw blood because i m squeamish  the  scar  hurt like a bitch when i shower in the following few day  but they usually heal in under a week  i ve tried drawing blood before but it wa too uncomfortable for me  although i did feel very validated for a moment when i first managed it  i really wanna do it again someday because it feel like  the proper way  but i really don t like slicing  they feel like big papercuts  with how prevalent cutting a sh is it make me wonder if my skin is more sensitive than most people s or if i m just a pussy   i think i developed an eating disorder but it s hard to admit to myself  i feel embarrassed admitting this but it s only been   month  it s taken over my life  but i don t wanna go back because at the end of the day ed  are  coping mechanism and the disordered a fuck thing they make you do are to make you feel better  possibly over other thing happening in your life  and i ve got so much going on   i don t feel motivated to write anymore at all  i ve got so many idea and i m constantly writing them down  i have multiple wips and admittedly i m still passionate over the concept but i keep postponing writing because my current skill aren t good enough to do them justice  a year or so ago i started thinking my vocabulary wa too small so i should read more to improve it  before i can start writing again  i m still reading  i don t know when to stop  when i look at my writing  all i can think is that it s dogshit and it s going to be like that forever  i use too few word  too many word  it s purple prose  i phrase thing weirdly  my grammar suck  it s difficult to read  it s boring  it s never good enough  so i just don t even start  because i already know it s going to suck   drawing used to be my life passion but i can t do it anymore because of my disability  maybe only for an hour per week before the pain set in  and nobody give a shit  it s unfair  but nobody care  it make me actually want to kill myself because i wanna draw all the time  but i physically can t   sometimes my friend ignore my text and it really hurt  especially when i just vented about issue in my life like the one i mentioned above  when i confront them later they say they didn t know what to say  and admittedly most of my vent look similar  am i asking for too much  i expect a reply or some comforting word or a hug but i just don t get it  or when i do get it  it feel like they re saying it out of obligation  they don t say it  but i really think i m bothering them   my suicidal thought returned  dying seems like a catch all solution to everything fucking me up right now  mostly what motivates me is that my past wa imperfect and that nobody would miss me  maybe my mom would care but she d just be doing what mom are supposed to do  i m talking about my friend  would they really care   i think all that s stopping me from dying are rpg video game  sad music  and constant idea for art  that i can t do   i daydream all the time  i listen to music pretty much constantly when i m home  when i feel like shit  i listen to hurt by nin and sextape by deftones and just the band teen suicide a a whole  song like that  they help me feel better when i feel like people have failed me   it s enough to keep me going  but i m really hanging by a thread  not to sound edgy but it feel like i could snap at any moment if pushed too hard  and that could be it   i m struggling so much  and i can t stand how nobody really realises it  or at least it feel like it  i ve told people but they don t  know  ,depression
488,tw  self harm  i ve been clean from sh for like over   year  with one or two slip ups  but still i think i can count it a   year bc slip ups are normal   and i am really struggling right now  i m feeling really disconnected from myself and i can feel that itch underneath my skin  i want to scratch my skin off  because i hate myself  the weirdest part is that i am feeling fine  i am not sad  i am not angry  i think i am not really feeling anything  emotionaly i think i am feeling kind of positive  it make no sense  because all my brain can think is   i hate myself  i hate myself  i hate myself      my skin feel gross and i feel like a gross person  so i guess i want to punish myself with the sh  i mean i have had this feeling of my skin being gross a few time before  but i could never make it go away by like taking a shower or cleaning everything around me  this feeling doesn t usually bother me to be honest  i just try to ignore it  but sometimes i just can t  and i can t ignore it right now  i don t know what to do ,depression
489,ive grown increasingly wary of being asked how are you  are you feeling better  every day  i have depression n anxiety  and i struggle to sleep wake up and recently ive been ill for week  wow the flu this year really hit different    i know people who check on me when im sick care about me and i genuinely appreciate it so so much   but being asked every day if im better and being repeatedly asked that a few time a day for day and day  ik it not intentioned a that but it ha started to feel like a reminder to me that i am not better because i am still ill  i dont want to keep telling people im still ill and feel shite  i dont want to be a worry or burden to other people because im unwell  i feel more shit and i dont want to open up anymore about how i am feeling doing  one of my friend asked if im better repeatedly when i wa really ill and this ha just continued on and i just say the standard im fine how are you a a response cuz i dont want to worry them and also i feel like shit but i dont want to go into it cuz i feel like shit lol   also being repeatedly asked if im better make me feel pressured to have to be better and then i kinda feel like it not ok for me to be unwell and there something wrong with me for being ill and im a bad person for worrying other people  we love overthinking   also every time im asked if im better i focus my attention on how i am  how i wa  how i want to be and i dont enjoy repeatedly checking how im doing and feeling cuz im already feeling shit  it hard to separate how i am doing physically from mentally when i check if im better cuz both of those influence how i am doing   it probably end of term stress combining with the flu and causing me to be more sensitive to everything but i just felt like i needed to rant about this somehow  i feel like a bitch who doesnt appreciate anything but i also just feel so sick and done with everything ,depression
490,hi i m so depressed i have nobody to talk to no friend or boyfriend and i can t do this life anymore i just want to give up,depression
491,ive been looking into way to stab myself without actually dying  or feeling any major pain  just so that people will believe me when i say that im in need of mental health support  i have no idea what could possibly be wrong with me  and ive tried again and again with a gp to get to the bottom of thing but ive been undermined and turned away by too many professional to wait any longer  on another list  for the possibility of being recognised and treated    i am not suicidal  but if i have to do something drastic to prove that im unwell then so be it  the plan is to stab myself  possibly in the side of my thigh or stomach  be taken in for some kind of suicide watch and get evaluated that way  the only people who are listened to nowadays are those who are a danger to themselves and others  would this plan work ,depression

494,hey  i ve been meaning to drop out of college for a good while but i don t think i can bear the shame and guilt of it all  and even so  i have no other path to take after dropping out   i m losing a lot of meaning to my life the same way i feel like i ve been losing the significance that i ve always wanted to make in my existence  nothing seem to matter anymore   a much a i try to surround myself with people that bring me joy  and doing thing i love  they all feel like mere distraction from the kind of dead end i am currently facing   and even though i tell myself i m doing well in recovering from a heartbreak  i still get massive blow of sadness when i get these echo and reflection of my loneliness that appear almost everywhere   i don t know what to do anymore and i don t know how to feel good  i don t really know why i m still here    any advice or support would be nice  thank you ,depression

496,i couldn t maintain friendship with a lot of friend  but some of them are incredibly important to me but because of what i did  what they did  we just no longer talk   i ve kind of let go of the attachment over the year but it s strange  i still think about them   i also have friend i used to talk to half a year ago but it s awkward to message them now   i wish i tried harder to keep them  you know  i m already    now  and i have no one to message   that part hurt the most ,depression

498,welp  i survived to     and still alone    my parent kicked me out when i wa    and i ultimately found myself in montreal somehow  other side of the country   and it just struck me one day that i wa entirely alone in the universe  i wa socially autistic so i couldn t make friend even if i wanted to  didn t speak the language  wa     no one else my age on the street at the time   no family  no friend  no one in the universe who even knew of my existence    this wa my first brutal realization and it nearly killed me    over the course of my life  i grew  and matured  and learned  i made it a point to always be at very least  competent in everything i might ever have to do  and that turned into a way of life for me  that s stuck with me to this day  anything novel to me  i must become at least basically competent at it before i can let it go  this worked well in term of becoming a jack of all trade  and opened up an enormous amount of opportunity for me that simply aren t available to others  i now own several company  work from my kick as enormous rv  which i have parked in a literal junk yard  by choice   i m financially secure and can do anything i want      the problem is that i ve already done everything  and the only joy i find anymore  is in doing the thing i enjoy with someone else  sharing the experience  so i ve built this whole life up around that idea  i just always make sure i m in a position where if and when i ever find anyone i enjoy being around  the rest of the stage is already set  we just go share the experience      but i ve been alone my entire life  yea  i ve had a couple good relationship  usually     year   but i never felt connected to those people at a level i really wanted  it used to be because what i wanted wa just asking too much  and i realised that much of what i thought i needed  wa only additive  but a lack of it wasn t subtractive  perhaps this is maturity      my last gf of    year wa mostly fun  very sweet  incredibly caring  and generally pretty gangsta overall  but her absolutely insane insecurity with me always wore on me  for a decade   i wa never after anyone else  i wa never flirty with anyone  i ultimately spent    year walking on eggshell around her  trying to manage her insecurity by avoiding any possible trigger  but it wa emotionally exhausting a i empathise too deeply and she wa always so constantly upset that i might be into some girl      ultimately  she made the decision to leave for me  she outright accused me of sleeping with  or at least having a thing for this girl  we ll call her t   the reality wa that t wa the ex gf of some random guy i wa helping out  he wa destroyed over his breakup with t  i gave him a room in our house  bought him work boot and food  bought him a motorcycle so he could learn to ride and come for braaps with me and my gf  he wanted her back and would have her come out for rip with u  she had to ride on the back of my bike a i m the only one with a full license  i knew that t being on the back of my bike upset my gf  but i d given up on managing her emotion and she knew it wa fully her insecurity and nothing to do with me  it wa an awesome summer of braaps      then one day  t is over with her ex  they have a daughter together and she want to maintain some manner of friendship for their kid sake   i m out for my nightly run and a i approach my house  about   house away  there s t cry on the neighbour lawn  so for the first time ever  i stop and talk with her  i can t leave someone in that state  i d literally said perhaps one sentance to her prior over the past year   we chat for a few minute and i head home and am greeted by my gf and all the mate super upset with me  and of course no one will tell me why  i try to just be stoich  and i hate drama  so i just go have a shower  i come out    minute later for a cigarette  and buddy i ve been helping for the past year just say  so you enjoy fucking my girlfriend     wat      so somehow the entire house had decided that me and t had a thing for each other and had somehow fucked in the middle of a busy street  in the   minute i d stopped to talk to her  i pointed out how absurd this wa to everyone  but they didn t care  they alienated me for the next week  so i finally said  fuck it  i m leaving       went and stayed in an airbnb and while out for a run one night  i run into t in the park and we chat  she s in a bad situation with nowhere for her and her kid to live  and i need a temporary place till i figure out where i wanna go next  so we decide to get a place together for the time being  over the couple hour conversation  i realise me and this girl are absurdly socially compatible  it doesn t make sense  she s    and i m     she ha zero life experience  zero education  she s comically ignorant to reality and the world around u  but somehow  we connect socially almost instantly    so this quickly turn into a romantic thing  and here again  completely outta left field and for no goddamned good reason  we connect romantically  socially  emotionally  and sexually  a depth of connection in those four tenet like i ve never experienced before  it wa mind blowing      so we move into the place and it just get better  her child are awful  but i know how to handle kid  t is highly motivated around the house  but doesn t get anything else done  it s like she ha zero motivation outside our little life  the depth of our connection continues growing  it s absolutely nut how connected we are by   month in      and then she start getting depressed  then anxious  and then completely flip shit on me out of nowhere and i m the worst person she s ever met and i honestly can t figure out what she wa even remotely upset about  turn out she ha bpd  and it s severe      i ve got myself pretty well educated in medicine psychology neurology and various other science already  so i know how to research  and i research the fuck outta this  trying to figure out how to solve or at least manage it  or come up with a workable dynamic  no one s ever been successful  everyone i talk to who s ever been in a bpd relationship say  run  don t walk  run a fast and a far a you can right now   i know what they re saying  i know why they re saying it  if you stay in a bpd relationship  they will trauma bond the hell out of you  and in the end  you ll be the one in therapy  i can t decide if i m strong enough to be the exception but i think i am  but i understand cognitive bias     fuuuuck      but we continue on and make it to about a year  i buy u this enormous rv and all the toy so we can just go fuck off up north to enjoy our life  and it s incredibly good when it s good  and it s the most stressful  most brutally difficult year of my life  but i didn t know it before  but it wa the life i d always wanted needed  i had this girl  essentially my wife  and   kid  in this beautiful place where we can just roll outta bed and do literally anything we want in any direction  absolute freedom from everything  except from the bpd      long short  a with all bpd folk  t s behaviour towards me got progressively more disrespectful  hurtful  and eventually downright evil  no one ha ever treated me a poorly a she ha  and i ve never treated anyone a good a i treated her  i did absolutely everything for her and the kid and our life  and i did it with love every goddamned day  knowing full well it wa entirely possible the increasingly rare moment of beauty would slowly be supplanted by absolute hatred of me  no matter what i did  and that s absolutely what happened    she moved out at some point  burned all the bridge  and ultimately i had to leave town and go back to the city i hate  on the say i wa finally leaving  she found out i wa actually physically going to leave  and showed up cry  she love me  desperately love me  she know the issue are mostly in her court and that while i m not perfect  i ve been incredibly good to her and she doesn t want me to leave  but it s too late  i have to go for a bunch of reason now  so she s going to follow me  and we have a several hour discussion about her bpd issue and how we might address them  best conversation we ever had      she had to stay there a few week and i had to go get her early  the guy she wa staying with got a little rapey with her   so i drove    hour to pick her up and bring her back  and we get back and she ghost me almost entirely  she s distant  say she s madly in love but need space  i try to give it to her but any discussion about what s going on  and she flip shit on me and leaf the conversation very distinctly in a  we re probably broken up now but i won t actually tell you such  position  that s where we re at again now  i m trying desperately to just give her her space to see what happens  and trying to think of a new dynamic for our relationship that might be manageable  but it s the hardest thing i ve ever done in my life  i ve no idea if she s actually done at this point  or like all bpd folk  she s discarding me long enough that she s convinced i m convinced it s over  before running back and love bombing me  i m confident the cycle is totally subconscious and that there s nothing nefarious or malicious about it  i feel confident that s just her neurological prime directive  to find and build connection  and once she ha it  her brain doesn t know what to do  so it hit reset         now if i were sane  or if i honestly felt there wa anyone else out there for me  i d run  right now  a literally everyone ha suggested  but  i honestly don t think there is anyone else for me  i m an alien  my very few hard requirement simply aren t met by human  bpd people for some reason  partially due to the social behavioural mirroring  and also probably because they re insanely empathetic  just do it for me  so no matter how hard i want to believe i can find a mentally stable  and still fun partner  i just don t see it happening  i ve thought about this for nearly   decade  and i ve searched  and never found her  t is it for me  good and bad      and i have no fucking idea  for the second time in my life  what to do or how to cope  mushroom are helping ease shit  but they don t change the situation  they just take some of the stabbing away temporarily  i know there is probably nothing i can ever do to fix this girl  nor is there anything i ll likely do to help her help herself  she ha no reason to grow beyond her trauma  because she can have anyone she want by simply cloning them  she doesn t know this i don t think  but she probably look at me  by far the longest relationship of her life  by far the most stable and fun  and by far the best for her and her kid  a the sole source of all of her problem in life  this is ultimately what bpd doe to people and i can t control nor even really direct it  resistance is probably entirely futile       but i can t convince myself to give up  probably a combination of who i am and why i feel alone generally  plus just who she is and why i love her  and also probably the behavioural mirroring is just necessary for me  sigh    a odd a that sound   i m obviously neurologically trauma bonded  severely  but i feel like i m still able to operate pretty objetively given i d already considered all these thing prior to this situation  but i don t see

508, not sure if it necessary but tw for depressive venting   im     unemployed for the past two year  and suffer from pretty bad brain fog  social anxiety  and major depression  not diagnosed but i have all the symptom  hopelessness  loss of interest  suicidal ideation  etc     i wa asked by my father if i could show up to his house tomorrow to observe and learn from some people who are going to rebuild an apartment in his property  the main problem that i have with this is that my father might not be there and ill be alone with these stranger  i feel so ashamed to even type this because i know im far too old to still be this shy  it just that im also far too messed up mentally and emotionally to be around anyone at all    i cant answer simple and common question like  what do you do for a living   what are your goal in life   what do you do for fun   i have an answer for all of these question but there no way in hell that im going to answer them truthfully  and im terrible at lying  what do i do for a living  nothing  why not  because i have terrible social anxiety and my brain fog ha handicapped my cognitive ability  what are your goal in life  i dont have any  why  because everything seems impossible from my perspective and the only thing that im interested in accomplishing  literally  is to not be depressed anymore  what do you do for fun  nothing  everything bore me  i have all the time in the world to pick up a hobby  yet nothing ever entices my attention    i suppose i can just lie about something and hope that they dont press further with more question  but im not very good at lying  first i have to come up with the lie  then elaborate on the lie even further if questioned about it  and try to do it all convincingly  i have to fake enthusiasm about something that i genuinely dont care about  not easy  it even more difficult when i already dont feel genuine enthusiasm for anything  i cant fake being normal even if my life depended on it  i know it isnt healthy to think this way but if i had to describe myself to anyone  truthfully  it would be by my depression  it would be by my social anxiety  it would be by my stress  ive been robbed of so many thing in life by these thing  the most tragic being my personality    what do i do  im already stressed out and ashamed about being unemployed  i dont want to disappoint my father even more  he say he isnt  but what father wouldnt be disappointed of their deadbeat burnout son  i dont blame him   i feel a though i should go  it supposed to be beneficial for me  but i just dont know how to handle being around others in whats undoubtedly the darkest period of my life right now  can i trust that a bunch of blue collar guy will take pity and be understanding of my situation  absolutely not  i dont want anyones sympathy  sympathy ha never existed for me  i just want to be fucking normal  the problem is that i simply cant fake it  id hide my anxiety and depression from the rest of the world if i could  ive let my mental illness grow out of control by leaving it untreated and now i feel that im at my wit end  suicide isnt supposed to be the answer but i cant help but think that it often is  i often cant see my future consisting of anything more than managing this losing battle with my depression  whats the point   what do i do tomorrow  if i do decide to go  what advice do you offer  ive been in social isolation for more than two year now  i dont remember how to interact around people ,depression

511,i have been struggling with depression since i wa a kid  the first time i remember feeling like i wasn t worth anything wa probably       yr old  i m    now  so i ve had depression for         year  but wasn t officially diagnosed until   year ago  i m sick of living this life where i sabotage every academic and career building opportunity that come my way and at this point  i m not sure if i m just innately lazy or if it the depression  i m so tired of being overweight  and i feel so disgusting that i sometimes can t even look in the mirror or at picture of my self  i avoid leaving the house because i don t like the idea of other people seeing me  i know that the few rare time i haven t gotten in my own way  i ve been able to do well in school  but my motivation is so fleeting and even though i managed to hold on by a thread  there wa a time where i almost didn t graduate college  mainly because of my intense procrastination  i did end up graduating this year  after remediating some course  and i m in grad school now  with eventual hope to go to med school  however  i struggle to even get out of bed  most day  and because my class are online  i don t have to get out of the house much and i ve been doing the bare minimum to pas my class  i m lucky that my parent still financially support me  but somehow that make me feel even worse because i know that there s so many people out there who have it worse off than me  so i shouldn t be complaining  even though i m on med and been going to therapy for the last two year  nothing ha worked to make me feel like le of a po  i don t have any friend  other than my dog lol  and there s no one in my life who know what i m going through  i ve tried explaining to my parent  but they say that it make them uncomfortable to hear about what i m going through  i want to know  doe it ever get better  is it possible to ever stop feeling like such a failure  is my brain going to be like this forever  is there a way to stop feeling like this ,depression
512,hello  m     my life never wa too complicated  yes  my parent got divorced     year ago  mother wa an alcoholic  but apart from that  i wa growing up completely ok  i wa very qurious  active and happy child  never had problem in studying  because i really loved it  and a few year back my happines started just to fade away without me noticing it  can i put that to word  just life itself started to become le    interesting  i started to have problem with connecting with people  stopped caring about thing   when someone doe something good for me  i literally don t care  i rarely genuinely laugh  i lost my motivation to do stuff  it can take more than hour to actually get out of bed in the morning  i m not truly interested in a lot of thing   never had any work  and i truly don t know who would possibly pay me to do something because now i suck at literally everything  i m ashamed to be financially dependent on my father  i m ashamed that i m le successful than literally anyone around me  i m a failure and although i m currently in university it doesn t mean that i ll have a job afterwards  at least well paid  i m not talking about being wealthy  i almost don t have any joy in life  and i don t have motivation to change something and yeah  i hate myself for that even more  this year i started to have suicidal thought  because i don t see my purpose both to myself and society  and yeah  in the morning it get a little better  but then it s another evening and another wasted day   i just struggle every day and wait for it to be over and than again and again  my natural behaviour scare people away  so almost everytime when i have a social interaction i pretend to be an another person   better version of myself  just because i want at least some social interaction  you may call it a coping mechanism  after all  being alone is not a good thing for mental health   and i know that a lot of my thought are irrational  like i hate to see happy people  because it reminds me of my own misery  for example  it is hard for me to speak with my older sister  although i love her very much  because she is such a strong person  travel a lot  meet up with a lot of interesting people  doe a lot of cool stuff  make money and just living her best life  i don t wish her to be unhappy  but i can t be happy for her  because i m such a pitiful joke   anyway  if you read all this  probably i can say  thank you for caring   but even though logical part of my brain will really thank you  the sensual crap of me won t feel any emotion from this side  no offense  it s just me ,depression

532,a note to my best friend  the love of my life  the one person i ve ever felt truly connected to  the one who i d hoped would one day truly understand me and the one who ultimately lead me here to the end  i doubt carly will ever even read this but someone should    chrysanthemum represent longevity  fidelity  optimism and joy      a red chrysanthemum would symbolize love and passion  this is all i ever sought to give you  i never cared if you d touch me if i could touch you  i just wanted to be close to you  all i ever did wa try to be close to you  connected to you and make you feel wanted and worthy  confident  becauseyou are amazingin so many way     yellow chrysanthemum represents neglected love and sorrow  when i went to you cause i felt neglected by the others i even said to my therapist that in the worst case scenario i d still have you a a friend  even if everyone else abandoned me i thought you would stay in my life  i never even questioned it for a second  but you turned your back on me  insisted you talk to the others first so you could convince them that the only reason i wa hurting wa because of my illness  you didn t want to see how their action were hurting me because to you they ve done nothing but help but we were not treated the same in the slightest  when you were feeling down everyone berated you with well wish and meme and gift and love but when i wa down you were the only one there ever willing to help me while the others scorned me for even asking     white chrysanthemum represent loyalty and honesty  this is truly all i ever expected from you carly  but constantly you help back your feeling and your thought  you refused to share them with me and because we couldn t connect on that level of understanding one another you grew impatient of my ability to understand you  there wa a time after we watched loving vincent and afterwords we shared a conversation about the effect of depression and suicidal thought  through that conversation i felt so close to you cause it wa the only time you allowed me to share those thought in way that made me feel safe and welcome  any other time i tried to talk about these thing that pained me so much i could feel your discomfort  like i wa disappointing you but i just wanted you know what i ve been through  to better understand who i am a a person and i so very often feel misunderstood  now more than ever     violet chrysanthemum represent a wish to get well  this is truly all i wanted from olivia  sam and marissa  i don t want for them to solve my problem  or be there to listen to me sob and scream and shout in agony a i sat on the brink of ending it all over and over again  i just wanted for them to tell me id be okay  thatd tell me i could make it through even just one more  that eventually i would feel okay and i just need to hang on but until then i d always have a friend in them and that if i need to i could lean on them  instead a i reached my hand out to them they shoved ut thats never what i did  i just wanted someone to believe i wa strong when i couldn t believe it myself and now there s no one who will believeme to ground  accused me of blaming my illness on them  putting the burden of my life and my death on them b and i don t think there ever will be ,depression

565,hi all  i ll keep this a brief a possible to give the most context with the smallest wall of text i can manage   my girlfriend of over a year wa on antidepressant for a while but recently started slowing down on taking them  citing that she thought they made her stomach hurt  until finally a week or so ago she stopped entirely  i don t have have never been diagnosed with depression so i didn t make much of it   earlier this week  she started getting   really   down  i wa completely surprised that she could hit that level  she started feeling the symptom of depression  you know   everything is boring  why are the day so long    and even telling me once that sometimes she just want to die  after a while of me naively trying to console her  she began expressing a desire to break up and just be alone  of course i fought against it with logic  thinking it would help because she s a logical person  i told her a million time that i wa more than willing to be there for her while she work through this  told her that i loved and cared for her deeply  encouraged her to talk to her therapist or her doctor  and just generally tried to give her what she asked for when it wa a reasonable request  i asked that she didn t shut me out because i am the only one she feel comfortable talking about anything with and she won t even talk to me about this   after doing a bit of research  she contacted me later in the week to see if i could chat and  maybe entertain  her  she told me she wa going to start painting a little  because i had been trying to get her to do at least a little painting to get started because i read that doing accomplishable task is therapeutic  she started expressing her woe that there were still four hour left in the day and i told her that it wa easier than she might think to lose sense of time while taking on something like painting and to prove it  i decided to send her a low detail something i drew that  while having low detail  still took over an hour to do  i also told her  a an effort to give her back some control of the situation  that we could take a break on the relationship a per her request  with the condition that she allows me to continue to support her  to which she agreed  i sent the drawing right after we hung up  and she almost immediately responded  she said that she had deleted my contact info and all my message  this isn t the first time that happened  she s very particular about phone space  and that we shouldn t talk for a while   what s advisable in this situation  i want so badly to help her get the professional help she need before something happens  she s on a college campus right now  pretty much all alone  and her parent are    hour away  here s something else  i have her car right now because she wa allowing me to use it while my car is waiting to get repaired  since the semester is close to out  i ll obviously be returning it when she asks for it back soon  what should i do when i bring it back  how should i approach her  what s the call on letting her parent know so that    someone    close can help her   tldr  girlfriend broke up after she stopped taking her antidepressant and is now all alone without any support system  i wa borrowing her car when we broke up  so what can i do to get her help when i go see her   thanks in advance for any feedback ,depression

567,i do not wish to explain my reason  a i assume all those who understand will understand and all those that don t  won t  however  there is this point in which we reach a wall due to the stigma  we have evaluated our situation  we know it s what we want  but we are alone  instead of being supported  understood  allowed  we are judged  labelled a sick or insane  blamed and attacked  those that could help u  do not for they could get in jail for    to    year  in some country  even by doing it to oneself one might be arrested if surviving  that is the world we live  no matter how capable of making the decision we may be or how propaganda claim we are free  to end our life is not a right we have  the system doesn t trust or acknowledge individual human judgement on this matter  we are left to our device  ending up choosing way that are highly destructive and painful  it s why i m still alive  i won t allow even one antidepressant pill to enter me  i already live enough of a facade  the method i know    require courage  are lonely and incredibly painful  i didn t want to be another dead eye man  walking hopelessly amid a crowd or spending his life on a couch or bed  i didn t want to suffer for decade only because my government pretend it care  yet  i live in the dark and for now  it s what i do   lady and gentleman  you know the rule  here  you may not write a you wish  you must obey  write only what you are allowed  else this post and your comment will be deleted  within the confines of this madness  i do hope you find a way to communicate ,depression

603,i m sorry this is so long  you don t have to read it  but the most important thing i have to say is  i m struggling with horrible thought and really just need someone to talk to and tell me it will be okay   i m a student  last year i started studying in university but my mental health failed and i hated the study programme so i dropped out  this year i started studying again  this time something that i enjoy  i wa doing so well for the first two month  then in november  my alcoholic mom visited someone who felt sick and got infected with some virus  and of course infected me too    long story short  i wa sick pretty much the whole month of november and didn t attend any lecture  my mental health got horrible again  but i try to keep going  i have two really difficult test next week that i m completely unprepared for  i m pretty sure i ll fail them because of how many lecture i skipped  i also had a presentation today  that i already had to do two week ago but i asked the professor to let me do it today  i wa very prepared and exited to do it  but somehow at   a m  i pressed snooze on my alarm and kept sleeping    until   p m  the presentation wa at      p m  i hate myself so much  this ha never ever happened before and i have no idea why i slept until the evening  seriously i m horrified that i woke up this late  and my whole sleeping schedule is fucked now  i wa already feeling horrible for skipping all of november and now this   i feel like such a failure  i don t want to drop out again but i feel like i might fail  of course  i ll try my hardest not to  i told myself that if i fail this year i ll end my life  i don t want to do that  but i just don t see what i can do with my life if i fail  i feel so depressed  i don t even remember the last time i had a normal meal  the worst part is  i live in a country where mental problem are not seen a a big deal or even real so if i talk to someone about my feeling they will only make joke or just say something that make it worse ,depression

634,if you are going through really horrible depression  is it better to distance yourself from every one until you can get help  or if it ok to get help from loved one  what is reasonable to request from the people around    when it really hard  what is the minimum needed to not get labeled a someone who just sitting around not trying  how do you maintain empathy from those around you without draining them  how do you avoid turning them numb to you  effort im so sure  is it just effort    i ruined my last relationship  and pretty much burned bridge with most people in my life because of my emotional issue  and who i am a a person  i either dont open up to people at all or i open up too much  im not just putting the blame on my mental issue a i should have been better long time ago    staying away from people so i dont hurt any more people by my lack of every thing is the route i go  but going forward  how do i know when im asking too much during episode  when to leave every one alone    i think i get so caught up in my sadness  and how hard it feel to pull myself out  that i dont take into account how difficult that can be for people around ,depression

637,i feel like i ve been so repetitive with how i have been feeling lately  right now i have passive suicidal ideation  but i know that i would not actually kill myself  i feel immobile and don t see a reason moving forward  like i don t really have anything to look forward to   ever since fall semester started of my first year here in grad school  i feel like with each month that pass by  i don t know what i want to do with my life  one of the very reason of me attending grad school wa to build up my resume cv with more knowledge and experience  but i just feel more lost than when i started  now i am not looking forward to finishing this degree because i m kind of forced to take on a full load in a place where i am located that i absolutely despise  at this rate i am expected to graduate next year   i knew that this would be a burden for me to carry  but i had some trip aligned during the christmas break that i wa supposed to go on  amp  during the spring break of next semester that were just cancelled  with these trip in mind  i thought that having these thing to look forward to would lessen the burden  if there s one thing i have learned about myself is that i am a planner and having thing planned give me a reason to look forward to thing   my dad travel for his job and since i have been feeling more hopeless with what i want to do in life  i wa thinking to myself about if it would be possible to work with him since this is what i am looking for in a job  the problem is that this is just a recent thought and i haven t even brought it up to him  i am not sure how i could even work with him since it is a niche job  the trip that were planned were done by him and it really bother me that he invite me and the rest of my family on these trip that aren t finalized to just realize we can t go on them  my parent do this a lot  they make plan or promise to do thing with u  but then we can t do them anymore due to unforeseen circumstance or bad communication  i wish that they could keep their mouth shut instead of getting our hope up on stuff that may or may not happen   it also doesn t help that i really don t have a reliable person i can talk to about these thing or communicate how i truly feel  other than my therapist  right now i live in two different state and travel to either one infrequently  each place i go to i don t feel like i truly belong there  like i am just a shadow or an outsider  i only have mere acquaintance and another reason why i wanted to attend grad school wa hoping to make connection  but i haven t really done so  it s also hard for me to date and i have been questioning my sexuality a well   i feel like this post make me very self centered  privileged  and spoiled  it make me wonder if i am a bad person  i feel like i am in middle school all over again  the point where i am angry with  every  single person  i am starting to resent and despise my colleague  my roommate  everyone  the other day i made a post saying that i find it annoying that my roommate is always getting package and i wa really getting torn at about how it s such a small thing to be annoyed and angry about  i deleted it because i realized that it wa really immature and inconsiderate to be annoyed by something like that   i m such a miserable person and i feel like i get angry and overwhelmed by mundane and little thing  like my roommate getting package all the time  i loathe myself and i feel like food ha really been the only thing that keep me happy and what i look forward to  i ve been gaining weight with how much i have been relying on food a my source of happiness  there s something wrong with me and i don t feel like a good person      i am embarrassed to post this and i hope i don t regret it  gt   lt ,depression

697,i ve seen a therapist on and off since my mid twenty  it s never seemed to help   i m currently looking for one again  not with any hope that it will somehow be different this time  only because i m desperate  truthfully  this new search is filling me with dread  more money spent  more time wasted   i ll be paying someone so i can dump my problem on them  only to be asked   how doe that make you feel   i know how my life make me feel   like shit   after the hour end  if i ve opened up  i feel drained  frozen  more depressed  and more anxious than before  it s because of this miserable routine that i eventually start cancelling appointment at the last minute  or failing that  attend and try my best to avoid the conversation that cause this prolonged awareness of how awful everything is  i m left feeling like the  healthy  state is one where i m acutely aware of how overwhelmed and miserable i am  this boil over into the conclusion that thing are too fucked for remedy   when i ve brought this up with therapist in the past  i ve been told this is normal  and that it s going to get worse before it get better  well  they ve been right about the first part   so here i am  back again  desperate for respite  willing to pretend my disbelief is suspended  latching onto the next bit of false hope like a life boat with an obvious leak  even writing this  shouldn t i feel some therapeutic effect  i don t  giving it a once over before hitting submit  i feel pathetic   how can therapy help if i don t believe it can  how can i believe in it if there s no evidence  personally  supporting that conclusion ,depression

699,since i wa    year old i ve always dreamed of starting my own animation studio  now i m    year old  and while i never made bad life decision in the sense of drinking myself silly and getting addicted to drug  i did end up taking the safe route and worked the traditional factory laborious job   my overall goal is to get myself into a situation where in the very least  i can do what i want without really having to worry about anything  and generally i seek to do that through finding way cheaper rent any mean necessary  whether it through a craigslist situation or facebook marketplace  or if i cant find anything that s not super sketchy  then i ll just straight up move to a different country   generally all the job i m qualified to attain are both boring  an absolute waste of time  and only pay me enough to afford an apartment in which i need a roommate to support me   so  i ve essentially given up on ever achieving love in my life  while i m generally decent looking  maybe a        financially wise  i ll never be able to justify how much it going to actually cost to be able to support a woman  no woman want to hang out with someone damn near    who isn t at least living alone   in any case  whatever  this isn t even a part of the biggest problem i have    i have major insomnia  and because of this  i have chosen by my own will to work a night shift job  i work  pm to  am  i m also in minnesota  and it is cold a fuck outside right now  in addition to that  when i go to bed  it dark out  when i wake up  it dark out   i didn t want to resign this lease last summer but i did  and it fucking suck  and that s on me  but the main thing i think about right now is this     i try my best to be active  and i do good at that  i m in good shape and i m proud of that  but everything else outside of what to me is a pointless job is almost like unachieveable   i have zero energy for anything outside of dragging myself to the gym  sometimes i do proper workout  sometimes i feel like i m straight up going to fall asleep in the gym   so when it come to animation  planning  trying to learn how to code so i can get a different more interesting career  you can forget it   so  this is what i ve been thinking lately     can i just skip this part of my life  like can i just not try at all  i mean  who care right  im just going to not sleep one random night  and then my skin is going to feel like it peeling off of my body like a snake  so instead of trying so hard to attempt to achieve something  wouldn t it be better if i just drown myself in videogames for the next   month until this lease is over  just press the skip button for this chapter ,depression

710, excuse my profanity  this situation ha me angry af and his action triggered childhood trauma which led me to spiral into a depressive episode  essay below  sorry   so there s this guy in my ministry that i pretty much hate now because he started ignoring my existence for reason i can t figure out  i ve kept my true feeling about him outside of anyone in the ministry to try to avoid a much drama a possible than there already ha been  but now close friend who i never told what happened are acting cold towards me  i only told my best friend i grew up with outside the ministry  thank god for them  they re so real and have been there for me in so many way  nice having a tight friend outside the church that are very realistic about the world  and my therapist  the two friend group don t know each other      what happened      oh boy   here we go  during the beginning of the semester there wa this guy in the ministry that liked me on a dating app  so i sent him a like back because i somewhat already knew him  we re in the same group  i thought he wa cute and wa open to getting to know him  before then  he rarely said hi to me and we had a few casual surface level conversation so i thouht maybe he wa just shy  i thought maybe this could be the start of something nice   wish i could slap myself now for thinking that    anyway  i thought that he would see the like i sent him and message me or say something to me in person about it  week went by  nothing  even after i followed him on sm  cricket  i did notice he approached me during a conversation i wa having with a friend which he never really doe and i caught him staring at me a lot in group meeting  when he did join in on a conversation i wa my friendly self can t think of anything i said to offend him  to me this doesn t really mean anything and wa just friendly platonic interaction  he never really made a move  but then he just dropped off the face of the planet and started acting like i didn t exist anymore    he would talk to my other friend but skip me  one time he bumped my shoulder while i wa talking to some friend and he didn t even bother to turn around and say excuse me like most people would  just kept walking like nothing happened  my friend noticed and all kind of looked at each other and thought it wa a bit rude  he stopped saying hi to me completely  i could see him actively avoiding me  there were several time when i said hi or smiled towards him in a friendly way and he completely ignored me like i wasn t there  i even messaged him asking if he wa okay after people said he got sick  he responded with very few word and didn t even say thank you for checking in on me when i saw him in person  he didn t even say hi to me back  this really hurt my feeling  especially with not knowing why  i decided he clearly doesn t want me near him  so i left him alone completely  i blocked him on social medium and returned the favor    a few week go by of me ignoring him back and my friend noticed he wa in a corner looking sad by himself at an event and felt so sorry for him they went over to talk to him  i didn t go over there and proceeded to talk to the people next to me  what else am i supposed to do with someone who act like that towards me  i didn t feel bad for him one bit  if what i did hurt his feeling  oh fucking well  i don t give a shit  i m not begging for the attention of a person who ignores me and it s pointless to do so  i can t change whatever his opinion is of me    i only told one close friend in the ministry that i had a crush on him but even if she did tell him that  i don t think it would ve warranted that response  this whole situation ha caused me so much fucking stress and triggered a depressive episode because i could not figure out why he wa ignoring me  i didn t understand what i could ve done that would warrant that reaction  we never even talked enough or had any deep conversation  when i blocked him for his behavior  i realized he doesn t even deserve to know what s going in my life  i didn t tell anyone except my besties outside the group    this wa so triggering for me because i had an older cousin who wa like a sister to me ghost my family for a decade after her parent s divorce when i wa a kid  tbh my family wa never the same afterwards  all we did wa love her and be there for her  we would call on her birthday and try to invite her to family function but never got a response  so we cut our loss and moved on  we can t force her to spend time with u  she tried to come back a few year ago but most family member  including me  were hurt  she burned a lot of bridge  she wa also a horrible guest at the few thing she went to after a decade of ignoring u  would be drunk  a no show  and took advantage of our willingness to give her a second chance    back to story  the worst part is i feel like the close friend i ve made in the ministry are starting to act cold towards me  i don t know if he told them anything or if he s making up lie about me  but that made me feel furious af  do y all think maybe he told some people i blocked him on sm and now they think i m the bad guy  if that is the case  i probably would drop the whole entire group and wouldn t trust anyone  i specifically never told anyone in the group how i really felt about him so thing wouldn t be awkward and they would feel like they had to choose side  i understand they had their friendship before i came in the group last semester and that s fine  i don t care for him a long a we stay out if each other s way and keep our distance  but if he s starting up some shit i don t know about  i m afraid i ll have to leave everyone  i can t stand or deal with people like that  and it s even more concerning if my friend side with him even after seeing his behavior towards me  i really don t know what to do   i ve met some really amazing people in the group but his existence and behavior make me want to leave so i don t have to deal with him ,depression

712,so i live in pakistan and idk what school are like in other country but here no school take u if ur too old for a grade im    rn and im supposed to be in grade   but im in grade    im out of school now but when i went to school a few week ago i wa in grade    so here basically what happened that led me to being in  th grade at    yr of age  i got all e in midterm exam of grade   which wa in       then in march of      the coronavirus spread and school closed  my friend use to take online class but i didnt  for a couple of month until the school cancelled my admission bc my parent hadnt payed the fee for over a year  now i wa out of school and way behind all my friend  and i didnt give a shit i wa like    yr old and rly happy i didnt have to study anymore i hated all my teacher and i had shit friend they use to make me feel terrible about myself  a year went by and i dont rememeber it very well like the memory is kind of blurry but i think i started spending alot of time on my phone and my parent didnt like that and id ask them what else am i supposed to do and wed fight over that  and theyd take my phone away and hide it somewhere and i would freak out and start physically fighting them  ive always had social anxiety too ive always had a rly low self esteem and ive always hated myself and being around ppl always made me uneasy so my social anxiety also got so much worse bc i wasnt going to school anymore and the only ppl i ever interacted with were my parent  it wa like i wa addicted to opioids except the opioids were my phone and whenever my parent took my phone away i would start having actual withdrawal symptom like anger and then cry so hard that id start hyperventilating  eventually my parent gave up on me and let me have my phone and i would just lay in bed all day and do stupid shit on my phone  i had become very depressed by the time i wa     bc i never went outside and i wa always bored and my life just rly fucking sucked  i hadnt brushed my hair in month and they were all tangled up  i use to have rly long hair  and i also had an eating disorder im not sure if this is an eating disorder it just disordered eating if that make sense  i wa grossed out by meat and vegetable too and the only thing i ever ate were french fry so i had become rly malnourished and kind of thin too  not rly tho  my parent say i had gotten rly thin but i dont think so i just wasnt fat at the time i wa healthy  anyway  so i had become rly depressed by the time i wa    and my mental health wa progressively getting worse by the day and a year later i started getting panic attack everyday and i would always be cry and i would always just feel so fucking terrible  i also cut all my haie off one day bc i just fucking felt like it  so my parent took me to a psychiatrist and i didnt want to go to a psychiatrist bc at the time i thought only  crazy  ppl go to see a psychiatrist so i wa rly pissed that im being taken to a psychiatrist i felt like everyone thought i had gone crazy and my relative did too but not my parent  my relative def thought i had went crazy bc i would never come out of my room whenever they would come over and on those rare instance when i had to interact with them i would act rly strange so they thought that being in my room for so long made me lose my mind  thats just what i think they thought tho i dont know  anyway  so my parent forced me to go to the mental hospital with them and i cried alot and i wa just fucking pissed and so i didnt talk to the doctor at the hospital at all i didnt say a single word and he prescribed me a bunch of med and when i came home i googled what they were for and it said on google that theyre for bipolar disorder or schizophrenia or for ppl who hallucinate or are manic and i started panicking bc these r like rly bad illness and i thought that the doctor thought i have all these illness bc i didnt talk to him so he just assumed that im insane  it took me some time to figure out what the med were for and in pakistan they dont tell u what ur diagnosis is so i just diagnosed myself with social anxiety and major depressive disorder bc thats what my med were for and a for my stupid relative they just thought that i wa out of control so the doctor gave me sleeping pill to keep me calm xd theyre so fucking stupid  anyway  i went to   different school last year and this year and i couldnt cope with the environment at either of the school so now im out of school again and the med are doing all they can but im still just so fucking depressed there only so much the med can do my life fucking suck u cant have a life like this and not be severely depressed i never have anything to do i live in pakistan and im biologically a female and i have social anxiety so going outside alone for a walk or something is just not possible for me which piss me tf off it not fair i wanna be able to walk the earth i wa born and im a human and so it my right that i get to walk on the earth why is it that i dont get to be outside and the stupid men do it not fucking fair  i want to leave this country but i cant bc i never got proper education after grade    i honestly just feel so lost i dont wanna live like this forever i want to escape but there just no way for me to do that  if u read this post up until this point i would rly appreciate it if u commented and told me how i can leave the country and live independantly for the rest of my life,depression

722,i have never been fired before    i started this job exactly two week ago  im a medical assistant this is my  th medical assistant position  i left my old job after   year and   month because it wa starting to become very draining  and toxic  the doctor at this new job reached out to me on indeed and said my resume peaked her interest and she would like for me to apply  i applied and wa called immediately and said she really liked me  on a friday nov   th   then  i interviewed in person monday afternoon and wa hired and asked to start  friday  nov   th   i started and i thought thing were great  i wa only trained briefly on their triaging emr system for le than half the day and wa left to work on my own  i then wa trained on administrative task  i thought i caught on very quick  monday   th wa my birthday they got me a cake  gift card  on wednesday   th the coworker that ha supposedly worked with her for    year texted me and said youre doing great work btw  keep up the good work     i get into work this morning and at the nurse where i sit  all of my stuff is shoved off to the side and there another chair and computer sitting at the station  and the doctor introduces a girl x and the doctor say this is x she is an old employee of mine and im very glad that she ha come back and in my head im like there isnt enough work for there to be   medical assistant at lunch time im told the doctor want to speak to me  i go into her office and she say im sorry but unfortunately it not working out there is no chemistry here  you dont make a good fit here  and that i need to gather my stuff and leave  i wa too stunned and embarrassed to speak  so i got my stuff and left    like i really left my full time job because she seemed like she wanted me to work for her so bad  but to fire me because she hired an old employee back and didnt want or need me anymore  and then lie to me and blame it on chemistry    i feel so defeated and i never thought that i would feel so insecure and beat down for getting fired  ive never been fired  i feel betrayed and lied to and disheartened  i never want to work in the medical field again tbh  i dont even want to look at my scrub  i never want to wear a pair again  i think of all the disrespect and ugliness and attitude ive gotten from provider  i developed severe anxiety during the pandemic and working in it  and the only reward i ever felt wa when i made connection with patient and they appreciated me    life ha already been really hard this year ,depression
723,my mom is currently having bipolar attack since she found out my dad wa cheating on her   month ago  even thou he broke up with the other woman and ha been spending the whole day every day with her she keep getting angry and arguing with him for no reason and when you ask her why she always say she can t forget what he did  i made them go to therapy but it didn t help her and the psychologist even said she wa gonna send her to a psychiatrist cause nothing changed and since i live with them and have to be watching her so she doesn t try to kill him like she already did   i feel like i m living in a torture house  i m so stressed that i ve even told them to brake up if they can t live togheter anymore but they wanna stay togheter and that make me have to watch her like a cop waiting for a thief to try to rob something so he can stop him  i wish i could move alone and live a peaceful life but i wouldn t be able to do it cause i would be thinking about her mental health and what she could do next   i wish i coulf make her go to the psychiatrist to see if she get better with whatever he gaves her but she say she ain t crazy and she won t take any drug so there s nothing i can do to make her go back to normal ,depression
724,   to start off  im aware that im not well  i am diagnosed with major depressive disorder  social anxiety disorder  ptsd  and insomnia  those are just the mental health one  for continuity i also have  migraine  spine nerve joint damage  and suspected neurological immune disorder such a fibromyalgia  or myalgic encephalomyelitis  also suspect high blood pressure  low testosterone   i am going to attempt to articulate this a absolutely clearly a i can  which a much detail a i can  and not leave anything out that i may think is relevant  this is not meant to be linear or chronological at all  just a big  unfiltered collection of thought and feeling    amp  x   b    amp  x   b   anyways  for the point of this post  i feel like there is something else wrong with me  mentally    in the past  i have had self suspicion of adhd  autism  i took some online test for autism from  rdos net  http   rdos net   and  embrace autism com  http   embrace autism com    i know  i know  online test  i thought the same thing  i mostly took them a a haha  let just see thing   bipolar  type ii  i know there are two type  and one of them resonated much more   and borderline personality   ive taken test for these last two  a well  a do i research  read  and look meme for all of these  and relate to  understand  and empathize with many of the thing i see    amp  x   b    amp  x   b   ive never mentioned any of these  the suspected mental condition  besides the adhd to any doctor out of fear of getting in trouble  i wa in the military   i also have been too scared to ask out of fear of sounding insane  stupid  or looking like a hypochondriac  see  military medicine  military folk will understand if you ever had a not so good pcm   in general  i am very worried about what people think of me and if they like me  i dont like upsetting people  additionally  i also am fearful of the doctor not believing me  i think this way because ive had doctor blow me off before  one psychologist told me  you cant have ptsd  you meet every symptom and criterion  but since you have depression you cannot also have ptsd  i later asked him about this  and he denied it  my second example is when i brought a condition up to my doctor  asked if we could look into it  and he didnt    amp  x   b    amp  x   b   i feel like i have some of these thing ive mentioned because i am aware that i am weird and different than most people  i label myself a chaotic  neurodivergent  neurotic  atypical  etc  i also label myself a an asshole  douchebag  piece of shit  and pathetic excuse for a human    amp  x   b    amp  x   b   i sometimes feel like im generally smarter than most people  and this feeling exhaust and annoys me  it always seems like i know how to do more thing  or i wont understand how i know so much more information about a subject of discussion that this person should know  or i will be genuinely shocked how one of my friend who share a similar hobby doe not know something so simple about the subject they revolve their personality on  for example  the quality of thing  how do my friend not understand the occasional time when it is absolutely necessary to spend more on an important product  thing like a part for a gun  where your medical first aid supply come from  or buying a certain higher priced piece of gear from a reputable manufacturer rather than the    rd of a priced one from amazon that look just the same  ive had to teach several of my friend  some even who are older than me  how to apply for a checking account or a credit card  why it important to build credit  or why you shouldnt use a    tourniquet from china in your medical kit  i just thinkwhy am i having to teach several adult these basic thing their parent shouldve taught them  but  i am always willing to accept new information  and i am humble enough to admit when i am wrong and stand corrected when i am proven wrong  with good information  if someone just say  no  youre wrong  and refuse to elaborate  it extremely piss me off    amp  x   b    amp  x   b   so  it not like im a narcissist  in fact  i hate myself  mentally and physically  and if i ever feel good about anything about myself physically  shortly after my brain i will tell myself i should feel good  im disgusting  my body is fucking awful and im fucking ugly  etc     amp  x   b    amp  x   b   on the contrary  however  i sometimes feel like im genuinely fucking stupid  thick skulled and smooth brained  i often have trouble recalling simple thing or word  sometimes word or sentence come out differently than how i intended  for example  i say something to my father  thinking it sounded fine  but he took it the wrong way  this happens a lot  with many different people  or  someone can ask me something very simple  but it take a little while for me to comprehend and respond or act  i cant do simple math in my head  some memory period of time in my life are completely missing  for example  i have absolutely zero recollection of learning how to do long division  rewatching the show supernatural a couple of year ago  and one early season felt like watching it for the first time  my mother and i watched it together before  there no way we would have missed those    amp  x   b    amp  x   b   i do weird thing  sometimes for attention reaction from people  sometimes just for me  example  making weird noise  burping very loudly  wearing something the wrong way intentionally  wearing a medical face mask like a bandana  licking my id  placing it on my forehead  and walking around doing thing normally  hoping that someone will see and giggle or think that im weird  sneezing very loudly or making myself sneeze because it feel good  i do a lot of the same old activity because theyre familiar  comfortable  and comforting  such a watching the same show and movie over and over because it easier than trying something new  whenever i have an appointment  i will always leave way earlier than i need to  even if i know i dont need extra time  often waiting in my car or around the area of topic  too scared from anxiety to go in super early before ive been asked to be there    amp  x   b    amp  x   b   i hold big grudge  i still harbor negative feeling for people who have wronged me even a long time ago  for example  a girl from     year ago who cheated and lied and hurt me  i dont harbor constant resentment or hate  but if i saw her  i wouldnt engage and would think  oh yeah  i dont like her  and then proceed to think about what happened  the people in the military who hurt me  i will never be able to forgive or let go of what they did for the rest of my life  unless somehow they reach out on their own and apologize  when i say i wont be able to let it go  that isnt to say a if i will be obsessing over the fact every day  but if something reminds me of one of them  i will remember    amp  x   b    amp  x   b   i can have drastic  unpredictable mood swing  today  i wa surprisingly in a good mood  while having some normal intrinsic thought of  this is weird  why are you in a good mood  yesterday you wanted to kill yourself   i had some good flower  and wa very relaxed and semi happy  not happy  per se  but not my more typical meh    and out spending time with my father and having a nice time  all of a sudden  my sister made a snide remark to me in a text  and it just set me off  now im very upset and this day fucking suck now  im taking time out of my day to write all this  im annoyed  and i will be spending the rest of the day alone  in my room  in the dark  and i may not eat again because my appetite is gone  if i force feed myself  then i am liable to throw up  my sister and i used to hate each other and went several year without speaking  we are now very close  we talk every single day and have for several year now  she know everything there is to know about me  so  she know that i am not well  and she know how to talk to me and how her word can affect me  she didnt need to make a rude comment  but she chose to  and i know this because i tried to address it  and she tried to change the subject  she used to be a mean girl bully  so she knew what she wa doing    amp  x   b    amp  x   b   my mood can either change rapidly like throughout the day  or i can be deep into them for day or week at a time  additionally  when i am happy  it more often than not just not sad  there have also been many time when i feel like i feel no emotion  for example  something that would usually make me upset  whatever  i dont care anymore  something would make me happy  meh  i dont feel sad  though  nor happy or anything else  just flat out nothing  everything feel muted  gray  blah  meh  food is just sustenance if i do eat  nothing interest me in that point at all  i may have just had an epiphany about why i dissociate sometimes  i start questioning my existence and doubting who i am  both in a sense of who i am a a person  and in the sense of is any of this real  i often find myself thinking that no  none of this is real  this is just the afterlife  or this is just a dream and im in a coma from my car accident    amp  x   b    amp  x   b   random  may be relevant  maybe not  i thought about asking one of my therapist  from a psych standpoint  how weird is it that i always put my sock on starting with the left foot  even if my right foot is closer  or it would be faster  or take le effort  i even have accidentally put a sock on the right first  and had to take it off and start over  i have done this for a long a i can remember    amp  x   b    amp  x   b   i get into argument with people close to me because i cannot stand being treated a wrong  or when people wont believe or accept correct information  it offends me and upset me to my core when i am trying to help someone that i deeply care about  and they reject my advice knowledge sentiment and go with the wrong decision        after they end up not heeding my word  something go wrong for them and they tell me they should have listened to me  example to this  i have extensive knowledge of subject that my friend have been recently getting into  such a camping  gun  first aid  and other thing that involve medicine physiology  there have been several time when were all discussing something  someone say something that is factually wrong  or something that i have already done and know the correct way to do  next  to the absolute best of my ability  i will calmly  and politely offer them the correct advice  or  i will just send a share a source with content proof  no word  just the proof  there have been so many time where after i do this  i am now the bad person  the other person get upset that i have to correct them  youre so annoying  you can never be wrong  next  i will say to myself  hey  they dont take your advice  even though they always come back and do it your way or apologize and say they shouldve  so maybe just stop offering up information  just let them be wrong  but  i cant  i aim to do this every time  i have successfully walked away from it a few time  but only a few  these people are my closest friend and family  i want the absolute best outcome and for them to get thing right and be happy  the first time  i have the purest intention  but it never go the way i think it will  im just trying to be nice and help  i dont understand    amp  x   b    amp  x   b   because of the military  i am now very paranoid with new people  i have to start off not trusting people  i cant be me around them until i have decided theyre an okay person  i always think people are out to get me and might try to use something i do or say against me  to get me in trouble or punish me in some way  i am absolutely mortified to the core from thinking of starting a new job  or returning to college because of this  i have my favorite people  my close family and friend  and am perfectly content with maintaining this and not getting new friend    amp  x   b    amp  x   b   i just  april  th of this year  got out of a     year relationship      of what i have done since then until now  still doing it  though le frequently   is pursue woman to have sex with  just sex  if it going to take more than one date to get there  i pas  day and night  a big chunk of my focus can be fixated on this  texting  snapchatting  messaging on tinder and bumble  sometimes around    or more girl at the same time  again  the focus of the conversation is always sex  or figuring out how to change the topic to sex if she hasnt already initiated it  in   month  i have racked up around    new partner  very rarely did the girl and i both have protection       were raw birth control       wa condom no bc or condom bc       wa nothing  had a few pregnancy scare  one abortion  my brain tell me to lie about this  but whats the point given this discussion  and two time of chlamydia or gonorrhea  i definitely had have alternating mood of this is so disgusting and unhealthy  im not even enjoying this anymore  why cant i stop in between my bout of gluttonous lust  but im still doing it nevertheless  there were several time when i had more than one new partner in the same week  i either did or almost did  had a new girl for all   day of the week a time or two  this wa a pretty big accomplishment for me and funny for me to tell my friend who were also living a very debauchery ridden lifestyle  i feel gross and dirty about that now    amp  x   b    amp  x   b   another possible bonus point  i mentioned that i wrote this while stoned  if i had not been high  or if i wa in one of my harrowingly depressed mood  i seriously  highly doubt i would have been able to write all this  whether that mean i doubt my motivation  my mental clarity  ability to articulate my thought properly  or be able to format this in a formal  understandable way  i just would have thought about it  said yeah  good idea  i should do that fuck it  i dont care    amp  x   b    amp  x   b   i am a male  id like to leave my age out for opsec to preserve what little anonymity i can with this many intimate detail  and to avoid any youre too old too young for x comment like when i argued with a full bird colonel patient of mine who told me  youre too young for back pain  you dont know what real pain is  after i went against my gut to let my guard down a little  put on my best patient care face  and tried to empathize with him    i wa in the military for   year  made great grade in high school  and had a         gpa my first two year of college before the military  i used to be extremely smart  happy  positive  fit  and in shape  from       mostly muscle  lifting weight     time a week  eating very healthy and eating a lot  to now       nearly all of my muscle gone  entirely sedentary minus walking light bodyweight exercise  and a bad diet  i dont eat junk food or unhealthy food  but i hardly eat compared to before  sometimes i cant eat from depression  or sometimes ill simply forget  right now  it  pm and im just now realizing i havent eaten today  i didnt mean to not eat  and im eating now and going to  try  to make sure i eat again before bed   happy  and healthy  now  i am an entirely different person  my parent hardly recognize me  i constantly get comment like  wow  you got so skinny   damn dude  whered all your muscle go   bro  why arent you like  huge anymore   wish i wa joking about the last one   i lost the     year relationship because of how i am now  i lost some very good friend because i cant act right  nearly every aspect of my life ha changed  something is wrong with me    amp  x   b    amp  x   b   very long tldr  i know im not right in the head  and have been and am currently seeking help in every form available  in and out of the military and now the va  i am trying  but i still like something is being missed  i have a lot of potentially weird potentially scary potentially very helpful for treatment thought feeling  do i share these or any of these with my doctor s   or not  and  could this in any way hurt disability    amp  x   b    amp  x   b   further additional detail that may or not be helpful    sometimes i dissociate    sometimes i get stuck on my phone or computer  for hour  hyper fixating and deeply researching reading into a subject  a reddit post  going down the rabbit hole several level of subreddits and link deep after starting from the main page  again  hour  ive accidentally stayed up doing this until  am multiple time in the past few week  i dont even realize the time passing  it feel like an instant  ive been typing this all out for nearly five hour now  i have not stopped or changed my focus to anything else  i tried to turn the tv on  but i only made it to turning on the power  and then it turned off from inactivity  i also do this while talking to people  people i deem a good people   or playing a video game  i also want to comment on a psychology term i wa told called flow or going in flow  meaning  if youre deeply ingrained into something  doe it make you forget about pain  for me  absolutely not     i play old school runescape  again  if you know  you know      someone can be talking to me and all of a sudden i realize im not paying attention at all  just going through a loop of listening to them speak and saying yeah  mhm  etc   even though im trying to pay attention  this happens a lot  my mind will either be wandering to different thing  or i wont be thinking about anything and i just simply cannot engage into conversation     same point a three above  i cant read book or the same exact thing for a very long time  even if i really enjoy it  like harry potter  i really want to  but either i do not have the mental emotional energy to read  or all i do is simply read the word without contemplating them or imagining whats going on  i did mention the getting stuck on reddit example  but that keep me engaged through clicking into many different subreddits or different article  i used to read avidly  i could read an entire book in one day  most recently  it took me nearly a year to finish a short  easy book my mom wanted me to read  it so embarrassing to even say that     branching from the last point  i feel like i am unable to picture thing in my head  is that normal  or is that ability what photographic memory mean  i will try to picture something in my head  and there nothing there  or it feel like im looking at a fuzzy image from very far away     i also cant really count in my head if doing anything else  for example  when seeing a patient  if were talking and they are doing something that requires counting  i cant do both  i sometimes would ask  and one time one of them told me that while we talking  in her head she could imagine a white board with number and it would change for her to keep track of her rep     i have hundred of tab reading list item on my phone  endless thing of thing i want to read about that  i want to watch that again  i want to buy that  i want to remember this for             etc    amp  x   b    amp  x   b   final final edit  i spent   hour on this  this wa the entire focus of my entire day    amp  x   b    amp  x   b   if you made it this so far  no matter if you comment or not and what you say  i want to genuinely thank you for taking your time out of your day to read my story  i truly appreciate it ,depression

762,interesting to notice the cultural rejection of the depressed  deep rest  state    if someone feel a deep inward  low energy state we say they are struggling with depression    perhaps they arent struggling at all  perhaps it is a restful moment of contemplation  in the same way that we all fall asleep each night  perhaps it a mini nap    we wouldnt say someone is struggling with needing     hour sleep a night    it speaks to me that we dont have an awareness within our culture that deep  dropped rest  away from the social mask  can be anything other than a hellish vortex that will suck u in and swallow u whole forever    we have culturally disconnected from the deep rest  creativity and replenishment that come from here    we program people to automatically fear it  to resist it  before they even know what theyre feeling  or what gift it might contain  they are reacting against it a taught by the culture  pushing against it  running from it  they assume they know what it is all about before even engaging with it    all the while perhaps it is just knocking on the door because it ha gift to share  gift from the deep  to reach them one cant just dip a toe in  but must immerse fully  be still for long enough for the cloudy water to settle    and then  what is revealed in that deep space can be surprising  deeply comforting and rejuvenating    deep creativity come from here  thing that can only be whispered and heard in the stillness of silence  we need to slow down to hear it  how will we hear our deepest inspiration if we only ever expect them to be loud and shrill enough to cut through the noise we have going on in our life    perhaps they would rather call u to their world  force u to slow down a little and break out of the daze we are running around in    perhaps they wont share their gift until we slow down to their speed   is it the emotion itself that cause trouble  or is it the whirlwind of fear and resistance we automatically unknowingly have in response to it  how early wa this state shamed by our environment when we were young  how many time were we told to cheer up  and silently disapproved of if we didnt   what kind of fraught relationship doe this cause u to have with the deeper  more still aspect of u  what internal critic and police guard have we taken on to police these state so that we are not rejected by those around u   how would it actually feel  and what value could these state bring if we were to drop all fear and resistance we have in response to them   what kind of journey or adventure might we have by coming directly into relationship with this place  to seek to know it rat her than flee from it  to seek to comfort and be comforted by it  rather than to judge  resist and push away   what secret await u down there  the great untapped resource of humanity ,depression
763,for context  apparently i am suffering from depression for the last couple  of year  i have been in denial  but my friend persuaded me to check  symptom so that i can see a therapist   i underwent a breakup during  this couple of year  and i m currently doing better  but definitely not  good   my worry and query is  is  there any hope at all whilst being this broken  i used to envision a  life  with goal  dream and aspiration  but right now after  considering the possibility that i might be a broken person  it is  making me worried if i will ever get to attain the life i envisioned   relationship for example  now that i know i might be broken  i simply  do not want to take effort to get into a relationship because that  would put the other person in an odd spot   i do not want that to happen  to anyone  i am highly inclined towards academia  but now i worry what  sort of productivity will i render while struggling with daily  motivation to keep pushing  is there any way i can pull my life back   and become not depressed once again   suicide ha never been my option  but it doesn t make life any le harder when  i have to fight the urge to be non existent every single day  i can be   and have been  very romantic  helpful  affectionate  and funny  and i  still am to my friend and family  but lately i have been using humor a  a coping mechanism more and more  i just need some hope  any hope  of  getting better  getting to make my life a bit more normal than it is  right now   i had have a  dysfunctional family of   where only my sister right now is the normal  one and i think not for long  i am a male of      cheer guy      i copy pasted this from my post in r depression to maximize reach  i hope this doesn t count a spam     ,depression

842,me and my partner have been together with each other for about   month now  we have no issue with each other or anything and we both are very close to each other  we are both minor still and go to different school and she ha strict parent  due to this we don t always get to see each other unless it a group  the problem isnt trust or not being around each other enough  the problem is i feel depressed without her  i know that sound like some love fantasy where one can t like without the other  but it is a serious problem  i feel down and suicidal and have outburst whenever im not in contact with her  it started recently  it s not her doing anything but i just don t think i should feel like that  i ve been depressed since i wa    which wa quite a time ago  i started to get suicidal and had a number of attempt  this wa due to a lot of pressure from school and parent and i had no outlet  my mom never paid any attention to me and wa always on fixed on her phone and smoke  my step dad wasnt required to give me any attention and i dont blame him for that  but i wa  beaten more than regularly and to the point of bleeding often  not with just a belt either  i wa choked and lifted onto wall and slammed into doorframe etc  i felt like my mom didnt care about it or anything  i wa never given any sort of reassurance and all the conversation i had with them were about how much i let them down and how disappointing it wa that i wasnt the best in my class anymore  i always heard of how lucky i wa to be provided with so much more than some others and that i squandered it  that went on for a couple of year where i stayed depressed and suicidal but i never once spoked to someone about it  nobody around me knew  i ended up being kicked out of my house   time and the longest time wa for   month  which wa last year june september  after this  my parent found a razor and mark on my arm  my step dad then of course beat me and blamed me for thing and saying how that could put him in jail for no reason and such  all the while my mom wa right there just on her phone  my mom told me that i should express myself a little and told me that a few time before so i then tried to do it  i said i couldn t say how i felt but i could write it  i then went for thirty minute in my room to show them how i felt and why i felt so  i showed them and they proceeded to laugh and say that i should just kill my self and they would go provide the blade for me to do so  after that i decided that i wa never going to tell another person how i felt  even though that wa my first time  then december   th      my grandfather passed  he wa the person i loved the most and the only one who felt like they cared and could be there  before my step dad i wa always with him for my entire life  he wa my father figure practically  he took me in when i got kicked out  i ended up not being able to do anything in school and started failing  the thing about my grandfather is that he wa a street boy his entire life  he wa always on the road doing something  and him being my only parental figure when i used to live with him before my step dad  i wa always with him  i cried hourly every single day because everything i saw reminded me of him  every single thing i did and saw and went to on a daily basis i had some memory of him  after a few month  it stopped  i stopped feeling sad and cry  i couldn t  i wa numb  i felt no sadness or care or anything  i felt no joy or happiness  i rarely felt it before but now it wa completely absent  then at around april june i met my girlfriend  i instantly liked her and wa attracted to her  in my entire life i had a total of   crush and wa attracted to them for only about a month  it wa really new to me  we spoke and met up and were doing great  i started to daydream about her and feel good when i thought about her and looked forward to talking to her every day  i started to feel emotion again  i started to feel happy  but the thing is  even though my emotion came back  the depression and sadness didn t come back  it wa like only the good and positive emotion came back  i wa extremely grateful and thought i had finally gotten over my half a decade of depression after thinking it would never happen  but recently  i ve been feeling sad  down again  drowning  it came back after about   month of being with her  the depression wa back to being normal  but it then grew  it got worse and worse and worse  i couldn t stand myself before with my depression  i couldn t stand anyone  i couldn t stand living  i didn t want to do it  but now it felt a if i wished i suffered  not emotionally  i wished i could ve rotted by myself  physically  i feel this way without her  i m not jealous of anyone or anything  but without her i can barely live  i have thought about just blocking her and the people i know who also know her  those people are my only friend  i wanted to do it because i didn t want to be annoying or anything like that  i feel like she deserves better  i ve thought about breaking up with her  but i dont want to hurt her  im head over heel for her  knowing that i hurt her would hurt me so deeply that i couldn t explain it  my biggest fear is losing her  i don t want to ever be away from her  it s contradicting  but i simply dont know what to do  she s the only person i ve loved anywhere close to my grandfather  i feel safe with her  i feel content and happy  but i simply dont know what i should do  i know i cant get mental help from a professional because of my parent  i thought about getting antidepressant but going into a pharmacy and asking would be too embarrassing  i don t know  i just wish i could die and disappear  i don t know how to tell her any of this  she s the only one i can ever be close enough to say something like this too  but for the past few day i ve been thinking about posting it on reddit  i hope i get some useful advice  every hour i ve been tempted and really considering blocking all of my friend and my gf  i hope i do  i hope i don t ,depression

845,hello  i wa diagnosed with depression over a decade ago and like many my journey ha been long  a consistent problem i am having trouble overcoming is of self sabotage   i am very good at it   i ll give you an example  friday morning i wa due at the office  i work in it which can be stressful  i woke to realise that i d been double booked for a couple of appointment  not a good start but hey ho  i had a client facing meeting to attend with a colleague whom had caused a lot of anxiety on a previous meeting because in short they were ill prepared  not my fault   the day prior i wa under pressure to make change to a client system which i had managed to sort without too much trouble  in the end  in the run up to xmas my anxiety and depression increase anyway with the influx of social situation that come up  so that wa on my mind   i realise in hindsight that all of these thing went into the boiling pot that is my brain and resulted in me shutting down on the morning in question and going back to bed  my coping mechanism when i feel overwhelmed ha always been to oversleep  overeat and avoid   i do exercise  but the biggest issue i have is  in the moment  self sabotage  first thing in the morning usually  i know i need to take responsibility and confront but i often feel avoidance is easier and take that route instead of doing the right thing   any advice  i do want to be better and this ha been a long term problem  year   counselling ha helped some but not this ,depression

862,about this time last year  i wa severely depressed  since then  i ve found a purpose  programming  it distracted me from how shitty i feel and i got reasonably good at it  to the point that i managed to land a software engineering internship with a large company  i envisioned myself rising up the rank in this company and eventually becoming a senior software engineer  i wanted it more than anything in the world  i wa feeling hopeful about my future for once   then i had a bad week  relapsed into depression all week  and prioritized a shady freelance project i wa doing on the side over this very promising internship  thought i had the situation under control  the internship wa almost over  and i d completed my final project  so i thought it would be a slow week     unfortunately  they decided i didn t contribute enough that week  which is true   and terminated me with no warning  well  there actually wa a warning  but it came about a month before that  about something totally unrelated  late submission     i know you must think  that s unfair  you shouldn t blame yourself   but i do  it wa always extremely competitive to land a job in this company  and other people simply deserve it more than i do  they re more reliable and le prone to depressive episode that take them out of commission for a week  for the duration of that internship  i deluded myself into thinking i wa someone that i am just not  and possibly could never be    it s just devastating when your depression win in the end  i made ton of progress over a few month  only for it all to be undone by a single bad week    i can t fucking code anymore without being reminded of this  if only i recovered before taking this opportunity   i am now reaching out to a psychologist  and i urge all of you who are still depressed to do the same    this is no way to live  i used to think i had functional depression  i could get a lot done in a good week  but when i really feel shitty  i ruin everything  or maybe it s my depression that ruin everything ,depression
863,i ve managed major depressive disorder for decade  i take medication  i exercise  i reach to people  i stay busy and i try to get enough sleep and be healthy   even though i can t stand what i do for a living  and i don t love where i live i still try to be positive and secondly  try to be neutral when positive feel fake because fake doesn t work for me     instead of faking it i ll simply say i m not doing really well today and it s just me  and if i m quiet that s why  then change the subject  this way people know what s going don t expect to be called upon for help but they also don t expect pollyanna sunshine when i want to run into traffic actually  that get really old and is super exhausting  it also mean that all of your friendship are based on inauthenticity and no one accepts you for who you are  that s no a great friendship model   there are a few people that i ve associated with for year who can t handle any form of depression and are straight up rude kind of like clique in high school where if you don t fit in you have to go or they will make it miserable for you  while i understand that not everybody can handle depression i feel like i ve been the most diplomatic person and these folk are taking advantage of anybody that is slightly different  they ve also been rude to people with small kid or a few folk that have a handicapp     how do you handle people that can t manage anything that isn t like them  particularly  if that person is entangled in a social circle you used to feel welcome in and they ruined the entire thing ,depression

877,  i m a weak person and society just isn t for me  i m affected way too much by anything that happens to me  no matter how much i try to change my negative thought they always come back    with my bpd i have massive change of emotion all the time and it s just not fun living like this  all of a sudden i ll remember that nobody ever liked me and i ll start to feel super down  it s just impossible  in a society where you have to move at a set pace  i don t have time to build myself up  i just have to keep going  a if nothing happened    my self confidence is at an all time low  like even in the worst moment of my life  at least i wa isolated so it wasn t that hard to delude myself into thinking that people s opinion don t matter  but now that i m back in school  i have to face those thing and i m just not strong enough to lie to myself and say  that s fine  one day someone will show love to me     even on that note  i fucking that part about me  is there littrrally nobody who like me   no i have a few friend and stuff but that s not enough  fuck this man  i wish i wa born in a poor position  at least by now i d have learned how to be satisfied of the simple pleasure of life    i get attached to others super easily  the hole i have in my chest is just too big  i need someone s support to fill it  every single girl that look at least ok  even if i met her just   min ago  i m already thinking  hum what would it be like if i wa in couple with her   that s how desperate my situation is  it s so sad  nobody will ever return the feeling of a weakling like me  the few that might are people who below my standard and i refuse to take their love  attention of whatever    nobody like me  i don t even try anymore  i know that it s not going to work and that it will cause me harm to be rejected for the   th time in my life    meanwhile everyone around me effortlessly get accepted  everyone around me ha a fucking girlfriend  the one that don t are either loser like me  which make it even more sad because it show that there really isn t a fucking way out of this for u  the other type of people  they don t have a girl friend now but i m telling you they re gonna get one soon  like i always see them flirting with a girl and it s clear that the girl s into him from their body language  they re gonna fucking within   week i m telling you  the other type of people and they piss me off even more cause there s a lot of em in my friend group  they re like  oh i don t want to have a boyfriend  like bro come on what the fuck is this bullshit  i m not saying they re wrong  they are absolutely right  codependent fuck like me are the one who are in the wrong but like this make my already hopeless situation even more sad  in a society like this where people put individuality on a pedestal  people like me who struggle without the support of others are fucking doomed   what frustrates me is just how much i don t have a single fucking opportunity a single fucking chance  like can you at least give me an opportunity  i d probably try my luck with a few girl  see that it s not that great and then get back to being alone  but the thing is i don t even get to choose  i just straight up don t have any opportunity  a i am right now  there ll never be a girl that i like who return my feeling and for good reason  who d want a person like me  clingy  weak  codependent  lazy  depressed  clearly none of my quality would ever compensate for that    the thing that frustrates me even more is that nobody know about that deep shit and i still get no opportunity  like that s how bad it is  even my tip of the iceberg isn t good enough  that one thing tho i don t understand  from a superficial point of view i don t see why anyone wouldn t want to be with me  like i m handsome  need to shave but appart from that it s good   i m funny  outgoing  when i feel good enough   etc    i don t feel accepted in my friend group  like i m well aware that asking for a partner would be just too much  but even a close friend who would support me isn t even within my reach  my entire friend group seems to be quite in shape and everyone feel accepted  but i don t feel the same way  this superficial thing fucking suck  i can t see myself talk about my problem to these people  the few that i ve tried don t really seem to care      what am i looking for   obviously a lot of it wa to get this off of my chest  but most importantly i m looking for a key  something to get me out of that dire situation  people usually say that thing like emotion and relationship etc cannot be understood by problem solving or thinking  from experience i highly disagree    there is always a solution that can be formulated a a strategy even in something more vague like emotion  what i want with this post are people who can give me the clue to those thing    what i don t want are people saying  ah but you re not alone in this  everytime i ve ever heard that i want to punch the person  like bro honestly  saying this make it even worse  not only are you not helping  you re making me realize that thousand of other people are living this same thing yet nobody help u  that make my view of society even worse thanks    same for people who will just say  ah it s sad  or something like that  look i know you have good intention but it really doesn t help  so if you don t really have anything constructive to say  saying nothing would be better  i fucking hate my life right now and i d take anything but empty answer ,depression

893, to contextualize thing i have to say that i am a lucky person  with a good family  friend and so on  my life doe not present problem or misfortune that make it impossible for me to live it  however there are no reason to live it either   for a long time i feel that my life is empty  i study law to try to get a good job  i love thing like the internet and writing  i play sport  and i m moderately attractive  however all this ha lost value for me  since i wa little i lived my life wanting to be the pride of my family  to be a father  to find love  among other thing  however  for some time a deep depression ha ravaged my being  i have been unable to express myself a i truly am  fortunately or unfortunately  my twisted sense of humor make all my loved one think that i am a self confident person  charismatic  funny and cheerful  but nothing is further from the truth   for a long time i have felt disappointment towards every aspect of life  of society  of the world  i want to do different thing with my life  but either i don t have the courage to do what is necessary  or i am prevented from doing it for reason over which i have no control  when i think about life  i compare it to that video game that you like so little  that you don t expect anything from it and that you stop playing  that series that you can t get hooked on and that you stop watching  the reason i don t take my own life is because i love my loved one  most of them have been through quite a bit of real drama in their life and now  luckily  they are happy  the reason why i pretend and try to move on is so that they don t suffer because of me  so that my selfishness doesn t put an end to that happiness that they have worked so hard to achieve   i can t take it anymore  i m tired of this status quo from which i can t escape  my life ha become a string of disappointment  one after another  the loss of any hope for tomorrow or the day to day  to meet people or to do thing  to create a family or to find love  the truth is that the reason for this post is to see if there are more people like me  or people who have gone through it and have managed to move on   thanks in advance ,depression

934,i ve noticed for a while now  but never knew who i could tell without getting a negative reaction  that i never seem capable of any good or caring emotion  i m capable of feeling sad for sure  just thinking about this alone make me sad and even a little angry at myself   when i watch a movie and something sad happens  theoden losing his son in lotr  i m aware that it s a sad scene for sure  but i just have no emotional reaction to it  i try to force myself to cry because i feel like that s how i should be reacting  but i haven t genuinely been able to cry for sadness since i wa little   and that s basically what i do all the time  i know how i m supposed to feel about different thing and i try to force myself to feel them and i just don t  i still have fun and laugh on my better day but rarely  most of the time i m seeing people having fun and laughing and just not comprehending why   it s even gotten to where  i know i care about my daughter and do everything i can to take care of her and let her be able to have fun  but i feel like i m not quite emotionally connected to her like a parent should be  and god know where her mother is  so she doesn t have that option ,depression
935,my family is upset with me because i have no motivation and do not have a future planned  if i don t even feel anything  how am i supposed to look forward to the future   according to them   actually doing something for once  will help me  when i help or do thing that should make ne happy  they do not  if they do  it is fleeting  how do i fix this  it make it hard to have positive routine or goal ,depression

939,it s crazy  when you re actually looking for help  no one notice that anything s wrong  but then when you re feeling ok  people feel like there s something off   i worked on august    a year since i wa hospitalised after a paracetamol overdose  i hardly slept that night  and overdosed again  no one seemed to care   however  other day  i have had a number of customer say thing like    gt are you working from home  you sound like you just got out of bed   i wa just going through a routine call and one of my customer said    gt well  whatever s bothering you  i hope it get better soon   yeah  i hope so too  she didn t say that in a genuine way  she just meant i sounded depressed  my manager ha criticised me for having a  flat tone of voice   she listened to one of my call  the first call on a saturday morning    gt you sound like you re half asleep   what the fuck doe that even mean  apparently it s completely subjective  and it doesn t mean i m not engaged and prepared  or doing my fucking job ,depression
940,i dont know if im just depressed or what  but ill go through period where i feel like isolating myself  i dont know why  it not that i dont care about my friend and family  i love them  and they are all great people  but for example  when i left for college  i just wanted to leave and not talk to anyone for a while  it like my brain forgot the importance and value of good relationship  and i feel like i forgot the good time i had with them  ive heard that depression can cause memory loss  so that could be it maybe   it bother me a lot because we dont live forever  and i dont want to miss out on moment with my friend and family  i also dont want to be neglectful to them  or make them feel like i dont love them    ive also found that you start to go a bit crazy without social interaction  because i havent had a much a a result   so idk what the deal is  i feel like being completely alone for whatever reason  but it seems like that suck too  because it very boring   ive been seeing a counselor from my college  but i dont get to see her very often  also  i tried ssri briefly  i planned on not taking them for the rest of my life  and i wa scared because they made me think differently and make decision that i wouldnt have made if i hadnt been on them  and i wa afraid that when i stopped taking them i would regret my life choice and find that my whole life wa a lie because i wa compelled by the drug to make those decision  i may have to go back on them though because im pretty sure i also have ocd and thing are getting rough these day ,depression
941,i    f  have struggled with severe depression  anxiety and loneliness my whole life  therapy scare me because obviously the anxiety but i also feel like i technically have no real reason to be this down so it feel wrong to seek help   i wa always told  youre too pretty to be depressed  and it just got swept under the rug so i eventually stopped telling anyone about it  the relationship in my life all seem very circumstantial  my family only come to me when they need money  dating culture is absolutely terrible and my friend only want to party and drink  it doesnt feel like anyone care and i just want to feel normal for once  it so incredibly exhausting waking up every day and living with the same draining thought   i just need to know  doe it ever actually get better ,depression
942,very well i do not want to start talking a if i myself were recovered but if i can give a grain of sand at the same time to work my mentality are two bird with one stone  the medicine stopped working for me a long time ago  i also gave up therapy and i don t have many friend it honestly seems like i just get used to the pain and maybe i do  it s not like i haven t had suicidal thought i ve just decided flatly that i don t want to die  i want to live and the truth is that all of u who are here want the same thing  no matter how much we tell ourselves that we want to die we do not do it because we have hope that something or someone will save u but you know what  not all of u will be saved  not all of u are lucky and i bet only   in    of u will have that luck  we have to take the bull by the horn and fight  i m going to tell you something that maybe not everyone ha noticed but it is worth keeping in mind and that is that before sadness there wa anger  anger towards ourselves or those who repress u  take back that anger and not in a bad way  the enemy is one and it is our own head  get up  it doesn t matter that it s screaming and gritting his teeth  get up no matter if you bite your lip until you draw blood  no matter that your body scream in pain get up  remember your anger  remember who you were before you were here  even though many of u are like this almost from the beginning of our life there wa a time when we were strong  aim for that  the harder it is  the stronger your fist  the harder you shout and the harder you fight  there is something that all of u can do and that is to force ourselves to fulfill our dream  if you must start fulfilling your dream of    year ago and make a plasticine doll do it but do something  remember who you were and if you don t have that kind of past then aim for the future  who do you want to be  it sound hard or shitty but it work only if you try  im getting up that way  i still have a long road ahead but ill keep striving  even if this is just a punch of lie  ill keep striving to become my perfect me  i hope you will do the same ,depression

1005,sorry  long post incoming   i     m  been dealing with depression like symptom  undiagnosed  since i wa a teenager  like many   but a bit deeper than most of my peer  went to community college and then university  but quickly dropped out of the latter because of depression  having to wake up early for a morning class  never been a morning person  so once i slept in and missed that first biology class  then it became more and more common  then i stopped going to all of them altogether   and just feeling lost in general   like i couldn t see the end goal nor see myself getting there   i went back home  and my mom wa very upset at first because i hadn t really talked to her about the situation until she got the phone call from the school  but after a week or so of cooling down  she wa supportive again  i wa so down and ashamed that i didn t do anything for a while   i d stay locked up in my room and only come out at night to eat  so it could literally be day in between sighting of me  after about a year of that i started working again   mainly at domino s  delivery driver  i liked the driving part of the job but not the rest and i wa almost always late because i would sleep up until half an hour before the shift  worked night    i quit and returned to that job around     time because of a like hate relationship with my immature manager  until one day i got another facebook message from a marine recruiter who i d turned down a couple year ago  seemed like a sign and i really  really wanted to move forward with something positive  so i went   but i ended up talking with the army recruiter instead   i wa very quick to go through with the process  which surprised my mom since she did it too when she wa younger and whenever she asked if i ever thought about joining myself  i would say no  benefit  stability  learning personal skill  low living expense  and most of all  not burdening my family by sitting at home doing nothing sounded perfect    all i had to do wa keep my head down  shut myself off  and do what i wa told    swearing in wa probably the biggest mistake i ve ever made  i even cried before i signed the contract  basic training wa a struggle  the longest   month of my life  but no matter how i tried  they wouldn t let me out   fast forward to now    year in and   year to go  most would probably think  surely i ve adapted by now  i haven t  i still show up late every day  still miserable  still have spending problem and sleeping problem  still trying to get myself out  and despite dozen of visit with mental health provider  no change  or if there is  it s very short lived and i m back down in the dump after a few day  so i m tired of even talking about it when it get me nowhere  i have one of the easiest job in the army and even when we re not doing this job  the rest of the thing we re doing are simple and easy too   except for me  when i still have trouble even getting out of bed every morning to slave away for an organization that i don t even feel attached to    i just really feel like giving up at this point  i ve always been told  and i don t always agree  that i m so smart and i have so much potential  yet i ve completely fucked myself over more than once and am possibly in the process of doing so again because even if i do manage to get out early  it might be a general discharge instead of an honorable one  basically determining whether i get benefit or no  and a i m typing this i wa supposed to be somewhere this morning and i just couldn t bring myself to walk out the door    i ve always wanted to be    somebody  or at least have the mean to support myself on my own term but i ve made zero progress towards that over the past few year  and at this point  i feel like i ll never be anything more than a mediocre bum and that i don t have anything to live for   if anyone at all ha any thought  any suggestion  any insight  question  anything    hit me ,depression

1007,for the longest time i ve just felt like i literally don t belong here  not like  i believe i m an alien  or whatever but more like i feel like existence in general just isn t for me  i have thing that i enjoy doing and i m actually doing quite well at the moment  but i fundamentally do not enjoy life and what being alive mean    i don t fit in with societal norm  i have very few friend that i actually can vibe with and the thought of just functioning a a normal human being for the next       year scare the fuck out of me  life in general actually terrifies me    i don t think i really wanna kill myself or something  but if i had the option to just press a button and just no longer exist  i would press it without any doubt at all  i don t see it so much a death  more like an exit or an end to the mundanity,depression

1011, i used to wake up every morning genuinely happy and honestly thought that i wa living the perfect life  that i could repeat the same day over and over for the rest of my life and be happy  i had a supporting family  lot of friend  a good job and engaging hobby  then a number of thing happened     first my work shut down my local branch and relocated me to another city on a fly in fly out roster     i then moved permanently to this city to pursue my career and because my partner wanted to live here     after moving i became extremely homesick  and felt extremely isolated from my friend and family  hobby and culture     the first   month of living in the city  all i wanted wa to return home and go back to the way life used to be  but when i went back for christmas i found my attitude changed  going back wasn t the answer  and most of my friend had already left  at this point i felt extremely hopeless and fell into a huge depression that i masked with video game and alcohol  i also withdrew from everyone which put a huge strain on my relationship     my partner then emotionally cheated on me  and left me right at the end of our lease  moving in with the guy and ended up marrying him and having a kid with him     this left me completely alone in a city where i knew no one  forced me to send my dog back home to my parent  put all my possession into storage and i moved into student accommodation due to the rental crisis     after a year and a half i managed to secure a new house to rent with a roommate  i thought getting my own space and thing back would help  but most day i still feel lonely and sad  it s been two year but i m still struggling to get over my breakup  i exercise  eat and try to sleep well  but i have very little social life  really all i do is work  gym and chore  i honestly don t see a way out of this situation  i have little hope for my future and spend most day just trying to get by    i can still feel happiness and joy  but these usually come from hobby such a hitting a pr at the gym  enjoying a new game  and the odd occasion i get to go socialize  but the ordinary part of life have me feeling empty  sad or lonely most of the time  this cause me to try and stay occupied at all time and i often have trouble falling asleep due to my thought running wild  usually i ll watch tv till i pas out    i don t know if i m depressed and should seek help or my feeling are a symptom of my life and i need to make drastic change  but i honestly have little hope for the future either way  ,depression

1021,i saw this info in an article  passed along by someone who ha experienced crippling depression  the client got it from a therapist  and i thought it wa great encouragement for anyone who is having trouble functioning due to severe depression    my psychologist told me that learning new skill and knowledge or establishing a new habit creates new neural pathway in your brain  it s like hacking your way through a jungle  it take a lot of time  effort  and energy to reach your destination  or achieve your goal   but every time you practice that skill or follow that habit  you reinforce that neural pathway  a it s reinforced  it becomes easier to fire up those neuron again  making it easier to do the act or behavior  the jungle is still dense  but it becomes easier to follow the same path that you created yesterday  and every time you take that path it becomes a little more clear  eventually the behavior may become so automatic that it requires no effort at all  this analogy ha helped me quit smoking  study for exam  and establish a walking routine when i wa too depressed to move  ,depression

1023,i might a well cut to the chase  i wa diagnosed with type   diabetes out of the blue in june  no symptom beforehand  that i noticed   no family history  no reason to suspect i had a hidden chronic illness  it s a long story but basically the  treatment  for the disease  giving myself shot multiple time a day  is quite literally the worst thing that s ever happened to me and i hate myself and my life so much that i just want out of this life  i am sorry if i sound like i m being dramatic but suddenly having a lifelong condition and drastic life change and already being near phobic of shot  i ve gotten to the point where i can give myself the shot now  but the anxiety and depression is worse than ever  is a lot  while my mental health wasn t   great   before  i wouldn t say i wa depressed so my mental health problem are directly related to the diagnosis of t d  so incredibly situational  but the situation isn t going away  i don t want to jump to med right off the bat especially because of how hard it is to find an antidepressant that would reliably work for me  but i wanted to know if med could possibly help situational depression  a opposed to depression that wasn t caused by a specific event where the cause is unknown biochemical  it s okay if the answer is no  i would rather know the truth than think there might be something out there that would help that i haven t tried ,depression

1090,i should preface this with some key background info  sorry it s kinda a lot of info but context is necessary   i   f  made a move on my friend   f  a month ago  i had come to term with the fact that i had feeling for her after feeling that way for year and pushing it away  a few year ago  she had confessed that she had feeling for me in the past  after i made a move and confessed that i had feeling for her  it wa a month of u hanging out periodically  we were both very busy with school  sport and college apps  and talking  for a week or so  i didn t see her outside of school and had immense anxiety about where we stood  at the end of this week  we were at a small halloween get together with alcohol involved and in the early morning hour  i told her i loved her  ik it wa a terrible idea in hindsight but i wa also still a bit drunk  and she said it back  a few day later  she broke it off  saying that she realized she had no romantic feeling for me    naturally  i have had a very hard time coming to term with this  i am doubting my ability to distinguish between romantic and platonic action now bc she initiated stuff like hand holding and physical touch even when we were both sober    before this all happened  i had the thought that i wa very close to death  like if i died tomorrow  i would be perfectly at peace with that  post breakup  those passive suicidal thought have been more prevalent and turned into fantasy  fantasy of she and i drinking poison and dying in each other s arm  or hit by a car  i also feel very alone even when i m with people and just generally depressed  loss of appetite  passion  interest in planning my future  etc    my question is  do i need to seek help for this  i know i am depressed but it s not like i m contemplating suicide  i also don t know if the fact that this is situational change thing  while i felt at peace with death before this  it s not like i wa really having fantasy of dying and the breakup what triggered those  so do i need to seek help or just wait it out ,depression

1166,im miserable at work  everything i do to help people out that isnt even my job is unappreciated and i get blamed for anything that doesnt go right  ive been doing this job for    month and the boss still dont believe im competent in doing simple task correctly when the real issue ha nothing to do with me  they wont listen to any of my suggestion to help fix simple problem so ive just stopped bringing thing up because i know i wont be heard  im deciding to only do the minimum work thats assigned to me and let them figure out problem on their own  im done trying  i simply give up    husband would rather spend all day coding an app on his computer just for fun than spend time with me during the short time that one of u isnt at work or already asleep for the next day  i work  am  pm mwf and  am   am t th  he work  pm    pm  his car is broken but is technically still useable and he is expecting me to drop everything and leave work during my lunch break to take him to work at   and then pick him up at   pm when i have to be awake at     am later in the same night  he called me manipulative earlier because i asked why i should sacrifice my break and sleep for him to drive him to work when he wont even do something a simple a spend time with me   i have begged him so many time to just pause what he doing on the computer and just spend even    minute hanging out with me to watch tiktoks and cuddle  thats the only thing that actually seems to calm me down and make me feel better  i am feeling so much that i am le important to him than a fucking computer  the person who is supposed to love me the most is making me feel so unappreciated  abandoned  and so fucking lonely all the time   because of everything ive been so depressed that i havent done any of my school work the past   week  i simply have no motivation to do anything because it all really doesnt matter in the end  im just going to drop out of my master program and give up like a fucking loser    i honestly dont know what ha happened to me  i used to be that strong bitch who didnt care about anyone or anything and would speak my mind and do whats best for me  people started to not like me because of that attitude that didnt benefit them in any way  so over time i have become such a weak person who let people step all over me    ive also been sick with some unknown stomach problem thats making me vomit multiple time a week and have severe nausea for day on end  my insurance ha refused to cover an endoscopy until i prove ive tried at least     other thing  my procedure wa supposed to be tomorrow but yet again insurance denied covering it until i go to a follow up appointment  this doctor ha a     month wait time so every time thing get rescheduled i have to wait so long for the next opening  ive been miserably sick since june  i literally cannot take it anymore  i just want to die so badly so i dont feel like shit every day    i hate my life  i hate being here  i didnt ask to be on this earth  i wish i would just drop dead out of nowhere or get killed in a car crash or something so i dont have to keep living every single day like this  the only thing keeping me here is my dog and she is    so i wont have a reason to be here after she dy,depression

1168,hello  the first thing i want to say is that i hope with all my heart that those who are going through depression can be better  sorry if my english is not good  i just want to post this a a way of undoing because i feel lost in life but i am far from having depression so i apologize for writing this post   to give context i am a college student     year old male  i always had good grade in high school more out of self imposed pressure than anything else  the truth is that i learned since i started high school that life is unfair  all those hour studying were for nothing  i missed out on a lot of thing and i didn t get even    of what the other student with lower grade got  to say that it is not their fault that they have a better economic background  good grade didn t even give me any advantage for college  being in good or bad grade wa the same thing  although my mom wouldn t be too happy if my performance dropped    somehow i managed to have friend  but i always debate whether to leave them or not  i know that if i leave they form an even better group  i feel that i don t fit in with them  they have very good chemistry with each other  i only hang out with them when it s someone s birthday  i would like to go out with them at other time  but i don t dare ask them  some of them hang out together sometimes and when i see their instagram story it make me happy for them  i don t know them  i don t know anything about their life and they don t know anything about mine  i don t trust them  i know they are good people but i am simply unable to trust them  but  at the same time  if i leave i will be alone and i will lose those little moment that made me feel something more than just sadness or apathy  i already experienced that in the pandemic and i almost went crazy   sometimes i also think about how it would feel to have a girlfriend  but then i remember how i am emotionally and i know i shouldn t have one right now  plus i m ugly and low self esteem so i wouldn t be able to bring much to a relationship either hahaha   then i have my family  my mom and grandmother   i appreciate them very much for the thing they did for me  but i have a very big internal hatred for them and it hurt me  i think a lot of time about working  going somewhere else and if possible losing all contact with them  they are the kind of extreme personality i don t want in my life  one person who care about the organization and is always angry when she see the politics of my country and my mother who if i contradict her on something already get angry and the same if i don t answer a whatsapp message fast or if i don t answer a message the way she want  not just tell her okey  yes  etc    again i say  i know they are people who love me because i know  they never hit me  yes we had our fight but nothing too serious  i just want to block them and that they can t contact me by any mean   coming to college i try hard to have good grade but i realized that it doesn t do me any good to have good grade   again  i won t get anything from the university  it doesn t help me to look for a job  it doesn t help me if i want to travel to another country  so   why make the effort  i feel like i m only doing it because repeating the course would be wasting more year of my life  at the moment i am going to drop one of the subject in order to study for the exam and do the work of two other subject  on this path i only got stress and anger with myself   that made me think about my future  currently i know nothing  no technical or social skill  in a country with an unstable economy with      inflation  zero desire to continue with the university  with no desire or desire for anything  i also admit that this year i exceeded in the amount of subject i did compared to the previous year and that may have influenced perhaps   i can t contribute anything to any job because i focus on college  i can t enjoy walking a i used to or going out with friend  i can t even rest without having the constant worry that i have to pas my subject to   have a better life or job    i had to quit the gym for more than a month too and i started to gain weight again  i feel like i am running against time and especially against my country because thing will only get worse  i m exhausted  i wish it would destroy me or stop already but those   option will never happen   the only thing that keep me from committing suicide is that i don t have the ball and i know that deep inside i want to enjoy life  i don t drink alcohol or do drug or smoke because i want to stay alive a long a possible  but at the same time i don t mind dying  but if i didn t mind dying i wouldn t do what i do to stay alive  i want to seek professional help but i don t have the money  on top of that i won t have a vacation to study a summer subject   i always like to think of the phrase from cast away   and i know what i have to do now  i gotta keep breathing  because tomorrow  the sun will rise  who know what the tide could bring    ,depression

1178,so after a series of event which tested my patience  will to live and pain tolerance level  it is safe to say that my life is officially ruined    first my parent made me choose subject that they wanted me to study  and despite my protest  and endless attempt at convincing them including an hour long ppt  i wa threatened to be pulled out of school and my mom even shouted at me in front of my friend  they still deny this to date so gaslighting ultrapromax   then my college major wa chosen when there wa peak c vid  and i wanted to do psychology  but they told me that i would be jobless and begging on the street  i initially liked my degree but burnt out really fast and have been since then  i have severe anxiety  depression and adhd  and my parent snatched my med last year when they found out  which worsened my burn out  our academic calender wa chef s kiss where we functioned without a day s break for     year  i m about to finish this degree in   month and i don t know if i m interested in this field or not  i have always wanted to do psych and now my parent are like we allow but it too late  i have breakdown everyday and because of my adhd i take so much more time than others in completing task that by the time i m done with half a task  all my energy is exhausted  i have reached a point where i am having pounding chest pain everytime i wake up  and i just randomly breakdown at any time of the day  seeing everyone thrive in their field while i m barely able to keep myself alive  just make everything worse   a month ago i yelled at them for making my entire life a grand mess and what ensued wa a screaming battle for an hour  where everyone kept cry  i have become someone i can t even recognize  i scream at my parent at the slightest of discomfort  i get irritated easily  i throw thing when i m by myself and lately i have been having thought to just end it instead of suffering through the pain   what to do  i m afraid if i drop this degree  then i d be subject to a lifetime of taunt and mockery and what if i get burnt out there too  but at the same time pulling through   month of this degree is giving me   th grade flashback where i counted day and just broke down till i reached the end  and this is a red flag that maybe this profession isn t for me   my physical health is a reflection of my mental state  i cant even sit and meditate for   minute because i get so jittery that i end up puking  i randomly get dizzy  throw up  have intense back pain  sprain that appear out of nowhere and get fever also frequently  at college i have had multiple breakdown and being an all rounder  i just cannot recognize who am i even becoming    amp  x   b   what to do  how do i recover from this burn out  how do i get my career back on track  how do i prevent getting burnt out  should i drop out ,depression

1186,i m so depressed  i hardly have any will to live  and i m doing very little with what i have  i wa supposed to go look for job today  i smoke weed though  so i wa going to find some cheap fake urine to use for a drug screen  it took me a few hour to get ready  because i woke up very anxious today  i do every day  some day are worse than others  today wa a worse day  i hoped that a shower and a fresh outfit would kick my as into gear  but it didn t  i didn t even bother to put on fresh clothes  i went into town  and of course  everywhere is out of the fake urine i m looking for  i can t afford what else is available  half of the place i went were closed  i had a mini pity party because nothing wa going my way  i didn t have it in me to go try to get job anyway  a lot of place around here don t care about weed showing up in a drug screen  i very well could have gotten one  but it s like i had already decided i wasn t going to try anymore for the day  even though i wanted to  i know the quicker i find work  the le stress i ll have   i live  with  my mom and stepdad and younger sister  i actually live in a little shed turned tiny house behind her house  i m allowed to enter through the back door to use the bathroom  the way the house is set up  it doesnt inconvenience them too much for me to do that  i pay them     a month to stay here  and i moved here about four month ago  my parent are the type of people that treat people who aren t working a le than  i haven t told them that i just quit my job  i know i should have gotten a new one first  sometimes i m so impulsive  i can t even talk myself out of a self sabotaging situation   even when i m working  i struggle with my relationship with my mother  i grew up wondering if she even loved me  yes  i had clothes  food  i got what i wanted for birthday and christmas  and i m grateful for those thing  especially now that i ve been out on my own and understand what it take to earn enough money to do all of that consistently  all by herself  she wa always pretty withdrawn when my sister and i were child  she never played with u  or tried to teach u anything  she would get mad at u if we didn t just know how to do something  but would never show u how to do what she wanted u to do  would not try to let u understand before she blew up  she wa more forgiving with my sister because she ha a learning disability and needed extra medical attention a a young child  she never ha and still doesn t tell me she love me  she never want to hug me  she doesnt listen when i speak to her  it s gotten better though  she used to completely ignore me and act like she didn t want me around  she s very rude and hypocritical  she s racist but doesn t think she is  race and politics are big trigger between u  i dont like to talk about it  but it s all she want to talk about  hateful  ignorant  political nonsense  that s gotten better too  i have to shut it down sometimes  she think i m stupid because i don t hate people who aren t white  most of our interaction is her telling me what i m doing wrong or did wrong  and i still hurt over a lot of thing she said in the past when i wa a kid  like how she hope for my sake i m a lesbian  she laughed when her roommate asked if i should have been born a boy  i have pcos and pretty much every symptom that come with it   and when i worked with her for a while  she said that another girl we worked with wa like the daughter she never had  she s smiling  she look at me  she said it in front of all our coworkers  and they all knew i wa her daughter  man that still fucking hurt  it wa also humiliating   i got out of a bad relationship that lasted six year  and wa drowning in my bill  working    hour shift to pay for a piece of shit trailer i hardly had time to live in  she bought a shed that had a lot of the work done  and told me i could live in it  it s nice  it wa cool in the summer and it s very warm in the winter  it s like a cozy little dorm room  she even hooked me up with my own wifi  i have everything i need  and it took many stress off of me  i m extremely grateful  it wa completely unexpected and unlike her  and honestly  now i m wondering if it wa a mistake  i have more freedom than i did before  but i feel those clutch coming down  i m trying not to take it personally  i m sure it ha more to do with her than it ever did with me  i see my friend relationship with their parent and it s so vastly different than what i experience  i wish i had that with my parent   i don t regularly speak to my real dad  if i see him  we talk  and that s it  i don t speak with anyone else in my family  they only treat me like a failure too  and they have a lot to say even though they dont know anything about me other than i m their sister daughter   i love my friend but i m beginning to isolate myself a bit  i feel like an asshole most of the time  i don t do anything substantial with my freetime  i m too anxious to leave the house for anything unnecessary anyway  at the house  i just hang around and wonder what i m going to do  and do nothing all day  a lot of time  i think about dying  i do not have any will to harm myself  i just

1199,i   f have been dealing with depression for the longest time now and i feel like every day i m going further down the spiral  i m unable to focus on college  i don t eat properly and feel like many thing thing that happen around me and are our of my control  send me straight to bed for day  for instance  people s behavior towards me  which is what triggered my last  breakdown  and the reason i m seeking guidance here   i felt completely ignored  by someone i met again after some time of talking and texting  we shared very intimate conversation and i thought it could potentially become a something  but he ended up getting a girlfriend    it hurt  but i got over it since the time we talked wa fairly short   we still kept in touch and shared mostly friendly conversation  although he still kept showing interest in me and even flirting    he invited me to a party not so long ago  to which i attended only because i would meet some people there i knew through him  i have been isolating myself for so long that i got excited about meeting these people  i knew it could be awkward seeing the guy after everything what happened and also cause his gf would be there  but i never expected it to be so bad  he couldn t look me in the eye when talking in the group  whatever i said  he completely ignored and if i said anything to him  he wouldn t answer or would say something coldly    this behavior hurt me the most  specially because he wa the only ome i knew personally in that group everyone else i just knew from online game  i wa so shocked and incredibly embarrassed  i felt dumb for even saying anything or being there  i wanted to leave    after a while  i decided to focus on the rest of the people and thankfully ended up having a good time with them  but the whole thing stuck with me for the rest of the week  i feel sad because i still can t comprehend why someone would act so rude and mean      why would something like this happen  it wa the first time i ever shared intimacy with someone  it wa the first time i decided to be more open to others and all i got from it wa neglect and embarrassment  i have never been person who would have any kind of resentment towards others  so i thought being friend aftee what happened would work  also because we shared a lot of interest      the group want to do more stuff together  but i feel like an alien there now  although they were so nice and fun      i ve been troubled since then  i can t think of anything else  i ve cried in embarrassment and in anger  i would like to just delete him from my mind and get on with my life and have fun with the guy  but the at night keep l repeating itself      how can i avoid being so affected by thing like this  i can t control his behavior  so how can i control my reaction to it  it s very exhausting  i just wish i could be more confident and just ignore everything that happened and get on with my life  ,depression

1234,i know that it might sound like a basic depressed person story  but it is what it is  by the way  two year ago i used to be that perfect kid that would study all day  help their parent  self improve and etc   i always want to sleep  but no matter how much i sleep  i fall asleep everywhere  at home  at school  etc  school is literally my life  but not because i m obsessed with it  i m simply not interestedly in any other thing and don t have energy for them  so it s the only thing that i force myself to do to not end up homeless in the middle of the street  i also have ocd  but it hit from time to time  i have anxiety  but it s mostly associated with studying  everytime i start to think about completing even a little task  that s when the panic start  i can t even read the theory to complete the practical part  because my head start to feel like a mess and i m holding myself from cry and screaming  when i complete the task and i have at least a little problem  i simply closed everything and go away  because it s extremely stressful to go through the panic and search up  for example  information in the internet that would help me to complete that task  i don t know what s the point of my life  if i just don t do anything not to panic  but i m still panicking and am always sad   i ve been taken to the psychiatrist recently  and she told my parent that everything s really bad and i m really close to getting in the mental hospital  that give you a paper that won t let me get employed during all my life  but she told them that there s a chance that something will help  so she told me to take antidepressant and specific injection to maintain a blood circulation in the brain or something like this  those pill make me want to sleep even more  and everytime i actually sleep during the day and wake up  i have extreme panic attack because it s always too late and i have a lot of homework to do  that psychiatrist told me to visit a psychologist  physiologist told me that everything is not that bad  but i don t think she understands  she think that i m simply s nerdy person and the reason of all my problem is that i prioritize school too much  and she told me to do new thing  such a running  listening to music  reading and etc  but a i ve just said  i can t get myself to care about these thing  and i just want to go back to bed  so i definitely don t just  prioritize school too much    anyways  i m graduating from highschool in le than two year  and if i don t pas the exam  then my life will be broken in piece and i ll be taken to the army  i don t even know who i want to become  because  again  nothing interest me  i m stressing over a simple homework  plus i have so much unnecessary subject homework  that i don t have any time to prepare for the subject that will be on the exam and my school doesn t prepare u at all  i just don t know know what to do and what is even the point of my existence  constantly laying down  barely studying  eating my parent  food and living on their money  well  i don t really want to do that but the wall of the mental struggle is too hard to break  especially when all those thing were going on for more than a year now   i m so afraid of the future and i don t know what to do ,depression

1238,like you dont feel sad  you dont feel angry  you dont feel hopeless or hopeful  you just dont feel anything at all  is this still considered depression  ive gone through some very difficult thing for my mentality in the last   year and for some reason lately ive felt just numb to sadness or guilt or really a care for anything  i do still have some energy to do thing i enjoy alone and go to work  i talk to loved one once in a while but no desire for anything else and not extreme emotion   is this still considered depression ,depression
1239, maybe im selfish  i keep telling myself im selfish  but then the only thing i find motivation to do are thing for others lately  anything to do with me for me  hell just holding people up to go to the bathroom  i actively avoid the best i can  it gotten to the point where thing i used to do that were easy seem like climbing a mountain  it not just doing my own laundry anymore  or taking a shower for myself  it the small thing  like brushing my hair  or making a meal  my makeup  changing clothes  i dont like when i make my own meal anymore  why  because if i do them theyll just end up with whatever i can find like a protein bar and a banana  even though i could cook some pasta if i really wanted and thats what i want  i know it not worth it   even if thats just plating a dish and putting it in the microwave sometimes thats too much  i used to insist on making my food so i can make it the way i like  painting a picture or something  exhausting  most day i feel like a shell of a human being  and im slowly even loosing the motivation to mask my desire to no longer exist  i look up painless way to die on every other day basis in depth  im sometimes worry about whats stopping me from going to a country that allows elective suicide and remember it the   people who i think love me  and when i feel like im abandoned by them or like i cant talk to them  it so much worse because the utter loneliness claw into my heart and soul in a scarily strong way to the point i just dont allow myself to move for a few hour or else maybe ill jump down the stair like the thought are thinking  or cut myself with that kitchen knife by me  or the pill or the car  i dont want to die those way despite not wanting to exist but in those moment the pain of living feel strongerand thought so much stronger  im done    i think the main reason im done is because im tired of being failed time and time again by other people  maybe it a combination where i slowly cutoff the judgemental and pushy people in my lifeand then realized they were the only one who actually cared  i meet new people and put so much effort into pleasing them and getting to know them and trying to have fun or at least they will have fun so i will too  im so tired to put month into someone i think is a decent person only to be left out or worse kept in but constantly used and left hurt  i feel like the world ha gotten to such an evil point that while there are good and caring people who arent entitled or self absorbed  but rather grateful and empathetic  able to put themself in your shoe  the chance i will meet them especially since im so self isolated and socially awkward now are slim to none  is it so wrong to think life isnt worth living without people like that in my life  i have  but i feel like a burden to them  and my mom is one of them  they can only handle so muchand i have so much damage   ive gotten here by tuning out the world with meaningless game and show and book but my mind can only be distracted by fiction for so long  it want out and i do too    if you were to ask me what i like about myself id say im loyal and caring  thats it  followed by million of flaw and mistake  whats worse is i see the two people wanting me to start living again  i see them growing sick of the empty person ive become  and im trying so hard even though i find it can only be painful  but just one thing can go wrong and that motivation is wrecked  im trying to find joy in life  in the little thing  like the wind on your skin  the beauty of a sunset  the love of my pet cat and feeling their fluffy fur a they purr  the taste of food  etc  but those cant be the only thing keeping me here because theyre temporary and unsustainable to enjoy constantly  i have to find a job and a way to be independent  i have to    you can call me soft or sensitive i dont care  it nothing i dont tell myself  but the feeling are still there  the overwhelming hate for life i feel every morning i wake up  every miscommunication or argument  every little thing  a simple phrase or action that reminds me  yeah no one want to be around you  every pathetic thing i do to try and get the few people who do care to show me or justspend time with me which only make me feel like im forcing them  no one asks me to go do anything and why would they  when ive shown i have no motivation for anything everytime i try to express these feeling weighing me down because im told thats how to heal im reaffirmed that all they do is upset and burden people  all still there  i keep telling myself my leaving would be a bigger burden but there many time i doubt that    i cant say what i truly feel most of the time because im scared they may think im trying to excuse myself for not being functional or they may think im making them feel bad for not being enough when it not their fault that im just a lonely black hole of hopelessness  or im scared ill be laughed at like i have in the past  or it will ruin their happiness in that moment  even if theyre currently hurting me in that moment    it okay  ill bring it up at a better time  there never come a better time    i know i need therapy but when youve tried and not liked about   with no result  ive found tiktok more helpful than all of them combined  constantly asking question with no advice or feedback  and have little motivation to help yourself to begin with  it not easy  add my insurance being picky with who is in network too and it just becomes a headache that make me feel even more hopeless just thinking about it leading to me avoiding it   there no point in this post  there no request of mine for advice or comment unless you want to  it just a long winded rant  i have these feeling bottled up so much constantly i figured maybe itd do something to put it out there somewhere instead of in a note in my phone where no one will ever see it again which is my usual way of trying to survive it,depression
1240,so  i don t think i fit the group of people that ha a  chemical imbalance  even when everything else going on in life is pretty a okay   i know exactly what s causing me to feel depressed      relationship issue and lack of friend  spent   whole year dwelling        dealing with the mood swing of a narcissistic parent       mild cptsd  according to my therapist  from hearing family fight constantly       no job lack of income  feeling worthless from not hearing back from anyone       the house we live in is borderline dilapidated  bedbug  no ac  mold  etc  so we need to move  but we can t move because none of u ha a job yet  a stressful cycle   so when i think about it  i m like  yeah  no shit i m depressed now  i feel like anyone would be in those condition   so my question is  if a lot of it is entirely environmental  should i still consider anti depressant or not  i very much have all the sign  lack of motivation  feeling of worthlessness  lack of interest  fatigue  etc ,depression

1266,sorry for my bad english   i m gay and i like to be feminine  i cut my hair short  my parent pressured me to do it because i go to a public military school   it s a normal school but managed by a lieutenant but i didn t even have to go to school  it s my last year going there tho   my tall hair gave me a feminine look and a good look in general and made me unique  and i wa who i am  though it s my last year in the school i feel so depressed every time i see a guy with tall hair because many public and private school aren t military their student are allowed to tall their hair and here i am not allowed because school enrollment depends on where i live  and unfortunately i live near it   and i also feel so depressed when i see  for example  a tiktok of gay white guy enjoying their adolescence and expressing themselves the way they like not fearing being judged or hurt by their parent while i m struggling with just growing my hair  i m done with this life  i have no hope or anything to boost me to study or develop my skill trying to leave this shithole country for it would be too late  i d feel i didn t live my adolescence and youth right    what would you say to me ,depression
