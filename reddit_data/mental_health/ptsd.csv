7,i am the main supporter of my partner who ha ptsd i have a great therapist and my loved one are typically empathetic but i find that very few people in my life really get it it being the extent of his trauma what that mean for my partner and what it mean for me i think a community of other partnerssupporters would help me show up for my partner better and cope with what can sometimes be a very emotionally intense environment a lot of the thing ive come across are geared towards military spouse which doesnt apply to u the ptsd partner sub is okay but i would prefer something more active i would really benefit from a community of other people who love and care for someone with ptsd and who want to be the best partner possible for them it seems like a lot of folk in my position end up coming here which is a resource i appreciate but are there any discord server or online group for partnerssupporters thanks in advance sorry if i missed a resource somewhere or if the formatting suck  im on mobile,anxiety

11,i have spent the last   year battling ptsd disaster related and a number of other factor  i genuinely believe that i turned the corner several year ago  that is until now  i feel i have gone backwards ever since i have successfully managed to get my second book published  yet just like the first book i have been subjected to a vengeful hate campaign  the first book wa published in   it got so bad that i had to withdraw from social medium primarily facebook  several year on i returned to the fold a it were  yet again i have been severely victimised following the release of the second book  i have now permanently deleted my facebook account and that of twitter  is all of this bitter jealousy  possibly  is it toxic hate  probably  is it an orchestrated smear campaign  definitely  this second conflict ha really destroyed me beyond reason  there are many support group out there who claim that they are there to help the victim  i have been part of two such group relating to the same tragedy  for obvious reason i will not name the tragedy or the group involved  one speaks of being non judgemental  yet i feel that i am being judged and targeted with false allegation which had been unfounded  their claim were shocking along the line of  were you really there at the disaster you are making money out of tragedy you are a liar  you have upset some who were there  have you really got ptsdi wish to counteract these false assertion a such  yes  would i have been able to write two book on this if i were not there  secondly i have found photographic evidence i wa there  i have appeared in local press report and i have been on national radio with a fellow victim  i have not made money  the first book i had to borrow money from my parent to fund publication of the book  the second book i had to use my own compensation money to fund the publication the obvious truth is that lawyer who represented me needed to know absolutely everything about the tragedy before a pay off wa made just like many other victim who forwarded a claim  i am not a liar  when i wa on facebook originally i created a support group of my own and looking back i feel that i genuinely helped a lot of people  a regard this just before i left facebook one person hijacked the group and ran it for herself  the same person who labelled me a a liar  yes i had run in with several people and argument occurred  i am not proud with some of my behaviour but it wa a two way street  having ptsd doe a lot of negative thing to the mind absolutely  i do have ptsd  i wa finally diagnosed about ten year ago  i now take medication  mg of sertraline per day  i also attended emdr therapy for a timeas far a i am concerned i have refuted every allegationin my  year of life i have experienced much whether physical emotional or psychological  through it all i have always seemingly to posse the strength fortitude and deep resolve to pull through  this latest setback ha hit hard beyond any kind of reason  some five year after the tragedy that i have talked about i lost my younger brother in a different kind of tragedy  without going into too much detail he wa studying towards a degree at university  ever since his teenage year my late brother had suffered from deep depression and severe anxiety  he had to be sectioned twice  after shocking treatment at one psychiatric facility he wa transferred to another unit and the care he received wa outstanding  eventually he wa released and applied to go to university  some three month later he suffered a severe psychotic episode and eventually ended up in a so called secure unit which ha a terrible reputation of neglect suicide and unexplained death  he somehow escaped from the unit and disappeared into the cold dark november night  his body wa found the next morning beside a huge roadbridge  this rocked out family beyond compare  my elderly parent described me a their rockreally it would be what any normal dutiful son would willingly do  i really do not know how i coped  actually i do not think i really did surviving on huge amount of alcohol and rage  a the year rolled by i found some kind of inner belief and maturity  i nursed both of my late parent through terminal illness my dad through cancer my mum with dementia  i guess i did not recognise my own physical frailty along the way  in  i spent four month in hospital with a number of extremely serious condition  i wa not expected to pull through  yet i did  when you confront your own mortality it truly make you think and grab hold of positivity  i think that my strength and deep resolve helped me immensely  i need that strength and resolve even more right now  throughout all of those dark demonic day i do not think that i ever really contemplated suicide  yes i had thought flashing across my mind but never dug deep enough to think that i wa worthless  the last few week i certainly have  i keep thinking that surviving an horrific tragedy like i did if i wa another death statistic well at least i would not be condemned a being a fake a liar or a fraud  i know that i have turned my life around very little alcohol healthier diet and regular exercise but when you have these dark thought what else is therethank you for reading,anxiety

30,the following is noted in the description box of this communitywe can not diagnose you with ptsd here if you think you have ptsd please see a licensed professionalyou are probably well aware that nobody here can make an official diagnosis for you but you may nonetheless would like to hear the opinion of someone that suffers from ptsd you may dont want to have to wait for month to finally get an appointment you may do not have the financial mean or access you may feel ashamed to open up to a stranger in real life you may fear that you are overreacting and seek confirmation that your suffering is severe enough to contact a psychologistpsychiatristi understand why you would like to hear someone opinion here or why you are scrolling through the post looking for a similiar experience however id like to explain to you why this might not be a good ideaour own experience doesnt make u expert ive seen people here stating that ptsd is solely diagnosed based on symptom thats falsejust because you struggle with a past experience doesnt automatically mean that you suffer from ptsd in the context of ptsd there is a quite specific definition to the term trauma and if your experience doesnt meet that definition you wont be diagnosed with ptsd regardless of the symptom you havewhether your experience doe meet that definition or not is up to an expert to decideneither you or we can make that determination because we dont know your life story we dont know if you share everything with u about that experience or not we dont know if you downplay what happened so when you get the answer from u that your experience doesnt meet the definition of trauma it doesnt necessarily mean that you dont have ptsd at the same time is it possible that you unconsciously exaggerate the event because it becomes a proxy for another issue you struggle withif your experience meet the definition of trauma it doesnt automatically mean that you have ptsd ptsd is just one of several mental disorder that we can suffer from after experiencing trauma the symptom of mental disorder are often overlapping with other mental disorder and therefore a differential diagnosis is important it could also be that there is comorbidity so when you read about our symptom here and they do not fully align with yours it could be because it is another mental disorder or because you or the person who ha written the post suffers from more than one mental disorder following a traumatic eventand keep in mind when you read post here that you cant be sure that they really have ptsd fe factitious ptsdeven with all of this in mind the response you get from u when you ask u if what you have sound like ptsd or when you read about our experience it will ultimately influence you and may even affect your mental healthif you find yourself in this subreddit you clearly struggle it doesnt matter if it ptsd or not you need to contact a licensed professional because you are sufferingto everyone who ha ptsd whatever we write online and whatever we tell people can have consequence therefore it is important that we try our best to not spread misinformation like fe that the nature of the traumatic event doesnt play a role in the diagnosis process we also should be aware of the consequence our word could have and chose them carefullyto everyone claiming to have ptsd for the purpose of attentionseeking the way people react to our diagnosis depends on what society perceives ptsd to be if people start to selfdiagnose ptsd based on tiktoks we are the one suffering the consequence because we will no longer be taken seriously anymore your suffering is real you deserve to be heard and you deserve help however your suffering doe not give you the right to claim to have ptsd someone who take mental disorder incl ptsd seriously doe not engage in selfdiagnosing based on information they read on social medium,anxiety
31,hi  basically the title this past holiday season my partner wa admitted to the hospital for a severe and unidentifiable illness they were sick for  week prior to hospitalization for  day  and then still sick the week following their release the physician overseeing my loved one care were unable to come up with an affirmative diagnosis     fast forward to now and the most recent bloodwork show my partner is normalizing and they are getting better  meanwhile my sadness and anxiety are through the roof ive previously been diagnosed with gad and mdd a well a asd  other mental issue  so i suppose i wa already at risk     im having a lot of dissociative episode  and intrusive thought that were not present before and other than one night of hallucination during the hospitalization the onset of this ha been ever since my partner ha been well but now im not well and it scaring me,anxiety

34,this is going to be long im fifteen year old for contextas a young teen and preteen i used to see character on tv with probably badly represented romantised ptsd getting infantilised and taken care of by sympathetic family and friend and i always felt jealous then some stuff still sort of ongoing happened and i got some possibly ptsd like symptom which nearly completely went away when i developed anorexia although ive always had hightened emotional reaction to thing so i dont know whether they were symptom or noti still have anorexia but it consuming my thought le these day and that combined with other thing have caused the feeling to come back in the last seven monthsbut i dont know whether i just desperately want to valuation of having ptsd i am prone to convincing myself i have certain illness physical and mental a a weird sort of comfort the only mental illness i wa receiving treatment for during this time wa anorexia ive managed to get out of treatment for that nowi did have a phonecall with the doctor once that the therapist my school assigned me recommended because she thought i might have ptsd but the phonecall went awfully i couldnt finish my sentence i wa shaking and cry and he said what id experienced wa too everyday for ptsd and i agreed and apologised not because i believed him but because i thought that if i did have ptsd i shouldnt have the confidence to avocate for myself it did feel like i wa acting without admitting that to myself my mum started arguing with the doctor and i started screaming at my mum then the phonecall ended and me and my mum had a massive irrational arguementafter that my therapist promised me she wouldnt make me have another appointment even though i secretly wanted onein a few month ill be going back to my old art therapist for general therapy so shell help me deal with anything that im not faking anyway so i guess this post is pointless because i dont need a diagnosismy symptom are a bit weird a well i do sometimes have nightmare about thing but the emotion in the nightmare really varies sometimes im sad or scared but sometimes im watching the event im rememberingimagining usually a mixture of both a a film and finding it funny or exciting in a twisted way sort of way sometimes when something should distress me i get the urge to laugh both in real life and in dream im obsessing over the stuff that happened constantly but it not always unpleasant since there a sense of familiarity too it by now maybe it is unpleasant but i cant imagine doing anything different ive melded my identity to it even if thats just in my own head since i only talk about it with my mum really i get randomly shaking hand and headache and when i think about something that bother me i sometimes get dizzy and have heartrate spike sometimes i get these physical symptom while emotionally i feel calm i am thinking about the bad memory im always thinking about it when im not thinking anorexic stuff but i dont get emotionally distressed a much a i used to for day at a time i can taste or smell thing relating to bad memoriesmy primary symptom is this one sometimes constant sort of sensory hallucination is that a thing that i have this specific injury that i saw someone else have im both scared if this injury and darkly obsessed with it like sometimes i cant watch specific thing on tv but then draw or write these really graphic horrific thing that i hide around my room and take out to look at if i cant look at them i freakout that something bad will happenalso when im home alone i used makeup to draw the injury onto myself and then take edit and look at large amount of photo of them i have on one occasion accidentally mildly injured myself and used stuff from that mild injury to recreate the injury i saw someone else have and i got creepily excited and comforted by the fact that itd be more realistic and id be closer to the person whod been hurttheres this one specific day that i mainly think about even though it wasnt the worse ive heard from someone about a day im sure wa the worse but i dont think i can remember the specific bad thing that happened although i do have a vague memory of it around that time i had a tense relationship with a lot of my family and do know my memory blanked in an argument with my grandma which wa possibly the day of the really bad thing and if not then within the same week it also possible the person relating to the bad thing came up in the arguement i do remember specific thing from just before the bad thing happened but i remember those specific thing quite fondly and generally remember that i wa having fun even though i found out two year later what happened so i knew i couldnt have beeni also dont really want my problem to be cured because i feel like it the only proof i have that im a good person with feeling since the bad memory are all focused around thing ive seen happen to someone else whenever im feeling like a terrible person

75,trigger warningi need help i dont know if this wa narcissistic abuse physical abuse and sexual coercion or not please help me i went through a breakup and got kicked out of the house i wa living at i decided to stay with a friend who i think is a narc from the moment he picked me up and brought me to his house he started to hold my hand sit closer to me stuff like that i wanted the comfort so i didnt mind i just didnt want to feel alone but i certainly wasnt looking for anything physical that night  day after my breakup just after getting kicked out he told me he liked me a i wa sitting on his couch i didnt really know what to say maybe i liked him too he wa being nice to me when i had no one confused i told him i had feeling for him too i shouldnt have he wa insanely excited spent all night complimenting me and the next few day hed take me out to the movie restaurant etc during the day hed do and say extremely romantic thing i wont lie i liked feeling taken care of but this quickly turned sour hed start mentioning sex a lot hed start touching me in way i wa uncomfortable with way in which i felt like i owed it to him because he wa being nice to me id try to have a conversation with him and hed be trying to put his hand on me id push them away and hed come right back he asked me if he could kiss me i said no he kept asking and asking and eventually i gave in and kissed him back hed start spanking me choking me thing like that in a sexual way but wed never come up with rule a safe word nothing like that so this wasnt exactly consensual a few time he smacked my face which i didnt even know how to react to i think it turned him on how wa i supposed to react wa i supposed to like it we werent even doing anything sexual i felt like he wa just trying to exert power over me in those moment i didnt always turn down his advance sometimes i kissed him or gave him hickies because he asked me to i didnt really do much on my own accord mainly him asking me to do thing and i felt like i should hed keep trying to get his hand in my pant and id always push them away but hed keep trying i made up excuse for why i didnt want him to touch me there one time i remember getting him a shirt from his closet and he came in and closed the door behind him and pushed me against the wall kissing me and trying to touch me at first i let it happen but then i started to get really uncomfortable i kept saying stop i need a break thing like that hed stop for a second and then hed keep going i eventually got him to stop hed frequently grab my neck at unexpected time i remember one time coming out of the bathroom at a restaurant where he wa waiting for me and he grabbed me and tried kissing me but i pushed him off to that he said something along the line of what youre mine now so i can do whatever i want to you i felt uncomfortable but i told myself it wa fine we never established safe word or really had a talk about what wa okay sexual wise if thing didnt turn out the way he wanted them to hed get mad at me hed try to be romantic and if i responded wrong to his romance then i wa ruining his vision and hed get upset with me hed ask who i wa texting when i wa on my phone and then hed say i didnt give him enough attention a few time he even took my phone and wouldnt give it back to me hed say he wa probably too much for me when i said no to him physically and said all his ex had a problem with his touchiness maybe a a way to guilt trip me i sent him picture because i thought itd make him be nice to me i shouldnt have i regret it when i eventually left and went somewhere safer after being there for about a week what we had dissolved quickly even though while i wa there he had told me he loved me he wanted to marry me thing like that we werent even dating but i just kinda went along with it i wa in a trauma response and couldnt think straight now that i wa out of his house he wa still asking me and pressuring me about sex but he wa also saying he wasnt sure he could be with me relationship wise since my ex wa his friend within a week he stopped talking to me all together i desperately tried to get him to talk to me a few time i sent him picture because i wanted to try to get him to talk to me at first he only responded when i talked about sexual thing but then he pretty much stopped responding all together i regret my mean of trying to get his attention back but he wa all i had  i wa desperate i begged him to just stay my friend not even anything more because i didnt want to be alone but he said he needed space from me and didnt talk to me for  week i finally called him telling him i missed him a a friend and only a friend nothing more he told me he never cared about our friendship like i did and only did thing he knew i would like to try to gain my trust he only did the thing he did because he knew id like them wa this manipulation i wasnt sure he told me he only cared about himself and nobody else and didnt care if we never talked again i told him that hurt my feeling and again he said im sorry you feel that way but i dont care within the next week almost everyone i knew had stopped talking to me and had started hanging out with him all the time turn out he had been lying to people about me for a while telling them how terrible of a person i wa and that they should ditch me he ha essentially turned everyone against me by lying and saying we slept together which we never did and that im an awful person and now i am alone and dont know if this wa narc abuse or if im just a stupid girl please offer some insight and be nice im really suffering alone in silence here and dont know what to do ive been having extreme flashback fear of intimacy fear of physical abuse trust issue nightmare being frozencant move i hope

76,i suffer from ptsd from job and an abusive relationshipthe relationship ha ended no contact for over a year new relationship with very kind personmy job i had  year ago i got in a car accident and my manager berated me for not showing up to work on time in then didnt apply anywhere for that time because i used the time to heal i just took a job and my manager screamed at me and then locked me out of the building by accident in the rain and instead of returning he just said wait around for maintenance he also never trained me for anything and thrown me in then leaf before i can even ask for help been there two weeksi went to a counselor because of suicidal ideation and problem job hunting and she said my degree in humanity is useless no wonder youre having trouble finding a jobis most of the population like this i dont think i can handle being treated like this so much i havent felt this unhappy is agesplease tell me this isnt normal or there are good work culture out there god,anxiety
77,i have had previous emotionalphysicalsexual abuse in my previous and first relationship i dont want it to stop me from feeling connected with my new healthy partner my ex had a pxrn addiction he even admitted it but before i found out i could sense his disinterest and it wa painful it became a few year of me being dismissed he told me it wa stress so i didnt want him to feel pressured but once i found out about the pxrn he told me i wasnt visually stimulating enough like the curvier woman he wa watching mind you i had no issue w pxrn at the time but it wa excessive and actively my replacement he would say no to me and then find his category in the bathroom at some point during our relationship i woke up to him rxping me but i passed back out before i could say anything and im not sure why i wa so tired in the first place  this ha been nothing but ups and down getting through but i did find healthy safe sex with my new partner the problem now is sometimes i lock up or even when im not locked up i dont finish a excessively a i used to and my love take it personally  im with a new partner and he so supportive and i have told him just about everything i can remember from that horrible as period in my life the issue is he take it personally when im unable to finish but i dont even see it negatively everything feel good and im just happy to be present with him because the intimacy isnt something im used to and is honestly sometimes just a fluttering a an orgasm we started out a a friend with benefit situation and then i had a lot le trouble finishing he compare it to then to when i felt le inhibited i very much love him and want to be with him and am satisfied but being a present during sex ha been more difficult and triggering we have to stop a lot i know it my fear of being vulnerable in a relationship again for a whole hoopla of reason but my ex wa who i lost my virginity to so it is my whole experience im trying to wrestle basically how do i push through this so that i can feel more relaxed and present during sex or how do i explain to him that it not him and i really enjoy our connection even when it doesnt come with an orgasm im rebuilding my idea of sex so thats it something safe but the pressure to finish so my partner doesnt get upset with himself is a lot,anxiety

88, this past year i have gone through rather a lot im m and ive been on and off with low mood anxiety and depression and had passive suicidal ideation for a long a i can remember but this past year i sought out substantial help through therapy because i had the mean and it wa affecting my ability to do everything and anything i recently had to suspend my work and study because of it all i now know ive been experiencing onandoff psychosis and emotional flashback of trauma that occurred in my childhood ive learned that i wa abused by my sibling and wa punished for such abuse by a parent because i wa confused and my sibling blamed me for everything and got me to do thing that i wont go into there wa a lot of oldfashioned traditional punishment and unpredictable outburst from my parent that i still have memory of i wa also emotionally neglected by both parent my memory are of them being so selfabsorbed and me being gaslighted and forced to play happy family in front of people not in the close family i think this is generational trauma adult me honestly doesnt know why they had kid  i wa brought up in a very dysfunctional family and this ha been my basis for forming friendship and relationship consequently ive had a rather lonely existence so far i estranged myself from them at  and wa never home except for sleep food and a desk studied hard went to university and forgot about it the most messed up thing is i knew none of this i repressed it all and thought all this wa normal deserved and expected but only now can i see it for what it is after talking to professional about it all i thought all my issue were just part of who i am but no it is the bondage and bind of that traumatic period of my life when i wa a child and teenager im currently going through edmr for the cptsd which i am very excited about a it worked on one particular memory and plan to use this a a springboard into better timessince learning or realizing this im seeing similar dynamic in my relationship with my partner now of  year im now of the belief that i fell for the first person in my life that gave me some form of validation emotional assurance and kept on doubling down on it i think i made a big mistake without knowing it and now that my healing fantasy are breaking i believe i deserve better and want to get all this abuse and trauma behind me i want all this experience to have no power over who i am or what i will be i want to break away from the bind and the positivity of therapy and edmr is making me realize this can be real and is not just a dream im also seeing the way i have been and am being manipulated on a daily basis and it is making me feel incredibly bad for not noticing i just dont know how or what my option are a i feel i cant trust my environment or my intuition i am only beginning to trust my judgment again and nurturing a new selfconfidence i also think my upbringing ha made it incredibly hard for me to make choice and trust and rely on people and be independent i want this all to end but i dont know how to get there or what i can do or rely on i really need guidance but all the traditional or obvious call or support network are a no go for me unless you know of one that i can use and have missedim not trying to make a list of grievance it just ive never been able to talk about this with anyone or feel i have a voice in my experience i think im looking for assurance that this is a messedup situation a i dont think i can properly judge it it ha also been sobering writing all this for the post i also know this is probably a biased crowd but a in the last part of this post i am more asking for solution and advice i imagine others have been through similar and have suggestion anyway im always wrong my emotion arent valid i dont know how but my role ha been house cleaning and sorting but not to my standard or way of working there is a strong financial imbalance in income them owning the house and me paying subsidized rent i thought this wa helpful but it is being used over me and threatened to be withdrawn when i push back or express my situation and discus the need for change they also have no care for the environment and frequently litter in the house even after i bring up the issue which make it feel like im cleaning up after them and am just used a a house cleaner we have no kid but a difficult and reactive dog who resource guard that we both wanted and got together who i care about a lot and am mainly responsible for i do worry if i leave the dog will not get it necessary care and i dont know where itll end up when the dog ha been at it worse discussion about it is turn into have you done x y and z and if not then it kind of like dont complain unless you do all this without the context of certain symptom of psychosis and cptsd meaning i cannot guarantee doing x y or z i am not allowed to slip up once and it is used all the time a an example of me being unreliable but they can make a many mistake a possible at the worst point in this year it ha felt like caring for the dog ha been my fulltime job and all i should be doing when divvying up job and labour in the house we have a dog behaviorist which is very helpful and give u idea and made it easier but still the discussion between u is not constructive it end up similar to what is described in the other paragraphsthey hold their job the importance of their work and job their obligation for ownership of the house over me and recently with all that i am going through they tell me that my ability to sort out my issue is a luxury these usually come up a a last remark in dispute and argument when this happened during the worst of my psychosis and my depression it would bring my confidence so low and exacerbate thing i know i am privileged but it feel like i am just starting to stand and a boulder is routinely thrown at me outside of work they just watch tv or are on tiktok and ask for me to not bother them it feel like i dont exist and a lot of the time they will just spring task onto me mainly dog or house related i used to do them thinking i wa being helpful but now they are sometimes the only thing they will talk to me about if i push back i am unreasonable unhelpful and wrong if i highlight my preference or request a boundary and they disagree it is interpreted a an attack on their judgment and they make me feel unreasonable they keep on telling simple untruth to my face and when i highlight them they scream shout or cry at me and i feel so small and that ive done wrong truth and fact seem to have become emotional opinion i find it hard to navigate strong emotional outburst like this and it put me in a childlike stance i often think i am being emotionally manipulated i know this is not right or true or considering physical fact but because of how isolated i am and dependent on them i usually give up and it isnt worth the time to argue and accept their point this ha accumulated over many small instance and it is now unbearable and i cant handle it anymore in a lot of our conversation about this whole conflicting atmosphere i openly admit im flawed ive now realized they never do and i get youre selling yourself short which confuses me a i am being realistic this doubly hurt a it make me feel not heard and that i am in the wrong and doing this on myself when i am trying to heal a lot of this i have discovered when trying to implement the thing ive discussed with my therapist and read about this is also a summary to highlight the main issue but i havent included everything  everything just feel impossible to manage i honestly feel i cannot talk about my goal my need and how i want to grow without it being seen a an attack on them it also feel like i am being given so many task and job that i cannot think develop or attempt my goal my need etc i used to believe this wa a puzzle to be solved together but now i see it is unsolvable and i have been the only one trying to solve it for both of u it seems we can only agree on thing when i ignore or suppress my want or emotion through reaching out i know nothing can be wrong all the time but i wa conditioned by my upbringing that this is the case and this is why ive awakened to this situation i am in at the beginning of our relationship this used to not be an issue i think i have been waiting for thing to go back to how they used to be but i am realizing now that this is a fantasy and i wa living in the pasti want to know if people have been through similar experience and what advice others can give me what did you do if my story resonates with yours please comment or message and help me i feel so trapped everyday feel like im reliving the same thing and it torturous i have a few week before i can act on removing myself and i want to be smart and a strategic a possible in how i do it because of the lack of available support from my family how isolated i am in the house and where we live and the difficulty in thing coming up in therapy this ha been my life for a while so i can wait a bit longer and there is no particular rush at the moment i am putting up a mask that i havent made these observation that is allowing me to see clearly and plan i see myself in a position of trying to set myself up for the most success and break away from the conditioning that occurred in my childhood and upbringing and i hope there are others who have been through something similar to advise and guide me i used to think i wa alone but i now know i am not  what do i need to do to get organized and make sure i have sorted before i leavehow should i plan and be organizedwhat should i be prepared for in being manipulated to not go ahead with itif i do decide to leave how do i go about doing itwhat should my

107,in recent time i have seen multiple people complaining that this subreddit doesnt allow for flair to differentiate between those who have officially been diagnosed by a lisenced professional and those that havent yet gone through that process additionally we frequently see post asking if it could be ptsdthen there also are post by prople that do not necessarily have ptsd but traumaeverybody deserves to be heard and deserves help and i respect the mod decision to not limit member to those that have officially been diagnosed unfortunately not everyone ha access and afterall we dont know if someone ha ptsdpersonally i sometimes feel uncomfortable sharing certain experience a i do not want someone who potentially doe not have ptsd to get confronted with it i also increasingly hesitate to comment under post a i dont want to end up giving recommendation to someone that might not have ptsd and my answer turning out to be harmful in their casei probably overthink this but in case there are people who sometimes feel the same wayive created an additional subbredit that is limited to those with an official diagnosis by a licensed professional it a very small community that could serve a an additionof course we will just have to trust that people are honest nonetheless i think this could be a good solution for those here that recently expressed their concern and asked for label at the same time this subreddit can stay a place for all peopleas ive said everyone deserves to be heard and deserves helpthe subreddit is called rdiagnosedptsd if you are interested in becoming a member you can add a user flair with your specific diagnosis,anxiety

112,ive been doing fine with taking step towards building a support network since i dont currently have a strong one like letting people know generally what i went through communicating and enforcing my boundary etc but when im really really struggling with something like a trigger or suicidal thought i have no idea how to reach out for help i guess it more challenging since i dont have someone that feel close enough for me to reach out to immediately i dont want to randomly burden someone with the responsibility of helping me i have therapy a couple time a month but ive never experienced intense emotion in therapy and my memory is always so hazy so it hard to recount the time i wa really struggling i know it important to have support but i dont know what im supposed to do without close friend or family,anxiety
113,i wa in an abusive relationship and im really going through it at the moment with trauma and having to recount it all i had a friend who wa just a bit much and he constantly brought it up and made some comment amd joke about my assault he kept telling me that the guy wa going to prison and they were finding lawyer and all this legal stuff despite having no legal background the reality is the case will probably be dropped but every  second he gave me his opinion and why im wrongit wasnt just that it wa little thing that would trigger me like everything i did wa wrong everything i said wa stupid and needed explaining to me like i wa  constantly bragging about money and his earnings and what he had and why i dont have the right thing he ha some special need so i just assumed it wa thathe came over and i asked him to stop saying some thing several time and he just went no and would randomly open my drawer and look for thing and ask where thing were asking me a thousand question about what happened with my ex and what im telling police etc even making comment about my study note on the wall about how it wa easy and he wa just going to memorise it the night before and get higher than me this hot and cold thing of being really nice and then doing all that a welli found it massively triggering and i felt really trapped because he wouldnt leave and it wa constantly like he wanted something from me like in that way and then saying oh no youre wrong even though it obvious eventually i just said youre giving me an attack and then basically pushed him out when he stood up and i basically had to sit there thinking is it happening again am i being played again and i woke up this morning and blocked him but i cant help feeling like im overreacting i did it because i saw similarity between him and my ex because he wouldnt stop if i said no he wouldnt accept what i wa saying and it wa triggering for me and i didnt want to risk going through it againi just cant stop thinking about whether i did the right thing and if i overreacted and lost a perfectly good friendship over my trauma though,anxiety
114,i keep thinking about what im hoping to get out of continuing to live my life and there just isnt anything i cant think of anything at all that i still want to do or that brings me any kind of happiness or satisfaction or anything i care about achieving or anything at all like that there just nothing i dont even enjoy the simple shit that other people seem to like entertainment or food or sex none of it it all just feel like a waste of time even though there nothing at all that i consider to be a better use for my time eitherim just waking up every day and trying to fill in all the time i have before i can go back to sleep again hopefully managing to at least find something to do thats distracting enough so that i can avoid thinking about how fucking existentially bored i am my therapist is impressed that im so depressed and still manage to go to the gym every day but what the fuck else am i going to do i dont get anything out of going but i already struggle to find shit to do all day so if anything it le effort for me to keep going because it one le hour of my day i have to try to figure out how to fill in somehowive gotten to that point again with my current therapist that i always seem to get to with them where they run out of thing to try and just flat out ask me what im actually hoping to get out of our appointment and i have to tell them that i honestly dont know because all i can say is that i want to have some kind of thing that feel like it keeping me here but i dont even know what the fuck that would be let alone how to work towards it and everything i try just make me feel nothing at allevery time i think about this i just feel this overwhelming urge to just not be here whats the point if there literally nothing i can think of that im hoping to gain or care about achievement from living another  or so year the only reason i dont do it is because there a person i talk to who seems to have become pretty reliant on me for support and she doesnt have anyone else so i feel like i have an obligation not to make her life any worse but that in itself cause me to feel trapped too so paradoxically the only thing keeping me here is just one more contributing factor to why i dont want to be here i just dont know what to do or what the point of any of this is,anxiety

124,sometimes i feel like the word trauma dumping get used really casually by selfproclaimed nontraumatised people in a subconscious attempt to shame traumatised individual for sharing about their trauma with honesty wa talking to someone new recently and they were heavy on the sex angle wanted to have a fwb relationship with me to which i told them that i wa actually tired of hooking up where there no purpose to it conversation continued with his probing of me to share more of why i wa tired why i seemed to hookup with many people what happened to me why i had intrusive thought that convinced me i wa going to be rped soon that drove me to lose my virginity to a stranger and continue hooking up to prepare myself for the extent of violence and helplessness of such an assault which ended up with me getting rped what kind of kink i had what the chronology of my experience of sexual violence wa because he had been forming kind of a timeline of whatever i shared about the thing that happened to me and realised he wa mistaken and wanted to clarify he asked question i gave him short answer eg started hooking up because of hypersexuality stemming from sexual trauma he wa shocked but probed anyway eg oh what happened i answered honestly with more detail eg event happened to me i didnt give him gruesome detail when he probed just the gist of what happened and how it affected my sex life after digesting it after he had probed in the moment he decided he had been uncomfortable with the sharing and said i trauma dumped on himif you probe im going to answer im not going to sugarcoat it for you if you didnt probe it would have stayed vague you dont get to call someone insensitive absolving themselves of any responsibility for the impact of hearing about their trauma on your feeling toxic because of it and trauma dumping on you then make a sweeping statement that they are going to trauma dump on everyone and nobody will want them a a partner because of it just because you decided long after the fact of you probing that the answer made you uncomfortable you probed then didnt enjoy the answer you got but at no point did you express you were uncomfortable and wanted to stop talking about it when you had so many opportunity to say hey let not talk about this anymore a im feeling quite overwhelmed i wa not going into monologue of every gruesome detail of what happened but you didnt and continued to probe for more detail because you wanted to talk about it at the timeyou get to feel uncomfortable of course and you get to excuse yourself from the conversation but you dont get to cry trauma dumping after you realise  day later that the answer to your own probing made you uncomfortable that is simply not how trauma dumping work and you using it so cavalierly a criticism on a person character let alone a person youve only known for  day is a blatant insult to people with trauma go read up on what trauma dumping really is and stop acting like youre so much more educated about trauma a a person who say that you have never experienced any trauma than a person who ha experienced traumagod people tire me out,anxiety

140,ive seen several people discus their issue with getting to sleep ive had the same issue but recently have achieved a routine that help me get to sleep and stay asleep this may not work for everyone and feel free to alter a needed but i hope it can help at least one person this may be a bit long but i wanted to make it a detailed a possible i start by preparing my body for bed it in fightorflight for most of the day so relaxing is really important i usually take a shower a bath is ideal but i dont usually have access to a tub but if you have trauma associated with that id suggest some tea warm milk etc etc anything to help you relax and to tell your physical body that it time to rest i take otc sleeping medication and my anxiety medication the anxiety medicine help my body relax further while the otc help me stay asleep i let that rest in my system for about  min   hour depending on how much i need to relax in that time i may put on a comfort show or something else that i know wont induce any anxiety that medication combo ha been approved by my doctor it absolutely not required but it greatly help me at the least id suggest melatonin supplement  i then get into bed i sleep with a weighted blanket to help relax myself but if the weight would make you anxious then of course disregard that i also have a weighted sleep mask to help me feel more secure along with my pillow that i cuddle if weight make you anxious any soft blanket will do rather than listen to music which ive found can make me start to overthink ill usually play rain noise or white noise if youre a fan of music id at least suggest some jazz or orchestral music anything with word subconsciously make me anxious when drifting off to sleep ive found it better to allow myself to go through my ritual in my head for instance i always have to go through a mental routine to ensure that im safe it involves counting lock between myself and a certain point security measure etc if im anxious that a door isnt locked ill allow myself to get up and check it and even take a photo of the lock if i feel it going to continue to make me anxious ill then return to step  once ive cycled through my important routine i actually manually induce a routine of having my brain describe the layer of my bed it sound odd but including that into my routine make relaxing more organic by describing soft sheet and comforter my body and brain are able to recognize that were in a safe environment just like it doe with the lock from there im usually able to go to sleep if i do wake up from a nightmare or flashback ill allow myself to get up use the bathroom drink some water and mentally reset it better to allow yourself to get up and calm down rather than fight for sleep again ill usually return to step  but depending on how im feeling i may put on an episode of a comfort show my body is already exhausted so at that point the show doesnt usually keep me upthats my routine it greatly improved my sleep habit which im very grateful for i hope it can help someone feel free to ask any question or drop any of your own tip ,anxiety

142,ampxbokay this is long but i really struggle with dating advice is appreciated for refrence i am fstudentin the balkan there is a huge culture of training like you wont see a guy above  not in the gym while training is good i have been bullied most of my life by guy like this the point where i learnt to hate football make up and even the entire male gender and femininity a a whole because they made me feel like i am some ugly tumor that doesnt deserve respect and need to die they made me cry made me angry made me hysterical for fun until i became overly numb and mute and afraid of people kindness now i doubt everyone and dont trust anyone and am supposed to magically gain friend support and relationship and what not most people my age have had a few partner some have had sex and high school wa jusrt one big hell sometimes due to my anxiety but people just loved to f me over which made me self isolate a lot causei couldnt defend my self and it is not physical hit thing like mean comment and thing being thrown at me but despite middle school being obejctivly worde middle school broke me the lack of friend never being invited or being chosen for anything the lack of verbal communication made me insane and this wa way pre covid in fact covid somewhat made me relax  i hate being looked at i hate being perceived i hate being laughed at i hate how no one took it seriously and no amount of report made them change their behavior they prboably just nodded and continued to treat me badly and the whole thing about me being disgusting and ewwing at me and boy not wanting to sit next to me and fighting over to not breathe near me made me hate my body i cant imagine hugging or having sex with another human being i just wanted to destroy this body so badly i hated every part of it the fact that it weak and i should have handled the bullying better cause the teacher were clearly useless it affected me so badly that i cried a lot in the toilet and had people smirk at me triumphantly a if they won the lottery while i just wanted to hide i wa always very emotiona land for whatever reason due the bullying i wasnt allowed to express emotion no other girl wa messed with for cry or being angry while i had to hide my agression and tear which only made me snap at my parent and other people and act like b i dont understand what kind of monster just love to anger others until they snap and my snap wa even meek and weak to make it worse and no one cared about me in this damned class i have blocked them all on facebook because i want to self harm each time i see how perfect they arethese people ruined my life and those who didnt bully me it seems pitied me the lack of verbal communication wa so bad that i had to talk by force and i hate verbal talking i only talk if itis something i really know about like anime or history and despite having some thing in common i wa deemed the weird girl and wasnt alloed to sing or smile cause it me if i smiled i wa screamed at for why i smile however it my problem that comment affect me so much however ignoring never worked it made me feel weak small and helpless returning back verbally helped a lot but since i aint witty i wa humiliated which made me mute which hurt more than anything i have been through i wa severely anxious and it showed in my body language even learnt to stutter i still dont handle being watched laughed at well it feel like someone is punching me in the stomach bullying still affect me every day and it worry me it will affect me for the rest of my life i even reject guy on date cause they found friend and stopped being bullied while i tolerated abuse for  year cause i didnt want these aholes to kick me out but idk if i did the right thing they stripped me of any sense of identity and confidence i had i even learnt to say no cause i felt threatened for my life due to them being so nasty and demanding and staring at what i do which only made me more awkwardi never seemed to have any problem with other peer from other class or outside of school despite my severe social anxiety at the end i received little money and some scarf and my headteacher told my mum that the class cared about me but i felt physically unsafe around most guy and they made me cry or ignored meso i never felt cared for the hoey girl got hug and princess treatment while i tried not to self harm every single day and overshared to the teacher and anyone who will listen to me ranting about anything hanging out even with nonbullies made me severely uncomfortable even if they were good people to normal people sitting next to someone is about status to me it meant i wasnt the lowest wasnt trash i had a friend someone cared about me and had to sit alone for a very long time and listen to she finally fing went awayi wont sit next to her by a few boy until prom since apperently sitting next to me or being with me on a holiday will kill them it stupid but it hurt it hurt a lot what is so wrong with sitting next to mebreathing next to me it pbly why i never masturbate it hard to make love  to my body when i hate every single centimeter of it i feel like i always got the short end of the stick and got the most abuse out of anyone in my class and even heard a girl she is glad that i wa bullied and not her cause she wa fat i dont know how i always ended up friendless and bullied which is like the most bad and lonely situation i never felt a lonely a high school cause neither guy nor girl liked me and despite having a lot in common with the guy they always invited and talked to the girly mean girl it made me hate boy and femininity a a whole cause like what is the point of being my self or washing my body or teeth or eating cause i will be insulted all over again like always im gonna be treated like lowlife again so what is the pointsometimes i answered back calmly which semed to be the answer but it still hurt every thrown paper or ball at my head laughter mean word i became more weak and vulnerable and now cry a lot more than when i wa a child i try to wear dress and make up but it doesnt feel like me i find it hard to not hate other girl and guy and feel threatened by them cause they had the easy life and my emotion are never taken seriously or cared for so i never share anythign with anyone most people concider me a red flag cause i rarely have friend but if i am honest idk why i dont have friend i guess i am a horrible person no one want and being unwanted make me self isolate i dont share my story cause even people on reddit pity me and tell me that suck no it doesnt suck if i wanted to die it suck to lose your key not to want to die most people cant sympathize and just laugh at me yet i am a huge b if them breaking up with someone isnt apperently a huge deal even though they are on their th partner and i have never dated guy scare me make me cry and put me off i dont know how i should love a man if they creep me out most are mentally slow uneduacated and only care about football and car havent read a book in their life even my mum laughing at me is neough to make me cry i dont know why am i so sensitive it is a curse ignoring and pretending someone bullyish behavior doesnt exist only make it worse but confrotning it is tricky cause bully see people like me below them since i aint mean sassy agressivei prefer to not talk verball but staying silent make them push me to see how far they can push me until i react which i do since i feel threatened but to them it just funny like a cat playing with a mouse and them having the support of friendsothers and upper hand while i feel poweless and helpless people go through war and worse thing but when it come to bullying most people are bullied a few month or a year while i had people be aholes to me from th to th grade and in th grade i started with friend and all and suddenly wa all alone and i dont even know why the boy left me for dead to chase girl i hate being a coward i hate how i had to hate the male gender and girl to survive i hate how they made me hate every single part of my self i hate how they exploited my emotion for fn and i had never felt safe in school and they just dont care thats psychopathic and i am left with the memory and trauma while they moved on and live their life i feel like i aint allowed to share anything with anyone cause everyone turn it against me unless i am emotionless cant live while every other girl is allowed to smile cry be angry and be cutesy and mentally slow while i have to be constantly aware if someone will attack me i hate how guy tolerate horrible girl yet treated me like trash and ignored me it make it hard to imagine being in a relationship even severe tomboy have more success and they are hated cause my country is traditional and people like me get called trans or lesbian it not internalized mysogyny i just cant smile at guy or feel safe around them and not tremble and yet some guy think making others fear them is some great manly goal how are bully socially popular is beyond mei feel like a low ho for using tinderbadoo cause i dont chase men they are horrible and emotionless but i also felt like the lowest most dirty cheap ho in high school cause the guy i liked wa a womanizwr and i know he wa but i wanted just a friend and to be liked eventually after confessing i felt aawkward and unsafe around him and he did drug and he kissed so many other girl and i just felt unsafe around him and pretended he didnt exist and had no friend for year talking to guy and dating them is a nightmare i want more of a connection and a deep friend rather than bf and just talk to these guy but dont have the intention of being with any of them i am not broken for not wanting to date but my desire to be normal is really big ive become from overly reactive to lethargicoverly slow due to abuse and both are bad cause on one side i am funny when angry on the other i am just quiet and take abuse without defending my self due to being laughed at too much i am tired of people walking over me it like there is a sign on me thats say  please bully me even though i solved my body language my anxiety despite smaller is still clear i hate being firm but i hate how submissive i am just from being told to do stuff i know in boy this kind of weak personality get bullied but even a a fragile girl it make others hate me cause most girl are just evil men with fake nail and big boob and lipstick where i live yet i a tomboy visually who cry a lot and rarely talk wa clearly bad and threat the lgbtq is hated so i wa called third gender but that isnt really the pointguys say they want a submissive housewife but they really want a slave normal girl where i live are mean and sassy and overly confident and egoistic i am more quiet and unconfident but wont be a slave and i guess since i aint pretty some guy say i am but i doubt it guy just hate my personality despite not stealing money or screaming at guy or threatening them guy just dont prefer me which make me insecure they seem to love sissy dumb mean girl that scream and laugh at their joke and clearly cant cook but can have fake nail for a living i dont want to sound narcissitic but a a human being i have so many skill like cooking sawing not related to being a woman and yet i never enough it make me feel like not valuable human being i used to draw a lot but it no longer helpes me i feel angry and frustrated i feel very motherly towards animebook child and very hot and bothered towards anime men hell i even like big awwkard men who cant talk to woman not only confident overpowered maniac but real men make me drier than saharai need to be intelectually stimulated in order to get wet i need to also feel safe to verbally talk dating girl is hard in a lgbtq hating country guy just ask me if i watch anime and thats it a if my whole personality is only anime and i am not a complex human being it why i no longer shar about it with guy they just get weird what i like in guy i dont see in real men visually or in character  what can i do,anxiety

158,what to do when youve gotten bored of livingi dont know why but lately ive just been feeling bored by everything i hate being by myself when im sober and for the past  month have been using pot almost everyday to escape from myselfi have this deep feeling in me like im a prisoner in my own body ive always felt out of place in this world and often just feel like i wasnt meant to be born this year ha been a lot for me mentallyive been admitted twice and i just dont feel like doing life anymore the only way i can stand living is if im under the influence of something im  year old and still live at home cant move out financially i live with my mom and my stepdad my mom is constantly snooping through my room when im not home calling me when im out with my friend asking who i met and what we did i have this weird relationship with my mother because when i wa younger i would tell my mom everything and i would never go out of the house because im kind of shy and didnt have many friend i didnt really start going out until i wa like  year old and thats the first time i tried pot for me trying marijuana wa a big deal because i come from a religious household and always swore when i wa younger that i would never do drug i would only smoke with friend and only when i wa outside so my mom never knew anything however this year my depression got worse and i started smoking more frequently a a coping mechanism eventually i got caught by my mom smoking and for her this wa the biggest deal ever she started calling me a liar saying that if i kept this up i would go to hell and that she would call the policeits ilegal where i live i felt so much shame and guilt because i would tell my mom everything and always do what she told me to do but a i got older i got tired of always having to please people she didnt end up calling the police or kicking me out like she threatened to do she just made me swear that i would never touch weed again and i promised her that by this time i had already been smoking everyday for  month and my mental health had deteriorated so much so that i needed something to escape i started feeling more and more sick of life sick of having to please my mom sick of having to depend on something to make me happystable my mom blamed my friend and said that because i wa around them i had turned in to an addict and a liar she asked me which of my friend smoke and i told her truthfully because i just felt like if i wa honest she wouldnt be so on me all the time but now it gotten worse i still smoke almost everyday because thats what ive gotten used to now my mom always asks when i go out if im going to smoke i say no and do it anyways and end up feeling guilty and shameful because ive lied now ive gotten to the point where im really bored with life and using drug to cope other drug than marijuana and just feel guilt and shame i really dont want to be alive anymore and everyday feel like an endless circle where i have to get up and get through the day when i dont have drug i spend the whole day sleeping and the only thing really keeping me alive is the fact that i feel some kind of obligation towards my mom my mom ha two kid me and my brother none of u have any contact with my brother because he became addicted to drug so my mom and stepdad kicked him out when i wa  year old i used to get sexually abused by my brother but for some reason i didnt say anything about it and kept treating him like usual until he got kicked out and i started getting flashback i remember when i told my mom when i wa twelve year old about what had happened and she wa very dismissive saying that i probably made it up in my head and that it couldnt possibly happened because i didnt say anything for four year she also insinuated that it wa my fault because i used to tell her everything so why didnt i tell her about this i dont know this just became a rant but i feel really indifferent about life and i just cant take the endless cycle anymore i dont really feel like i owe my mom staying alive i mean shes been there for me but more financially than emotionally,anxiety
159,and im so fucking sick of these question it only ever this no inquiry into how im doing or thinking or feeling from my familyfor context  i f have three brother one sister one brother sa my sister and i wa witness to this my sister and i were preteen he wa an adult i wa diagnosed with ptsd just over  year ago i wa surprised to learn that i am a victim too since all that time i just felt tremdenous guilt and had no other explanation or word for what i wa going through eg trigger hypervigilence sleep disturbance etcim lucky to have my sister to lean on and both of u going to therapy to work through each of our experience but damn im amazed at how inconsiderate the rest of my family ha been knowing all of this one of my brother not the abuser who always stress how seriously he take all of this will continue to ask me when my sister andor i will get over this whether we have moved past it and the question always come out of nowhere in our onceinabluemoon phone conversation im caught of guard say something like idk and then switch topic it a disservice to myself because im never prepared for the question and then i spend the next few week ruminating and reliving everything again he and everyone go back to their daytoday life like no problem and here i am just back to square one it feel likei still have to see and communicate with the abuser and he even made himself our dad poa since our dad wa recently diagnosed with cancer ive expressed to everyone that i think the poa should be someone else suggesting it can be one of my other brother of course im the one being difficult and im the one who will probably have to explain why i dont want this person the abuser a the poa and i will probably have to remind everyone that my sister and i have ptsd from this that this shit ha been invading my thought on a daily basis over the last  year i will probably have to share how it always cross my mind when i go to bed at night how i dropped out of college because it all kept coming back and i would freeze during a lecture or an exam that last semester when i stared at the blue book until time ran out and i had to turn it in with only half of one out of three essay question completed i may need to pull together some fact on what trauma doe to a person then draw the dot for them on how i will likely go the rest of my life with disrupted sleep how my life expectancy is reduced ill probably leave out the detail of the time i wake up drenched in sweat andor cry then have to call out of work i cant possibly tell them that my bout of unemployment and consistent financial instability may be a result of this  that would be nut and me not owning up to my own situation right and i wont even bother trying to put word to how it ha impacted my relationshipsso here is a reminder to myself when i get asked this dumb set of question again consider asking do you ever ask the abuser these same question because for fuck sake why dont you put this on him why the fuck are we continuing to live in a world where the victim is solely responsible for their recovery and everyone else ha zero responsibility and zero obligation in that process respond with do you think you will ever get over that this is not how work if it my brother the doctor asking these fucking stupid question again put it in word he can hopefully understand trauma is like an infection the treatment is simple  it talking it out but just like an antibiotic the hard part is that it must be done immediately and continued even after symptom arent present and like in my situation it will spread if left ignored and it will require more effort amp something stronger if treatment keep getting abandoned early but most importantly  it will not heal naturally without intervention and it will get worse through careless picking and probing whoever asks me these question is just seeking reassurance for themselves reassurance that everythings ok and normal and they can go back to their own life without worry this is fine however i shouldnt mistake this for compassion nor a any effort to connect to me  understand my life experience,anxiety

217,im a lone person i do not have any friend ive never had anyone my only friend killed himself when we were  even though ive been with my spouse for  year i still feel all alone because i can not bare to put the weight of my trauma on them without feeling guilty and they could never understand how i feel getting on with itmy recent clinical psychologist i chose them i must say that i do not like them a much a my last therapist who is not a experienced a my clinical psychologist i felt much safer with my first therapist  i could sense them my problem is that with my new psychologist i have constant sexual fantasy about them i find them irresistibly attractive and emotionally attractive i did not choose them because of this in the first place i want to tell them so they can explain whats happening but due to the damage of losing my first therapist and the heartache that caused i am terrified to ask them about it i definitely do not want to disrespect them i value their help so much if i lost them i dont know how id handle it,anxiety
218,today wa pretty bad the work day wasnt so bad but i think after  year of attempting to work thing out with my fiance i dont think i can do it anymore im tired of coming back to some weird coincidence of thing that trigger me and him having to explain sure a a person ha he improved yes like he learned to comfort me and work together through house stuff but what i need is a honest monogamous partner and if he cant do that because of genetics or family trauma or whatever i just wish hed be honest with himself it wasnt always like this our teenage and young adult year were fun a great conversationalist taught me it wa ok to feel talking and bonding over anime comforting each other through each others trauma whenever my sibling would abuse me id call and hed be there when his grandma wa abusing him id be here to comfort he even moved in at  to help take of my dad when all my older sibling didnt care we survived homelessness together some of the thing he did to help me trust himcomforted me when my mom diednot judging my body always standing up for me against bulliesbeing there when i needed a shoulder to cry onprotected me from my abusive sibling when my dad passed when we got into a car accident and the car wa tipped over he pushed me up so the belt didnt hurt me left a job because these two guy at work were pressuring him to go run train on womenamongst other thing i mean from  i wasnt the best partner tbh my undiagnosed ptsd i wa pretty controlling because my previous betrayal trauma from ex that i mentioned in previous post he endured my rage im not proud of it and i havent hit him but a a teen i used to hit him a a way to show hey you wronged me dont fuck with me he didnt have to wait around for me to realize what i wa doing wa fucked up but he did i thought maybe u both going to couple therapy would be enough that maybe u coming to the conclusion we had untreated trauma part of his being he wa never taught to communicate properly because he wa always told to be quiet of his opinion doesnt matter and thats why maybe he looked at other woman on some random image board all those year ago because i had freaked out one time we were being intimate while half asleep and called him a rapistnot smart i know and i totally understand if anyone bag on me but i wa startled and it wasnt ok to do that and i thought maybe it wa just he internalized that and so he didnt feel comfortable anymore expressing sexual need to me but after today i just am tired of the cycle of good and then i get this gut feeling somethings wrong or ill look at something on his phone and itll seem wrong im tired of the excuse i want to be in a relationship thats healthy for me and i want to be happy today he wa looking at something on his phone but it seemed like he wa slightly turning it away note that we have a open policy of me being able to look through his phone but when i grabbed it to look through it looked like he wa looking to download snap chat now no one would think this is weird but a of  month ago we lost all of our friend due to one main friend going through a divorce and thing getting toxic with everyone also snap chat is not necessarily a porn site but hey i do know people add randos and post their only fan neither one of u have snapchat we just have fb and reddit but just the way he freaked out and tried to grab the phone reminded me of the night i found the nude picture of other woman it just seemed guilty he even seemed defensive when i questioned him angrythen going on with cry begging me to talk to him that he didnt want to fight saying shit like why would i spend all these year in therapy alone just to hurt you why would i try to go to couple therapy if i didnt want to be with you idk man maybe to create a false sense of security for me maybe because you dont want to admit you dont want me anymore because we dont have friend and your family toxic and so is mine so you dont wanna go homeless again or live awkwardly with an ex till we figure it out im just in so much pain and trying so hard to be strong and fight for me i didnt want to turn  and be single but i dont want to live a lie anymore and maybe im seeing certain post on fb for a reason like the one that say dont keep your boyfriend to lose out on your husband meaning just because youve been with a man a long time doesnt mean it meant to be or whatever i know itll be very hard for me to date because welli have ptsdtrust issue body dysmorphia im in my si like nerdy thing like anime and im demisexual meaning i can only have sex with you if i have a deep emotional connection to you i just dont think after this little stunt i can take anymore ive been with m for  year i just wish at least he could be a man and say hey im not into this or you but let be friend and support each other at least i could respect him more that way i dont know all of the demon m is battling but i do know some thats why i cant entirely bring myself to totally hate him i value the friendship we had and that we could talk or do anything but that mean nothing if he cant be a monogamous honest man to me i know his dad wasnt around and cheated on his mom i know he wa verbally and physically abused by his uncle and grandma his mom didnt even try to parent him and only came back into his life when he wa  but the bitch is a meth head and on food stamp but she never fed him properly im just going on and on i just dont immediately want people to scream about how m is a d bag without knowing his pain too im tired and just really triggered idk guy what do i do follow my gut and leave somehow live on my own even though i only make  an hour and have to commute  min to the same job a m sighi wish this wasnt happening,anxiety
219,so my last roommate wa a friend who at first wa a good roommate but became very toxic when their mental health went down she would yell at me all the time wanted to know where i wa wanted to spend every second with me i would have to spend hour cleaning id have to cook or else they wouldnt eat and depend on me anytime they needed to go somewherei been living alone for almost a year now and been in weekly therapy when my old roommate left me and my neighbor became friend cause her ex gf moved out around the same time she been a good friend and we opened up to each other she know most of what happened with my old roommate she work in healthcare and i opened up i have anxiety and adhd i hinted at agoraphobia and depression yesterday we talked about moving in together when her lease is up in august she understands i have trust issue with living with someone and answered all my question she seems like a good fit but im worried that like i have to like warn her of my ptsd like on bad day ill spend hour cry and having panic attack living alone i didnt really have to hide that for a while should i like warn her she work in mental health and mentioned before she doesnt want to come home to a mental crisis every night and it not every night and it wouldnt be her problem i just know from my old roommate hearing someone cry in their room can be hard to listen to,anxiety
220,im also asking in other sub that might be better suited but honestly im desperate half a decade ago i very dramatically fell out with my best friend and i have never spoken to her again context is that we were friend all through school had a lot of traumatic thing happen to u in that time that i wont specify usually in each others company trauma bond i guess in hindsight she had a lot of mental illness i wa then undiagnosed with most of what i now know myself to have for the first year after we split i became an insomniac from the depression then other life stuff came up and sort of trumped it in term of importance grief and relationship so i moved on maybe  year ago she reached out and attempted to apologise it read more like something her therapist or rehab told her to write and that she wa digging for an apology from me i ignored her because at the time i wa neck deep in grief over losing some family member and after the initial curiosity the interaction actually just made me angry my own mother begged me not to engageever since then for literally year she ha pretty much been in my dream every single night it wa sporadic at first now it relentless theyre not nightmare shes just present weve either made up or were on and off or shes just around it frankly infuriating i had just started to heal and move on focus on dealing with other thing like grieving family member and growing my business and it like she sent me backwards i even tried checking in on her social once to see if it would scratch whatever itch my brain seemed to be labouring under but it just made it worse now shes more realistic i never think about her in my waking life  i wouldnt even say i hate her that much anymore i just dont care about her and after dealing with a lot of trauma and loss i prefer to only give energy to people i really care about thats why it so infuriating for her to be in my dream so much especially since most character in my dream are usually imaginary it jarring to have this one real person appear constantly when it usually so rarei dont know anyone have any advice on how to deal with this ive considered going back to therapy again but it feel so stupid to do it over this i just need it to stop,anxiety
221,it been nearly  year since the event that triggered my ptsdi have developed my coping method i have friend ive attended and graduated university im in grad school now and overall i wa relatively okay with my life nothing wa perfect but i wa copinguntil i realized that a im in love with my best friend and b i am completely incapable of entering into a relationship it wasnt until i fell in love and contemplated dating that i realized just how much conscious effort go into coping every single day and just how fragile the stability i rely on is i really thought i had come to term with everything but this just sting i know he deserves so much better than what i can give him and im coming face to face with the potential reality that the price of stability is relative solitude a few year ago i fell into deep depression while trying to process that this is something ill probably be dealing with for the rest of my life and after i got through it i thought that i wa over accepting my diagnosis and what had happenedbut this is just so absolutely fing garbage,anxiety
222,im extremely scared to go to a hospital im currently  year old and have such severe cptsd ive been having homicidal ideation about my class mate and how i just want to be done with it and i know i need intensive care but i still live with my mom and i know she would have a mental break down if i went to a mental hospital she know i dont feel good and that i need mental help but she ha no idea about how much help i actually need but my school is making it worse and every time i set foot or talk to my teacher i feel horrible and angry because they dont seem to care i feel like i have to hide my emotion from my teacher or else i will be locked up i dread going to school everyday but i feel like i can say anything without getting locked up,anxiety
223,i f wa having a bad day usually my symptom are mostly panicken in my head but my mind learned to shut off ny body sensation for the most part yesterday i went nauseous and then got a sting and pressure on my chest googled it and had some more symptom im not at high risk for a hart attack so i thought it must be in ny head and tried to calm down but it didnt work hesitated for  more minute and called an ambulance  guy show up and  asked me if he could put the electrode on my body while the other one asked me about my health i told him i have ptsd but are otherwise healthy told him it from dv and some other stuff he stopped emidiatly and asked if it wa really ok to touch me and if i wa uncomfortable at any time he would stop he kept talking to me about ptsd and he clearly knew a lot about it and what it can do to the body they did every test in the book and even when they would want to consult a third he asked my permission and kept explaining how safe and anonymous it wa they came up with a bunch of reason why i could have those symptom and explained it all once i calmed down a bit the man looked at me and asked what wa still te matter because he could see i wa holding back tear i told him i wa a bit embarrassed they came out for nothing and started to cry they assured me i did the right thing and it wa no problem at all he then said that is also must be uncomfortable to have  strange men in your house in your situation it wa all so comforting and without judgement and after half an hour they left and told me if any symptom arise again dont hesitate to call again im really glad these  men were well educated in mental health and comforting peoplei just wanted to share a positive story since i see so many people here who are met with judgement or clearly dont know how to talk to people with ptsd and these werent even mental health professionalsyou all take care and the best of luck,anxiety
224,currently im trying to get better however im in a school program that is supposed to be for helping people with trauma and emotional issue but they are making everything worse everytime i go to school something trigger my trauma and my teacher dont seem to care they take me into another room to talk to me and just tell me to calm down im afraid to tell them anything because i feel like im going to be locked up for telling them my feeling yes my feeling are violent and i do want to kill people but it because my mental health is so bad that i can barely function,anxiety
225,here me out please i understand there a term called transference and usually im able to somewhat resist feeling emotionally attached to my therapist but after i suggested if we could model a relationship i realised  i started to  actually get attached to my therapist i went away on a trip and i couldnt stop thinking about her or wishing to hear her voice even like googling her or hearing an interview of her her voice really calmed me down im embarrassed over this i didnt tell her this part it a if my brain after discussing to model a relationship pulled down it barrier to actually be attached for real during the trip thinking of her made me feel safe i felt so anchored today is the first day after quite a while i confessed to my therapist im attached to her she wa understanding and said you are in an acknowledging way i wa shocked she knew and plenty embarrassed but she wa kind said it a start to learn  but now that im home at night i am freaking out im frightened and want to scream and run away this isnt fine because of all the people not someone who cant reciprocate because it inappropriate i dont trust myself to be able to just fake a relationship to learn what if i get confused she wa understanding and said this is a start after i told her in a terrified voice that this wa wrong like  she cant be attached to me too and though logically i know why that thought make me want to avoid altogether i know therapist cant be attached because then they cant treat their client properly but it hurt for the first time to think of this it feel solonely im scaredfor a long time im able to differentiate and built a very thick barrier between my attachment issue and my therapist because i knew i might end up feelign attached but nowidk if this is a good or bad thing im fucking scared and wish i didnt feel or is a normal part of learning how to feel attached to relationship something we lacked a child is this seriously what relationship are aboutthere is an upcoming appointment with her and the supervisor a theyre both treating me for different thingscomplicated but it work and my ptsd is making me terrified to be in the same room a two older adult even though i too am a freaking adult urgh emotion basically some time back there wa a day i dissociated and felt mumb from my emotion suddenly and i ever since that day ive been wishing not to feel a emotion are so so complicated today wa a good day yet after therapy i internally started freaking out how can i convince myself this fake relationship can work is this even fake idk i know we can model a relationship but for the therapist theyre probably used to it but for client theyre a lot more vulnerable arent they how do ihow do i differentiate,anxiety

232,ive been thinking about this for week and im pretty scared to post this but if im not safe to challenge my fear in this community where is safe im someone who is pretty terrified about asking for help setting boundary or causing any type of conflict  so this might come across a pretty disjointed it fawning symptom and fear please be gentle and patient if you have the capacity the tldr is the bold section but im afraid if i edit the qualifying context statement out it will come off wrong im trying to be nice fair respectful and show that ive given this a lot of thoughtive noticed lately that there are a lot of people coming into the sub who maybe arent diagnosed with actual full blown ptsd and trauma dumping their painful story im finding it really triggering and maybe others are too if it wa just a trigger i would try to process it but it more than that it sort of give me the ick i feel sort of used and maybe a little exploited although i think thats a bit of a strong word  i cant think of the proper term for exploitation lite i believe people with ptsd are very compassionate and emotionally giving people when we are in a good space we know genuine human suffering very well and dont want others to suffer that being said i dont think this is the appropriate place for every single human who ha experienced life trauma to bilk sympathy and validation from damaged people we arent roffmychest or rmentalhealth or rtraumatoolbox or rtraumaticchildhood a the sidebar say we are a supportive respectful community for discussion and link of interest for people who have ptsd or have friend family member or partner with ptsd i know it say those who have not those who may have all over the place a i type this even a banner above where you type the title i get that the mod team is trying to make it clear i feel like the normal world put too much emphasis on the trauma part of the name and ignores the stress disorder part of the name im getting exhausted explaining the difference over and over and i feel like we already face enough misunderstanding and stigma from the outside world it doesnt feel so much like a safe container for people who already haveunderstand the disorder and their loved one i want to share my energy struggle experience etc with a community of peer i need a place to recharge when the rest of the world drain me a place where people understand if that make sense the constant validation seeking is just so much more of a burden and a drain it like standing on the line of diagnosis seeking if someone ha diagnosed ptsd then whatever the trauma it is obviously enough to cause ptsd because it about symptom over time the stress disorder from a damaged nervous system not the trauma that caused it a mental health professional isnt going to just hand out the diagnosis willy nilly but i feel some of the people posting in here are looking for validation to self diagnose and playing fast and loose with the rule this doesnt apply to people who have the diagnosed disorder but feel guilty or like their trauma isnt that bad compared to others thats not what im trying to say at all  i hope most people will be charitable enough to admit theyve spotted the difference tooto the community is anyone else feeling the same way or am i just being over sensitive should we maybe stop giving them attention unless they state they are diagnosed even mental health professional need to protect themselves from vicarious trauma how do we do the same in this subto the mod is there any way to add a mandatory flair system ex ptsdfriendfamily if that is too invasive and private maybe a new rule must have medically diagnosed not self diagnosed  ptsd to post trauma venting so that we can at least have a reason to reportask for the validation seeking post to be removed is there any way to make it a little more comfortable for the actual ptsd community and a little le comfortable for those just seeking trauma validation not that people dont deserve validation for traumatic event just maybe this isnt the place and we arent the appropriate people to ask because it sort of insensitive and entitled sorry for the wall of text im super fedup and i over explain when i have high anxiety about being misunderstood or causing confrontation also have adhd that make it worse maybe there is nothing that can reasonably be done and i just needed to vent if anyone actually read this  thank you any kind and constructive feedback is appreciated,anxiety
233,this is partly a vent and partly looking for advice some context needed i  have dealt with mental health issue my whole life but when i brought it up to my parent during my teenage year it wa due to bad influence or demon or well i guess im just a bad parent so i stopped talking about it they assume it went away i think fast forward tenish year and now im dealing with ptsd clinically diagnosed ptsd and now my parent is acting like i am too unstable to be making good decision for myself thankfully theyre still leaving it in my hand but being very vocal about itdecisionwise i feel fine but theyre treating me like im some dangerously unstable person and doubting my every decision some thing that have been said well if it were up to me youd be seeing a therapist in person stop taking these med theyll kill you i dont trust you now that you didnt tell me you were taking med youre obviously unstable so you cant judge whats good for you let me judge whats good for you these med are not good for you just do edmr youll be better in  week i did my research i trust my psychiatrist there no way i will be ready for edmr that soon it could take me a year to establish that kind of trust with my therapist im just your adult child dealing with trauma i need you to treat me like im an adult capable of making my own decision ive been fine so far but a i expected after i told you im seeing a therapist and got a diagnosis and got med youre still trying to push me in the direction you think is right well ill just shut up since you obviously dont want to hear my opinion no i do but i only want to hear it once god am i actually going crazy would i know if i wasi want to go this alone without unnecessary opinion is it really that crazy to trust my own judgement for my treatment,anxiety

240, here im currently visiting my parent stepfather and mum they have been together since  the earliest time i remember them fighting is when i wa  year oldi always saw them drinking and i do not live with them i moved back to my grandparent house in  my great grandmother offered to pack my bag since she wa visiting me i took the offer of course after seeing them drink and fight all the time there wa this one instance where my stepfather pushed my mother down a flight of stair and i witnessed her cry and hurt on the floor they try to be sober for me now and there time i question whether i should move back with them or stay here it too hard when they lie about not drinking and it confuses me i can tell when someone is drunk my stepfather and my mom would get drunk and he would get aggressive and start going on a fullass rampage around the house destroying a few furniture and then hurting my mom physically this ha been going on until a few year and now they have been sober for many month but my mum relapsed in december i feel so bad for not trusting them but they lied to me all the time and still do today we went to an arcade and my mum had to get mean with my stepdad idk if they were drinking or not im so tired of people blaming me for my trauma i tried confronting my mom and asked her if we can go home she kept getting aggressive and i bought something for my game over there my mum wa trying to help me set it up on her phone and i saw mean text message from my stepdad my mum kept denying it when i wa trying to ask her why she and my stepdad are fighting again she proceeds to continuesly tell me to play some game at the arcade with her and i kept saying no because i wa panicking and i wanted to go home and she said to me to stop making other people problem your problem how am i supposed to gnome the fact that you guy are fighting and it probably will get more worse then that i dont wanna see them fight in the car i lashed out at them i shouldnt have done that for the first time ever my stepdad proceeds to say that my trauma wa minor and it nothing compared to what gangster experience so they know that they caused me to get trauma from them getting into physical fight and just all the immature argument i just hate thinking that whenever people are fighting ill proceed to think that it will get physical from now on im so nauseous and my mum want to come with me back home to my grandparent i doubt that cause she said in the car that she wa gonna leave my stepfather i know damn well thats not true im sorry for not trusting you guy but you have always lied to me many time  my grandparent are gonna pick me up  just so you know i would like to state thati have experienced other traumatic event that happened to me thank you for whoever is reading this i hope you heal from your trauma aswell,anxiety

244,tw physical abuseidont understand whats happening to me suddenly i mid s woman used to have really bad anxiety and wa told i have severe ptsd although i did not feel like it wa severe my trauma come from my childteen year but ive been fine for year nowa couple month ago i wa with someone i know and trust and for some reason after they did something mildly hurtful that we dealt with and they apologized everything wa good but there wa some unrecognized anxiety and weird feeling sneaking up throughout the night it came to a head when i wa drunk not black out and had somehow concluded this person wa going to kill me which they absolutely were not going to i booked it out of a moving vehicle twisted my ankle and ran into the wood in an area with lot of bear and other stuff but thats how convinced i wa that this person wa gearing up to murder me it took me hour to snap out of itand usually im a happy drunk  and i dont drink that often so i dont think it wa the alcohol fast forward to this week i had some issue out of my control with someone i care deeply about and it caused me a lot of anxiety and frustration in a sad not angry way i am in control of my word and action to others but when i freaked out if you can even call it that i tug at my shirt collar broke some necklace on accident and somehow clawed at my neck and left long bloody scratch on my collarbone most of my ptsd come from my brother and he used to try strangle me amp stuff so it make me weird about having thing around my neck i guess im just looking for insight or direction i dont want it to get worse i put myself in a very dangerous situation when i had the ptsd attack thanks for reading,anxiety
245,im f and have been deconstructing a lot in my life one of those thing is the idea that of course id have kid why wouldnt i well im now allowing myself to actually ask if thats what i want and ive decided id like some advice and to hear your experiencesim not sure i want kid but not because i dont want kid i really like the idea of raising kid and having a family but i dont really like child id rather deal with  and more importantly im very unsure i want to put myself through pregnancy and young kidsi have concern that pregnancy hormone will cause my symptom to become erratic ive had episode where i go from stable to extreme self harm i am concerned that i will not be able to have the patience to deal with small child under normal stresslevel day like being overstimulated with noise i can become very verbally aggressive and when i am angry and overwhelmed emotionally i have had a serious desire to physically hurt people or throw thing around me and considering a baby alone pretty much scream and cry all day and i struggle just to keep my emotion under control im not sure i am capable of raising child without causing serious emotional or mental damage what kind of person would i be to bring kid into a home with an unstable mom who may have serious ptsd episode and not be the consistent loving patient parent most strive to be and im not talking your average jane trying her best im talking someone who doesnt work constant med and therapy weekly because im that roughnow i know i am young but my husband really want at least one kid and im not sure if i actually want them or not due to all these complexity so people whove gone through pregnancy and have moderate to severe ptsd and have had kid how did you make the decision to have kid what ha it been like symptom wise with your young kid have any fear youve had come true ie fear youll have an anger outburst and take it out on your kid what have the effect of your symptom been on your kidsyour marriage if you could go back would you still decide to have kidsi appreciate anybody who took the time to read all of this and respond i apologize that it is long,anxiety
246,for a few year now ive been really considering putting myself out there in dating apps nobody really want me in real life  maybe they do i just dont feel attracted to them in return although they do come off nicely but mostly scared  of me because i wa in position of leadership i had already been suffering from some milder ptsd from childhood trauma and various sexual assault trauma at the time and potentially csa which i didnt remember until recently which wa something that had warped my entire sense of being and purpose  i had always felt like a sexual object to be touched and used from a very young age i had  have never been in a relationship before mostly because i feared men and the violence of men for a long time i developed and wa diagnosed with more intense ptsd in  after a rpe ive been with many men in bed since but im starting to feel really tired of letting myself be used by men who wont give two fuck about me and vice versa it feel really empty and i really crave for something real that is emotionally fulfilling i want to be loved and wanted emotionally by someone not just lust  for my body but i still carry really negative view about myself and sometimes the world ive been on tinder lately and have been talking to someone that initially wanted a fwb thing from me which i said no those type of empty relationship werent what i wa looking for anymore that i had eventually opened up to we were talking about trauma or how i got into casual sex or something and revealed my sexual trauma a the reason why he probed and i explained in better detail i said i wa felt really lonely he said that if i got into a relationship before i fully healed from my trauma and undid the negative cognition i carried i would only be loving someone because i wa lonely and would not be genuine and that my partner would feel like he wa being used and that he would feel burdened  obligated to stay to help me feel better a i worked through my own trauma i asked if genuinely loving someone and curbing loneliness with someone could be not mutually exclusive and he said no since the basis of the relationship would be that i still sought the person out of loneliness in the first place he also said i needed to learn how not to trauma dump to not burden anyone who considering being with me  is with me i am actively in therapy and he is aware since then he ha suggested to me to be in an ethical nonmonogamous enm relationship for starter said it would bring me emotional fulfilment while not requiring the full commitment of a polygamous relationship i said i wa considering it not a a starting point but i wa just open to it in general but felt deterred to participate because most of the men that were nonmonogamous that were trying to get with me were probably cheating on their partner because they needed it to be discreet he then revealed himself to be having a longterm partner who he wa practicing enm with like she wa aware that he wa seeking other woman and she probably wa seeking other men too i cant help but feel like this is all just a ploy to get sex from me like even if we started going on date it all just to take advantage of sex a a reward he a smart and wellspoken guy i admire his intelligence but it also worry me that he may use it to manipulate me to engaging in an enm relationship with him he already is trying to know me better and ha expressed interest in getting into one with me if we vibe well which we kind of having been going in the direction of am i only deserving of an enm relationship at this juncture of my healing and not a monogamous one would i only be using a partner to curb loneliness instead of loving him genuinely would i be burdening them with my traumatised self i dont know anymore,anxiety

265,in  when i wa fourteen my best friend chloe killed herself we were online friend but closer than most irl friendship i had we talked everyday for hour and hour and would even think about dating we almost did for a bit i really loved her and she wa my whole world i wa the one she said her last word to or text ig and she texted me while she did it after she died i didnt really get support my therapist brushed me off because i wa getting support for another issue and due to my toxic masculinity thats the only way i can describe it im afab but demigirl i didnt talk to anyone about it in fear of being weak i guess i cant really remember but at the start i just continued like nothing happened i feel like  deep down  i mightve killed her the thing is it wasnt just her suicide that traumatized me when i wa growing up my parent wonderful amazing people  they were always completely loving to me and gave me everything i could possibly want  didnt even make me do chore but would make me feel so so guilty about the privilege i had i know this sound stupid since they were so nice but they made me feel awful with thing they said like you dont know how good you have it they made me feel like a monster because i had ocdanxiety a a kid and couldnt accommodate their need i had agoraphobia and couldnt go outside while they were adventurous people they always tried their best to help me but i remember feeling like a spoiled stupid kid and my mom cry loudly in the next room because of mebeing blamed for it due to this  even though this sound awful  i seeked trauma id see all my friendspeople online with horrible story and i felt so  guilty for them i felt a if i needed trauma to make the guilt go away so when chloe wa texting me about to do it i wa happy i wa happy and hoping shed die because that meant i would finally be enough ik that sound so awful she wa still my best friend and her death absolutely shattered me but what if super deep down im happy about this sometimes i think i couldnt live with the guilt if she hadnt died it only helped a little the guilt is so bad i cant function sometimes sometimes i wish to be abused or awful thing to happen to me because i feel like i deserve it maybe i didnt help chloe the way i shouldve because i wanted it to happen she only did it because she ha bpd and i told her i didnt want to date her she said i lead her on but i didnt realize so it wa my fault she died because of me and everyone that knew her is going to have a horrible life because of me because i wa selfish because i couldnt handle the guilt and be a good person like i always wanted to be so badly after she died i had no friend but i guess that is karma it been  year and i still have no friend nobody can compare ig when my parent come in to check on me i feel physically ill how could they do that to me how could god let me have goodness like that while others suffer i want to never talk to them again because i deserve the suffering of having no parent like others another thing i want to get off my chest before i go after she died my new friend had a suicide crisis and i had to stop them successfully this time lol so i think that contributed to my ptsd if i even have it i am angry at them for for everything i want to puke,anxiety

270,i am reaching out to reddit because im out of option my husband and i just recently came out of an extremely traumatic event a few month ago a a result of that event it ha caused my husband ptsd from his death experience a a child my husband died when he wa one a a result of his mother negligence and abuse he wa dead for  minute he wa resuscitated but his mother decided to not take him to the hospital a a result of that experience and what he saw during his death it ha resurfaced with far more intensity than in the past  he is afraid to do anything this includes doing even the most basic thing such a going out and taking care of himself because a he put it whats the point and his suicidal ideation ha increased i know he is suffering from depression a a result of the traumatic event from  month ago but his comment have become increasingly concerning after doing research on database throughout my schooling i am a psychology major currently halfway through my bachelor with a focus on art therapy and interest in parapsychology and speaking with expert and doctor we have come to a somewhat mutual agreement that his ptsd from his childhood abuse and death experience ha resulted in death anxiety or a fear around dying death and the concept of an afterlife the problem is that with living in the u there is no treatment option available for this type of anxiety not even cbt  cognitive behavioral therapy specialized is offered he ha begun to become more recluse and when he is ok talking about it it lead to spiral about how he would be better off attempting now and forgoing everything than just waiting for the inevitable i am keeping an eye on him i just dont want to loose my best friend more than his ptsd and depression have taken a hold on him or at the very least be there at the end of the spiral waiting to help him doe anyone know any good resource study or treatment that aid in death anxiety,anxiety

459,i think i must have a pretty heavy history of sexual assault and abuse i struggle to put my experience into context with what others have experienced hence the qualifier of i think my first memory of sexually inappropriate activity wa when i wa  i wa in school playing cop and robber boy v girl small town school in canada for population reference the boy were the cop the girl were the robber and the chained baseball diamond wa jail i remember most prominently one boy making the rule then aggressively holding the girl to the fence with their hand above their head to look down their shirt the boy wa my neighbor and we had been babysat by the same person another neighbor who had a daughter a year younger than u just u three kid the part that scare me is that i remember having a dream around this time about being held down and molested or raped by alien i also remember wanting the boy to chase me and being jealous when he hurt and looked at the other girl i drank for the first time with this same boy he touched me and kissed me while i told him to stop he wa my first kiss on a prior occasion having dared me to do it i have other traumatic experience with boy other than this particular boy but he is notable because we were close until around age  in highschool me and this boy didnt spend time together i wa experiencing my first abusive boyfriend who wouldnt let me talk to anyone else using my history of neglect to his advantage with the threat of emotional abandonment gaslight lighting and threat of revenge porn the boy i wa babysat with wa into drinking and weed with the popular kid it somehow got around to me that he told everyone we were sibling i think a girl who otherwise thought she wa too cool to talk to me asked if it wa true he would always stop me to check in if i looked upset and he made public complaint about my boyfriend treating me in a suspicious way after he touched me when we drank together at age  i associated the idea of any physical contact with him a repulsive notable is that i had this feeling towards contact with my parent and sister a well so it didnt stand out to me im mostly clarifying that i had no romantic interest in this boy next is the topic of neglect my family parent and two older sister never seemed to care about me ive always felt distant from them often burdensome my mother wa sick when i wa young which left her brain damaged and my father mentally ill i have never had a relationship with any of them family gathering were something i watched from behind glass figuratively speaking an experience that i justified to myself a the result of being at least  year younger than everyone in my immediate and extended family my generation cousin and sister are all girl everyone meet a boy when they were between the age of  and got married by  because of this i think i told myself i needed a husband to save myself from social isolationi do not have a husband at  i wa raped and beaten and abused by my second boyfriend at  i wa living in my car because my second boyfriend wa released to his own recognizance after he wa caught by a friend of ours and a neighbor beating me and then dragging me down the street to kill me after i escaped out the back door during an attack he had put his name on my house and my name on his car he maxed out every source of credit i had on crystal meth and heroin  month after i bought my first house he stalked me a fact i wa aware of because his dad told me i needed to be careful if i wa ever alone he did find me once parked by the lake near my parent house after that and chased me in his car i drove to the police station and no one did anything to protect mei paid a lawyer to convince my second boyfriend to let me sell my house which wa the only way to get the house out of our shared legal possession i paid off his car when he stopped making payment and the bank came after me i paid off his legal fee for assaulting me after he put a lean on my house for legal aid i wa left with ten of thousand of dollar in debt then covid hit i moved in with my third boyfriend and my family isolated so hard i never heard from them or saw them i have paid off my debt gone back to school to advance my career bought a new house and i am objectively successful from a capitalistic view point the thing i have neglected is my mental health christmas brought up a lot of feelingsfirst of all im sick of feeling guilty for not having a relationship with my family they didnt try to have a relationship with me when i wa young suicidal and very obviously struggling my parent always seemed to catch me and make me feel like a failure if i stepped out of line but they never interact with me enough to either punish me or to teach me i never felt noticed cared for or loved i felt dirty and hated now my family make me feel overwhelming guilt when i dont go to family event even though they forget to invite me half the time last family reunion i went to my aunt made snide comment that it wa nice of me to show up i work full time in emergency health care that ha been my only excuse for missing an occasion who criticizes someone for that i went to a small church service christmas eve to support my parent in the choir my boyfriend came after the service i go to hug my dad and he point out that the boy i wa baby sat with is there our parent are close i am not resilient enough to manage reminder of abuse at large social gathering i panicked in high school i hugged a lot that is when i last knew this guy so i hugged him my current boyfriend know the story ive written here he wa standing with me when i hugged this guy and became so angry he is a good person so anger mostly look like taking personal space but he did yell at me and leave me alone on christmas i dont think i need to feel guilty about hugging the guy i think i need emotional support so that the next time im faced with a situation i feel comfortable enough to respect my boundary and keep my personal space open i feel so guilty that the only time i saw my parent for christmas wa to hug them christmas eve and run but i am managing unbearable emotion i wouldnt be so crappy and volatile with my emotion if literally anyone ever showed me support and love im sick of feeling like everything is my fault,anxiety

489,hey just looking for support ive had a rough go of itfor context here is a brief summary to explain the related trauma for this part of my ptsd when i wa  or  year old i went on a trip to europe with my father and stepmother they have a history of abusing each other and me but my family had not accepted it at the point in time this story take place i insisted that i did not want to go but my mom told me that i should go because they bought a ticket and it would be fun so i wentthey didnt rent a car with enough seat for everybody it wa a hatchback suv but we had  kid and should have gotten a mini van they said wed have to take turn having one kid in the trunk at a time andi thought it sounded funny and would be a fun story to tell my friend so i offered to go first however we didnt end up taking turn it wa a  week long road trip across europe and i spent probably upwards of  hour in the trunk of the car and they started refusing to allow me out like stopping at an atm but refusing to allow me to get my own money out so they refused to open the trunk and i wa trapped at one point we were on the autobahn in germany i wa in the trunk and scared because i knew it wasnt safe for me to be in the trunk if we were to get into an accident and i had a panic attack and begged them to slow down and my stepmother laughed and told my dad to speed up she always wanted to prove dad loved her the most shes really sick in the headultimately at a hotel in europe i begged them to let me go home to my mother to drop me off at an airport so i could fly back to america i told them id jump out of the hotel window from the second story if they wouldnt let me go home i thought theyd care if i threatened to hurt myself like theyd understand how much theyd hurt me and how scared i wa instead my father refused and they left me at the hotel alone and with no money of my own while they went on a day trip to another part of italy for more than  hoursi eventually made it home and went nc a bit laterthis is ultimately the culminating incident that really sparked my ptsd although i know it really built up from all the other abuse during my childhood this wa just the worst it wa actually one of my first reddit post begging for helpsince then l cannot go somewhere without my own transportation or way out if im in a car and need to stop to use the restroom or something and the driver refuse i have actively attempted to throw myself out of a moving vehicle because my fight or flight kick in and i panic my family know this it my main triggermy mom planned a christmas trip and i reminded her i cannot go anywhere if i dont have an escape route or reliable mean of transportation we talked about this repeatedly and she told me id have unrestricted access to a rental car any time i needed it well we are here now she went shopping earlier in the day and returned we were supposed to go out for dinner but they changed their mind i asked if i could go get some fresh air just run to walmart or something because i needed to get out she laughed said no and told me it wa a big car and the road are windy so she doesnt want me to drive itfor the record my mom doesnt typically even make the effort to drive an hour to visit me ive driven from pennsylvania to texas more than a dozen time on my own roughly  hour each way and through yellowstone and up pike peak im in my mid s i can fucking handle the roadsshit is already rough this year now im just in the bedroom panicking and upset because i feel trapped she promised me id be able to leave and then completely blew me off i told my mom we could talk about safety concern but she violated my boundary because i made it very clear i needed access to a vehicle due to having ptsd my aunt then compared me to my  year old cousin who ha oppositional defiance disorder and autism im not trying to say those diagnosis are insult but im an adult woman with a home and career that i independently maintain and he is a teenaged boy in an alternative education program because his behavior is too reckless to be around other childrenthats it thats the post im just really upset and i just hope to share this with others who may understand,anxiety

her and i regret trusting her again because i know it wa the downfall of not only me but u i have been a fucking mess since cutting off all communication with her last november shes been making new number and email to contact me ive felt so harassed while just trying to heal from the trauma she took all of my self worth and confidence away with her and i hated myself for ever allowing her in my life again the fact that she affected u and him made the feeling so much worse my insecurity manifested into reality in my head and i couldnt stop it we were in florida away from all other family with bill we couldnt afford three pet to take care of one car and struggling to make end meet the stress wa eating me alive he helped me with some aspect of healing and always tried so hard to just be defeated again i felt angry that i couldnt be normal and he couldnt fully help and didnt realize it at the time that i took it out on him saying he wasnt doing enough telling him i feel so alone all the time and everythings crushing me my insecurity and feeling of worthlessness eventually transferred to him needing constant reassurance being a nuisance not being able to believe i deserved love since my own parent didnt we got new job in november previously working together cleaning vacation rental he got a retail job working ampm and i worked remote customer service ampm we had no time together the time spent wa full of exhaustion from u both we werent fully there for one another and my condition worsened quickly ive struggled with suicidal thought and ideation for a long time and in mid november i tried to down a bottle of pill he caught me freaked out and wanted to call the police i wish he wouldve i wish i got the help i needed then but i puked them up he wa traumatized from it and i felt stuck in the guilt but it wa right back to work bill stress panic attack the argument got stronger the feeling got more intense and we were both just begging the other person to hear or understand i understood his side and felt immense guilt but i always felt like he didnt understand my side i eventually lost my job i had several panic attack during call and my anxiety wa becoming crippling and no callno showed until they requested the equipment back he wa getting me a job at his workplace since we had the one car he said he would ask about the job in person rather than me calling a couple day prior in those couple day others were hired for the position i wouldve had and when they said they wouldnt be hiring until the first of january it wa already december th i went into a full fledged anxiety attack and started saying hurtful thing why would you get my hope up for this we cant afford to move in two week supposed to be moving the week after christmas and now i

turned into fighting with everything i had in me and being okay if i died in that moment because i would go out screaming biting stabbing shooting kicking punching i would put my all into it i quite literally wouldnt go down without a fight but during those moment when bullet were flying or blade were slashing the adrenaline felt good like i couldnt die that i wa invincible my fighting got a technique to it my movement became fluid and instantaneous it felt so free letting every part of me fight with no limit no pressure just life or death win or lose no school no abusive parent no rape

520,warning if anyone is triggered by sa hit the back button ill start with my backstory of what caused my ptsd in march  i wa sa while working on a route with usps im in the usa and this is our post office systemi went through hell with everything the offender wa convicted and sentenced it wa all over the local news station newspaper and social medium all the detail of their conviction wa followed so i had to reexperience it over and over throughout the process including testifying but i think the way i wa treated by my job had more to do with my ptsd than anything i wa having panic attack and dissociation and night terror all the stuffmy agency wa of no help whatsoever they put me through hell going a far a to giving me a predisiplinary interview and including my sa a one of the safety issue being addressed this wa after i sprained my ankle and cut my knee open they have to list three time youve been hurt and thats the only thing they could use for an incidentyou might wonder why i wa still working there well frankly i wa in shock and numb i had also just bought a new car and had no help in the way of management i thought i couldnt afford it i needed money and they had no problem taking advantage i wa even asked to come in after a hearing in court yathings eventually got worse and i filed a workman compensation claim and took off work this time i left for  year in this time i needed to clean my life up i developed a severe drinking problem so i went to rehab and started doing the real work i wanted my job back for principal i felt like it wa a shred of what my life wa before ptsd that i could control i went back and transitioned into a route that wa pretty safe but i kept having issue with my ptsd and missed work a lot from night sweat and the sleep disturbance med didnt help if stress wa too high i managed  year back when thing came to a real turning point last christmas i couldnt sleep for day i wa stressed at work and triggered by some thing therei had a seizure on christmas while my family wa opening present it wa caused by sleep disruption and my medication lowered my threshold for seizure but i had been on that med   year my psychiatrist had been wanting me to quit my job for awhile i wa in the hospital a few day and told i couldnt drive for  month because i had now suffered a seizure i filed a new comp claim and my psychologist took me off work my ptsd is worse than it wa in the beginning i wa taken off my medication because of the seizure this ha been hell and caused me to not want to live from the depression going back to the office would put me in the hospital no question ive been hospitalized with psychosis from lack of sleep beforeworkmans comp will not cover lost wage for disability or the hospitalization or ambulance etc they even sent me to a shill doctor to say i didnt have ptsd and i wa looking for monetary gain he also said i shouldnt receive treatment because it just reinforced my claim he didnt know that ive received nothing he even made it sound like the person only attempted to sa me he didnt know about all the news coverage i have article they were charged with kidnapping and s assault how do you see doctor and take  med for ptsd and not have it i have even paid for treatment through my own insurance and my psychologist ha waived my copayment for the last  year all my doctor report and note have been given to themthey make it nearly impossible for doctor to get reimbursement im sure he got paid very well though it wa bad he ha an extensive amount of info on him in which he done this to others and even a mom who son died in a car accident that hurt he also belittled me and told me ptsd doesnt cause seizure i nearly ended up in the hospital but my psychiatrist set up a safety plan to protect my sleep for a month the night terror got so bad i fell out of bed twice punched my husband in the face woke up gasping in panic i had to significantly increase my sleep med i have been in the worst spot in my life i have bill in collection from hospital and so on it ha ruined my life and the department of labor is doing the most to make it hell this christmas ha been hard not just financially i havent lost my home and stuff my husband is supportive my family wa traumatized a well and the event last christmas have come up they are very scared for my mental state this all ha caused me to not want to be alive i feel like a burden and useless i cant even afford a nice christmas it heartbreaking ive hired a lawyer which is more financial strain but comp ha used every angle they can to crush me im going to file for federal disability so i can at least stop being subject to the hell they have inflicted my doctor and lawyer want me to never go back there at this pointso this week ha been

555,trigger warning i will be talking about ed anxiety and multiple health condition my family faced i want to start by clarifying this is a ventingthinking post i will be discussing this with my psychiatrist during our next session to hear her professional opinion but in the meantime i wanted to typei am here because i have an eating disorder called arfid and these past few week it ha flared up i think december is a stressful month even more so for people with mental illness there is this sense of rush and pressure i detest and i feel relief in new year even if i know nothing truly ha changed i got arfid in  which is avoidantrestrictive food intake disorder it happened from one day to the other with no explanation one day i wa able to eat the next i wa not i went to a myriad of doctor but everything came back fine i didnt know at the time i had arfid i wa diagnosed around  month ago but i wish i had because it would have helped start treating it sooner i lost so much weight in such a short span of time i had to get new clothes because everything i owned wa too big during this time i have had some better period  but overall arfid ha been very rough to handle you need food to do anything and if you have no energy source or calorie it hard to function i dont wanna derail too much but i am here because i wa watching a video of someone who got arfid after being diagnosed with ptsd everything she said resonated so much i have started wondering if all this time i have been unknowingly living with ptsd since mental illness are hard to differentiate sometimes i think it very possible i want to talk about what the event were even though i realized that it brings me anxiety and i have a sense of having forgotten that time period i associate that with the possibility of ptsd in  i had a lot of thing happen to me at once i had just quit my job and wa gonna go back to study  look for a part time but covid hit right before that i had been living with my grandma for  yearsin the span of twothree week my life wa basically flipped upside down my grandma had a stroke a i wa away on vacation and while she is physically okay she wa never the same after the stroke i do have this memory imprinted of me saying goodbye to her before going to my one week vacation she wa completely independent  would go to the market every day walk excercise watch her period drama she loved cook when i came back one week later she no longer knew who i wa even typing this is hard and i remember the punch in the gut that wa at the time i remember greeting her and then just going to the balcony kind of in a zombie state knowing thing would never be the same again my grandma is alive on body and i love her but that day i lost my grandma i have made some peace with that and i visit her often a her dementia get worse sometimes she remembers my name or make a joke that wa very typical of her humor most of the time she sleepsduring the week i wa away on vacation and before my grandma stroke i also received the news that my stepfather had stage iii melanoma i remember travelling for  hour by bus to meet my family and instantly seeing my mom face i remember and this also make me cry immediately a i write it that she told me a we were walking down a supermarket aisle not the nicest setting no the following day are a blur but i also remember doing what you never should with cancer and going on google and finding this account of a man on reddit who had been diagnosed with melanoma i think something inside of me broke that day too what i remember feeling is a if i were transposing my stepdad into this unknown man his last post had been a month before explaining how his cancer had gotten worse that wa his last post finding that wa traumatic all of it wa traumaticfollowing this and coming back to my grandma right afterwards is when covid hit i had travelled to my mom place just to visit with my backpack and a few belonging and suddenly all travel wa banned i remember being too calm i think that wa my brain defense mechanism because it wa too much all at once it would have been a better sign if i had been upset about not being able to have any of my belonging for almost a month what i did instead unconsciously wa try to make myself smaller i also unconsciously immediately went into help mode  a an example the first thing that i thought after i learned of my stepdads cancer wa how i needed to learn how to drive so i could be helpfulsorry for such a long post but boy wa  a year i wish i could say it stopped there but nope my stepdad had his pet scan and i will just say cancer is a nightmare that never end you just learn to accept it there waiting for the result is something i am unable to type being a bit more concise he had no organ affected but yes some lymph node so he needed to get surgery said surgery had to take place in another city because of the small town we live in and the hospital so i rented an airbnb for him and my mom to stay at post surgery for two month and i wa by myself taking care of the house and my petsi think this wa another thing that really really affected me and when i read about ptsd symptom i nod my head i remember being calm on the surface and a a lie to myself but extremely irritable anything my dog would do would get me upset anything that happened in the house would make me irrationally extremely angry or frustrated i am nothing like that  the polar opposite on hindsight maybe i should have realized something wa going on with me but i wa on survival mode some of the thing i remember thinking were that i couldnt get emotional or break down because i had to be strong for my family i only cried the day of my stepdads surgery which thankfully went well he is now just dealing with some issue but cancer so far ha not returned i also remember this poignant thought a i wa eating if i choke who is going to feed my pet i cant die thats another phrase that trigger something inside and i start feeling like im unraveling a very difficult tangled cord my birthday wa also during those two month honestly i dont remember much of it other than again being very angry because i ordered a cake but i couldnt eat it a my first arfid symptom started showing in small way the day of my birthday my father who is a very long story of it own i dont even want to think about called me late at night he lived in another country i say lived a i went no contact after this he called me and he wished me a happy birthday i had been moody all day and he didnt know everything that i had been going through because we barely had any contact he touched a nerve telling me during our phone call that i had not wished him a happy father day and going on a condescending speech of how i probably had spent it with my stepfather only thing i will say about my bio dad apart that he is a piece of trash is that he always hated my stepdad i dont regret the way i reacted honestly but it wa quite brutal i just snapped and i told him that if he ever wanted to be a part of my life he would never talk to me like that again i blocked him and he ha been blocked ever sinceso the cherry on top of all of these wonderful month seriously i did consider having been cursed or something lol wa that i cut all tie with my dad to be fair it had been something i had contemplated for a while  but to have it happen on my birthday and under those circumstance yeah not a very happy story is itother stuff happened afterwards but i wanna stop there because thats where i feel there is simply no way i didnt get ptsd from this lo and behold the moment my stepdad wa recovered from his surgery and they came back home is exactly when my arfid kicked in i dont blame myself for not connecting all the dot before because i truly wa just trying my best to survive but thinking about it it make absolute sense to conclude the fact i havent been able to improve my eating and the video i mentioned is what brought me here i am of course trying to tackle the eating problem but i think that i have ptsd and i just simply never put a name to it that a lot of my health issue that happened right after were a result of ptsd i had nightmare for a long time but thankfully those went away all i want now is to get better mentally i am much better i went through other very heavy stuff in  like i said but i feel i came out stronger  but that time i had my therapist and my psychiatrist i am fairly sure i have ptsd and that is the root issue of my eating disorder i say this because if i want to find a way to overcome it confirming with my psych that i have ptsd would be a small relief one of the worst thing about this eating disorder is not even knowing how to treat it because it appeared seemingly out of thin air when i backtrack and read about ptsd and how you can forget or have foggy memory of the traumatic event i do i feel thats where i need to start slowly of course but i feel i never truly acknowledged everything that happened to my family but also to me i never mourned it properly nor gave myself space to express my emotion i feel tired but a lot more relieved right now thank you if you have read this mess honestly i am despite how bad it might seem doing quite well mentally trying to stay positive and to keep trying keep fighting i am working on a lot of project that make me happy when i have the energy to this venting felt fantastic i might come back and update you once ive talked to my psych about ptsd but in the meantime thank you for the space and i wish you a nonstressful happy holiday,anxiety

571,ampxbi have survivor guilt i know i did nothing wrong there are so many reason a survivor may blame themselves but the guilt is misplaced the perpetrator should carry the guilt but sadly most perpetrator either dont care or they see nothing wrong with their action i will never receive an apology and some people never changed which make it harder to forgive them since it wa like it wa hard for them to be decent nonabusive human being especially in front of you i did what i could to survive in school but feel like it wa never enough my repressed emotion made people laugh at me until i wa so dead that i could tell people off and finally say no but at what cost emotion are meant to be felt and being in half dead coma where i cant experience any joy and can only feel pain even when i dont feel emotion isnt ideal ive always blamed my self for thing outside of my control yet some people never think how their behavior affect others or feel empathy not all bully are narc but some are weird narc it is especially bad when you isolate your self and dont have support system howeer even when i wa around others it wa fun it wa like unless someone of theirs told them to stop they just acted by insticsscript and attacked me either cause someone told them or they disliked meseen me a weird and that is enough crime to terroize someone and make fun of their emotion even if they have emotional dysregulation i know it may sound naive but to the end i wanted to try to make friend with them but eventually stopped believing in kidness and and male gender a a whole now i feel uncomfortable around guy and really struggle with that it like they are not human with emotion but some weird irrational monster that only hit and scream and act like child i know not all guy are like that only logically emotionally i still ruminate every single day of what i could have done but feel like hitting any of them wouldnt have helped me but also ruminate over the fact that none of them got punished which is what i need for closure i think i feel like i failed because i didnt change their behavior or got them punished somehow which is what every bullying victim should do i wa filled with so much rage and sadness and hatred and anxiety that i puked each time some people were around me and went home cry cause one girl smiledi wasnt allowed to smile or express emotion very little thing lik someone throwing paper at my head affected me tremendlously a if someone kicked me in the stomach when it didnt even hurt physically however it still felt humiliating because they never changed their behavior some people on reddit are in their s and still cant get over bullying and i only talk about it it ruin my life i want to achieve goal i am at way better place now more social and not abused but what happened to me haunt me because bullying is well  when something is wrong with you however sometiems wrong is thing like race and thing you cant change and for me it wa social anxiety and trouble making friend i dont know how to have control and influence and had nothing in common with my peer which made it hard to talk and when i tried to talk i wa usually outwitted but i wa so mute at some point that i just responded back because being mute made me choke for oxygen not talking verbally creates some soet of insanity for me where i act really really weird it like hyper anxiety and it bad i usually overspill word at my therapist and my mum since i havent spoken to people much and socializing is hard i feel like unless i pay for club for interest i cant make friend which bother me ive been rejected and abandoned all of my life which make me self isolate and hate my self i am not at fault for my bullying but the bully have forgotten and will never care how they affected me  this affect me tremendously a a person with a lot of empathy who care about others their reaction are the reaction of mentally ill psychopathic people since normal people care at least a tiny bit now i cant express emotion due to being laughed at for just existing and doing anything which is why i sometimes lash out i am tired of trying and trying and no one caring about me i dont understand why i wa bullied and had little to no friend outside of schooli tried my best to be curuous about others interest but struggled a lot now at uni i am great but am worried it only cause bully dont really lurk here and it is more academically driven and not cause of the hard work i pulled on my self life lost meaning at some point and i got really depressive so the only thing keeping me alive after coming home cry on the bus cause no one wanted to drive me everyone else had transportation wa exercise and journaling but i do have a lot of issue i have to resolve psychologically normal people stop whne you tell them to stop and express emotion  when it come to bulleis they never do and i have this deep shame of not punching someone but the reality is that judging by how horrible these people were even if i lost i would have ended up in a hospital since these guy were nut and  time bigger than me a a girl but i cant help but fantasize of what if i dont know why i wa put in my place and used a a punching bag and scapegoat because i feel like unless you were mean you didnt desserve respect and there were some girl who were nice but they were immature and sissy and horrible and just le mean than the bully girlssomehow guy liked and respected them but didnt respect me and i felt like a total princess waiting to be saved which messed wiht my mind cause i wanted to be the cool masculine chick all of my life and not being able to stand up or defend my self always bugged me i should speak up when something bother me but it bother me how everyone else could express their emotion but even one small smile got me  what are you smiling at  a if i wasnt allowed to smile or laugh ever and they said in the most screaming and nasty way to intimdate me and unfortunatly it work any intimdation tactic work when you cant say no or someone hovers above you it just everything is so overwhelming and i am tired of how everyone see something weak in me to abuse and exploit when i cant even control it it like people somehow know i am weak and i dont know what behavior do i do to give that impression i had to learn a lot about body language because i received some weird abuse on bus during high school too got told i am ugly and some child imitated me when i wa sick and laughed at me cause i wa holding my stomach most of the abuse doesnt make logical sense but not reacting is not enough i feel most in control when i respond but usually people outwit me and make me humiliated so others laugh at me but when i speak fact they are always ready to beat me up and it wa enough to threaten me to make me go away cause i hate fight and physical touch some of the guy that bullied me wanted to make others fear them and that is mentaly insane and childish and i still wonder how they had so many friend and influence while i didnt know almost anyone from the other class,anxiety

581,i am not officially diagnosed with ptsd but with depression and my psychologist say that it pretty likely that i have ptsd so i thought of getting a diagnosis but still  i feel like my experience dont qualify for ptsd my dad wa in prison i only saw him up to  time in my life and the last time i saw him wa when i wa  i think my mom got adopted when she wa a baby so i basically dont know anyone from my biological family except for my mother ive met my father and my biological grandmother like  time but thats about it so it doesnt really feel like i know them i dont really feel close to my adoptive family because they just seem so emotionally unavailable im close to my mom though but at the same time i am not she can be very aggressive  start to throw thing around break door and plate amp more she yell at me and blame me for her hardship in  i wa facing severe depression and all she said wa she doesnt want to live with a sick kid she can be nice and caring too but thats very rare and only last for some hour so she is very confusing and i constantly feel like walking on eggshell with her i get triggered so easily now with noise and people raising their voice or plate falling to the ground etci think i can definitely say that my mom is emotionally abusive because she invalidates my feeling a lot and basically made me feel unseen most of my life there are so many other thing tapping into that  like a in what happened in my childhood but also in the last year ive been hospitalized  time because of depression and i struggled with mental health mainly adhd depression and anxiety for over  year now im  year ago one of my best friend died because of medical issuesthen in  i suddenly started developing panic attack which i luckily dont experience that often anymore but it lead me to having intrusive thought and ultimately developing ocd which still haunt me to this very day in  i fell in love with this guy who struggled with addiction and suicidal tendency he wa very invalidating of my emotion very unavailable and would sometimes even insult me and i think he also kinda sexually assaulted me he would get annoyed during sex if we didnt do what he wanted he would just do something without me really saying yes sometimes he would ask but sometimes he wouldnt and i know if i said no he wouldve stopped but i wa scared of upsetting him he also said it feel like im fucking a dead body and stuff like that so needle to say he wasnt very affectionate when we broke up i kinda fell in this hole of severe depression my ex tried to kill himself in march  and it wa really hard for me to set boundary with him because no matter how much he hurt me he wa struggling too so i empathized but not just that it felt like everything that ever happened in my life came back  fold and hurt so much more i had suicidal thought i weighted wayyyy too little i didnt go out of my room for like  month  only when my mom forced me to go to a psychiatrist i moved out of my mom place beginning this year and ever since then i feel so much better but still now that i got some more stability in my life i feel like sooo much is coming to the surface and starting to really trigger me which lead me to think i have ptsd but i still feel like it not enough to be ptsd because my mom never really beat me for example or stuff like thati know i wrote a lot but i tend to over explain bc i feel like i need to get my point across i live with some people who also struggle with mental health and theyve been through a lot i just sometimes feel like im overreacting and shouldnt feel so pressed bc it couldve been worse,anxiety

590,im so overwhelmed i got diagnosed with ptsd in april of this year my psychiatrist explained that the reason why previous doctor thought i had bipolar disorder or bpd is because of how my brain regulates my emotion stuff from my childhood and post highschool are event that caused my ptsd my psychiatrist explained that when trauma happens early in life your brain will stop and freeze in important emotional development so when my childhood shit happened no wonder i feel such big emotion my brain only know how to regulate it a if im  year old when i got diagnosed my mom wasnt surprised which made me think she understood i wa wrong she doesnt understand how i cant let thing go or grieve in an healthy  amount of time she think i analyze too much which i understand to an extent but also analyzing and finding a cause and effect to why thing happen is how i rationalize it all it give me control and occupies my brain instead of truly feeling thing okay so maybe it not the healthiest way i just wish she understood more i wish my emotion werent so childlike,anxiety

593,ever since early childhood ive been unable to express being uncomfortable the earliest memory i have with my trauma wa in first grade my uncle used to tickle me until i said youre my favorite uncle or just unclethe thing is i couldnt talk when he did it so i couldnt get him to stop my parent would be there too and they would do nothing it would hurt and stress me out he died a few year back and im not even sad i would probably have more trauma if he were still here today the next memory i have is with my grandfather boyfriend my grandpa is  and his boyfriend is  he younger than my mom his young age and my young age made him way stronger than me i wa about fourth grade when i wa messing around with him until it went too far he had grabbed my arm and held me off of the ground and tickled me and didnt stop once i got away i ran and cried in my room the summer of th grade wa the beginning of my ptsd i wa playing with my mother in the pool and i wa held underwater and tickled it had yet again gone too far i had ran inside and cried my mother ha memory issue so she slightly did it to me throughout th grade and in christmas i told my grandfather boyfriend to never tickle me because it made me uncomfortable and he threatened me he wa drunk and didnt know better but i still want to sucker punch him now that im older i had started self harming because i couldnt take the pain i wa in i had many thought of suicide i wa just a kid i would have nightmare of it and it felt so real i still have nightmare to this day eventually i got sent to an outpatient mental institution because i started hearing voice in my head they said it wa a safe place but i wa never safe anywhere i went one of the patient there had ptsd a well when i would hug them or have my arm uncovered they would tickle me i asked them twice not to do it and they didnt listen i told one of the therapist and they did nothing about it after a while i realized that i had to stand up for myself i didnt take shit from anyone anymore i feel like tickling need to stop before anyone else ha to experience the thing that i have no one would listen to me until i committed a rd degree felony im tired im in constant pain every day i can still feel it i dont trust anyone not even my own parent i couldnt hug my mom or even say the word tickle for the longest time tickling used to be a torture method and yet people do it to young kid and even baby im done with this,anxiety

595,so im a relatively recent survivor of a mass shooting hooray america it been a little le than  month since it happened some day are good some day not so much the other night my family and i went to a holiday light event that included unbeknownst to u when buying ticket firework that needed up being really triggering for me causing a kid panic attack and leading me to bust out headphone i happen to keep on me in order to drown out the boom and while i felt mostly fine yesterday im realizing today im still feeling really anxiousdepressed a a result of that episode doe this happen to anyone elsefull disclosure been dealing with some personal stuff not directly linked to the shooting or my trauma from it so it possible thats also weighing on me,anxiety
596,this is going to be part rant part asking for supportif anyone else ha dealt with this and part asking for advicewithout getting into detail i experienced severe medical trauma a a child and wa later diagnosed with ptsd i recently had a resurgence of that trauma after another experience in the spring being in any medical situation is extremely triggering and sends me into a panic so severe that sedative do nothing my dad is attempting to push me into area i am not comfortable with ex getting blood drawn when my trauma revolves around needle and seems to refuse to acknowledge all the progress i made before my setback i wa at a point where i could walk into a doctor office without sedative i would reluctantly allow them to check my vitals i wa even able to get my covid shot i wa working up to getting a blood draw then the other experience happened and it set me back further than anything ever hasit seems like nothing short of a blood test and full physical is enough for him i am an adult so it not like he can force me into it but i wholeheartedly believe that if he could he would i recognize that both physicals and blood test are essential part of staying physically healthy and i want to reach a point where i can do those thing but mental health matter too and i cannot risk putting myself in any more questionable situation while the wound are still rather fresh i also have severe health anxiety and he seems to think that telling me that i might have something wrong with me that could harm me down the line is helpful he is hellbent on pushing me to do thing faster than i am ready to and refuse to listen when i tell him that that doe the exact opposite of what he hope it will do he doe not understand trigger and say that me asking him to use modified language and approach sensitive subject in a way that i have told him cause le distress is beating around the bush and ignoring the elephant in the room biting off more than i could chew is what caused the trauma resurgence in the first place and ive blamed myself for that ever since what do i have to do to get it across to him that everyone heals at their own pace and rushing that healing can be and in my case already ha been detrimental every doctor ive had ha told me that they would love to see me get to that point but they want me to do it on my own term when i am ready so it can be a positive experience im just so frustrated and defeated,anxiety
597,the last  week or so have been pure hell a new very stressful job working crazy hr which mean no regular meal schedule and i get so busy i forget to drink water throw in some insomnia and im so exhausted that my anxiety is at an all time high ive had several panic attack inducing episode from very small trigger and that hasnt happened to me in year i havent gone a night without terrifying nightmare ive lost all interest in everything right now and i dread christmas however im a huge people pleaser so i walk around with a smile and tell everyone im fine because i dont want to ruffle any feather or bring anyone down im in that place where i feel like ill never be truly happy again can we just fast forward a couple week ,anxiety

620,tw child abuse sorry for the novel but i want to make sure everyone understands im not great at getting my thought across in writing without going into too much unnecessary detail i f wa severely physically sexually and mentally abused by my father for the first  year of my life i wa diagnosed with ptsd technically cptsd and i wa in very intense therapy for  year after with one of the top psychiatrist in new york and then for another  year with a regular therapist so for the most part im okay i of course have thing that are harder for me thing can trigger me sometimes i have trouble figuring out if something is an actual threat or just my ptsd getting the best of me i wa hoping to get some help figuring this out when i wa  i started dating the most amazing man i have ever met i love him for a bunch of reason but ill stick to the one relevant this this sub he is so kind and gentle and patient he never get angry or raise his voice he never speaks harshly to me never try to control me he is what my soul needed weve been dating  and a half year now and our wedding is set for april   day eeek but now there is a serious problem and im scared itll be the end of an amazing relationship for this post well simply call my fianc m m dad wa abusive towards his wife m mom they tried to hide it but i know the sign for year i had a gut feeling then one day about  year into our relationship m dad slipped and did it in front of me a far a i know he never got physical just verbally tore her apart i dont want to get into too much graphic detail but he made her feel worthless literally like she didnt matter so much so that one day she fell and broke her ankle but refused medical treatment she spent two week sitting in a chair and never moving not to eat or even use the bathroom m dad told her she wasnt worth itdidnt deserve helped and she agreed with him i finally convinced her to go to the hospital but it wa too late she developed a blood clot from not moving and passed away i  blame him for her death i remember the day she fell and how triggering it wa for me to see a man treat his wife that way again i dont want to go into detail but it wa brutal i still cry about it ive had many conversation over the year with m about it i asked him how he could stand to be around his father ive asked him why he doesnt cut him off i ask these thing in curious  way im not trying to make him feel bad or demand he doe i just want to understand him m doesnt get upset that i ask basically he believed his mom would want him to have a relationship with his dad we agree to disagree because it his father so he get to call the shot with their relationship it wa never too big of a deal i easily avoided being alone with him i would leave the room if he started bashing m mom which he still doe often despite her being dead  year m would come visit me at my house and eventually moved in here we didnt visit m dad often and when we did it wa for a short amount of time so i dont think i realized how much of a trigger he wa unless i wa talking about m mom passing to be clear m dad wa always extremely nice to me but i cant get what he did to m mom out of my head i know abuser are usually nice to outsider he isnt abusive towards his kid but is a very selfish person and that often cause issue that upset them one day m brother  m well call him a approached u and said that their dad wanted to be free of him and their dog  m dad had purchased a  welsh springer spaniel without doing any research because he wanted something to show off theyre a high energy and high maintenance  breed he ha no desire to take care of him and he said he wa annoying with having to share his home with a anymore because m dad wanted to be able to bring hookup over without them feeling weird yuck but true a asked if wed be willing to get a place with him m dad said hed pay cash for a  bedroom  bathroom coop on the condition me and m let a and dog live there for a little while i dont know why i didnt take my ptsd into account and im kicking myself for not i feel so stupid where i live now and have my whole life is actually owned by my grandpa mom dad it a two family house and me mom and sister share the downstairs while grandpa and grandma have upstairs they never stepped foot into the downstairs without asking first and they never really asked unless some sort of work had to be done they always respected our space i stupidly assumed it would be the same with m dad offer especially since he wa buying it for u while grandpa just let u live here because of issue from mom divorce grandpa didnt buy a  family house specifically for mom m dad bought the coop specifically for u ya knowwell now m dad who ha a key ha decided he can come and go a he plea without any notification or warning despite moving all my stuff there ive been back at mom place to say i am triggered is an understatement thing like showering changing sleeping etc are still really vulnerable moment in my dad for me i need fianc to sit with me while i shower or ill have a panic attack before him my mom sat with me the shower is where my dad molested me so the sound is triggering im scared to death hell walk in on me i think my heart would just give out i also have generalized anxiety disorder adhd and now my doctor want me to get evaluated for autism so like mentally i definitely need my home to be my safe space for more reason than just ptsd im also  worried because in our culture once were married i wont be an outsider anymore im worried hell start abusing metreating me like he doe his kid this should be an easy enough fix m should tell his dad not to come over unless we invite him tell his dad to please respect our space if m dad pull the i paid for it card than we say thanks but no thanks and move but remember how i said m is this softie who never so much a raise his voice yeah thats great for my soul but a terrible quality to have because he never defends himself or me so he wont set the boundary he wont stick up for me i feel very alone and vulnerable because of this which make it much harder to cope with and im not asking him to be aggressive about this just a hey dad can you just please not pop in whenever you feel like it please call me first so i can make sure it okay with my wife is fine  i dont necessarily blame m for being this way i think he scared of his father he wont straight up admit it but i know him and i know he scared of him i have choice i can break up with m call of the wedding stay home safe but i lose the best thing to ever happen to me i can refuse to move to the new place and m can decide if we get our own place alone or if he want to leave me hed probably not chose me because of his fear of his dad but maybe he figure out a way to make everyone happy and we stay together i can move into the new place and hope for the best if it end up being bad i can try to convince m to move but what if he refuse to im struggling to make a decision because i dont know if i should be worried because  logically this is a bad situation or if this is just ptsd brain making me overthinkworry for no reason i just dont want to be terrified all the time especially in my own home  right now im leaning towards refuse to move and leave the ball in m court i do think id be willing to move to the new place if m could be more consistent with supporting me ive told him that but he just tell me relax itll be fine i dont have to explain to you guy why thats the wrong thing to say,anxiety

665,i wa drugged and raped a a teenagermy coparent ha multiple partner one of his partner falsely claimed he raped her out of angerspite so id take his child from him and not want any contact with him she also threatened to call the cop on himive spent a year trying to process this to no avail since then he prioritized this partner who he met after me and our child conception over our child they both have said it cause my inability to forgive and be ok with her relationship with him and being around our child by extension i specifically said i didnt want him to be with this woman before they started dating cause i knew she wa a self serving malicious woman he hid their relationship too this situation ha led me to have no trust in his judgement or respect for him i know this also ha caused a limitation in his mind for the level of love and involvement he ha with our child the same way a there is a limitationblockage for the level i want myself or our mutual child to be in his lifefamily i feel like ive been in constant fight or flight because of him keeping this woman in his life that my child is not safe and im not safe and there is a boundary on how far him and his family can be a part of our livesim usually very good with psychology to the point my therapist cant even give more input outside of my own self work this one i cant fix on my own thoughits like when i try to dive into it and break it down both with rationalitylogicfacts v emotion  i cant it like i get a good start on it then i run head first into a wall and instead of crashing and burning i instead start bouncing off all surrounding object issue around these peoplesituation which then sends me into a bpd split cause all i see is the insidious selfishness that ha occured from them bothi cant wrap my mind around if im actually wrong for how strongly my negative feeling for this partner of his are or if im correct in my feelingsi also cant figure out how to get past this further more i feel i shouldnt have to suck it up and get over it a they both have said to me while she is still in a relationship with himi realize the healing needed behind this is for myself and our child and not his benefit however i also dont feel i should be tolerantaccepting to this woman especially if he also cant see the rationality on how damaging their relationship ha been and be respectful enough to forgive her but let her go for the benefit of others mental and physical safety even deeper i dont know if i can fully heal with her with him because it scream danger in my eye to my childim taking him to court for custody im having it in the court order she cant be at his housearound my kid while shes in his custody he said hed rather loose our child from his life than their relationship ive said if thats the only way to have peace and heal so be it i guess what i came here to ask is am i irrational for my feeling on this and how do i heal to get past the metaphorical wall that ha been created in my brain,anxiety
666,my fiance and i have had some very intense year for the past  year with a car fire miscarriage fighting with previous landlord and losing a lot of money pandemic corona baby two psychotic episode one involving the police because he went missing all while i a well struggle to get help for my anxiety from doctor who doesnt get it we both got diagnosed with autism which mean getting help creates their own set of problem either it hard to communicate it to doctor who doesnt know how to take the diagnosis into account or it creates a dispute about what institution ha responsibility for treatment of autism completely neglecting the fact that autists also need psychiatric help like any other personit mean that every time we tried to reach a safe point something unpredictable and crazy happens just trying to get help ha been part of this insane progress it constantly tempting just to give up im still in the progress of getting help from the anxiety that im now pretty sure is ptsd besides the cptsd i originally tried to get help for after getting the autism diagnose and realising what shit ive been through just the thought of going to see a new doctor make me tremble a well a writing this obviously but my fiance started showing the same sign it started after getting increased in medicine for high blood pressure but it not a know side effect my theory is that it could be a reaction triggered by bad news he wasnt prepared for even if it relatively harmless and unrelated it indicates that thing arent going in the right direction tampering with the medicine didnt do much differenceif i got ptsd from this why shouldnt he but after all the struggle ive been through just to get more than medical help due to being autistic im afraid it would only prolong the problem if i told him his anxiety could be due to ptsd but of course i could also be projecting my own experience onto it expect im far from the only autist stuck in the system this way we just want a normal and stable life back if only seeking help would actually do that rather than making it worse,anxiety

724,i have ptsd but i never had physical abusive relationship i had emotional abusive relationship but i dont think thats what caused me to have ptsd i wa watching an episode about intrusive thought from therapy in a nutshell on youtube it say usually your trauma is related to what you value for example a doctor would concern about their physical health a lot i just feel i cant accept any love thats gonna break i feel like love can overcome anything to me i either love someone or not love someone and this caused a lot of pain for me for example i just broke up with my bf he say he love me but not that much for him to overcome the difficulty he still want other girl he is moving his family dont want an asian now i have the image coming into my mind and an instant feeling of scaredi guess cuz i feel whatever seems true is fakei had good faith in human until i got bullied at  after i broke up with my bf at that time i didnt blame the bully cuz i think thats how human are cuz people do good and bad thing all the time but i just started to feel the world is so cold and i had chronic depression since then but anyways i decided to just fuck around in this world i didnt want to trust anyone however i met two guy one at  and one recently both of them really wanted to date me i wa hesitating at first but they seemed genuine so i let them in i only got a result of getting my value of love hurt and traumatized no matter how much they seem like they care or love they gonna leave me for something else they want i could trust them but the trust can be overthrown in one night i tried to accept and change my value but im so stubborni just feel so painful with all those intrusive image and thought and fear i try to convince myself these are ok thing happen but i just feel my value in love is so strong and i cant live with it anymore cuz the chance i can be not hurt in this world is very low if it normal amount of pain i would take but it too much for me maybe after month of pain i could live single and not letting anyone in again but i know i would never be actually happy living in a world against my value cuz even im living single seeing all those evil thing done by people still hurt my value,anxiety

727,it a bit of a dumb and wild story but hang in there tw mention of rpe uncensoredso it my birthday today it now like pm so the day is ending and i woke up this morning very exhausted i went to work decided to put not  but  espresso shot into my starbucks frappe the first half of the day wa generally fine then while doing my work i stumbled on one of the case i wa clearing that mentioned that the person whose data i wa looking at wa arrested for sexual exploitation so i googled what sexual exploitation wa because i wa wondering what it encapsulated like if it included rape i ended up being thrown question suggestion and answer about what are  type of sexual assault and what not and ended up on iirc an australian legal company website talking about aggravated sexual assault and what needed to be involved for a rape to be considered an aggravated sexual assault then i got curious although my police case against my rapist ha already been closed with no further action because the public prosecutor decided not to take it to trial i had always wanted to know how severe my assault would be considered in the eye of my local law like whether the type of violence i experienced while it happened would be considered an aggravated assault i ended up going to the local law website to read about the band of punishment for sexual assault based on aggravating factor and the presence of those or lack thereof unable to get an answer i turned to my local subreddit to get some answer from fellow resident who were legal aide lawyer law student or those who know the law much more intricately than me a mere post on that subreddit at pm today led to  subsequent hour of revisiting my trauma in very detailed way talking about my police case and how it wa very horribly handled with breach of police procedure which caused a lot of retraumatisation and i dare say ha impacted me nearly a much a the assault did back and forth with many people saying that i probably did not have enough evidence to pursue the case in criminal court i repeatedly mentioned and also agreed that that wa true but that it wa not my question at this time also some talk about possibly appealing the verdict of dropping the case or possibly taking it to civil court or filing a complaint at a smaller court under le severe but still imprisonable charge very much appreciated all of the conversation i had with very kind and helpful people but in having these conversation i accidentally sent myself into a triggered state brain wa all occupied with replying these people so i didnt realise mentally that i wa beginning to get triggered but by around pm i wa feeling outside of my body incredibly restless unable to breathe heart palpitation and jitteriness i just felt really weird im not usually an anxious person so i attributed it the espresso thought i just took one shot too many usually it wear away after some time but in this case today it kept up and is still keeping up now even though im really mentally tired so yeah i feel like a complete idiot for having accidentally triggered myself on my birthday last year birthday wa not a good one either these are the two that ive had since the rape i had gotten a call from that horrid police officer supervisor and supervisor tried to excuse his officer vile behaviour and convince me that i wa overthinking it then when i said i wanted explanation for the officer action that led to me footing  in one medical bill for an er visit to get medical help for my rape injury on my own dime he said oh but they already refunded you in full right all settled already right and kept repeating over and over that the why no longer mattered since it wa resolved by the hospital then he kept cutting me off every time i tried to speak started getting short with me and when i wanted to voice out verbally all the thing they agreed to look into because the call wa recorded so they would not be able to deny that they promised me to investigate he spoke over me cut me off and tried to say ok thank you bye and hang up lol i cried quite badly after that and barely wa mentally present during a family dinneranyway yeah im dumb a fuck and i seem to selfsabotage so much without realising i hope this physical feeling of activation will be gone after i sleep tonight thanks for reading if youve made it all the way to the end haha i appreciate you,anxiety

750,im sorry i started writing and i couldnt stop i wa abused a a child first violently yoyo followed by a month reprieve while the sickos swapped out then sexually abused for  and a half year the violence wa real bad my mother and brother  year older copped that too worse than me we all had each other to lean on with that but the sexual stuff wa a secret a it wa vile and sadistic low selfesteem started with the violence i couldnt save my mother or my brother i remember wishing that i wa bigger or stronger or not scared i felt frustrated that i wasnt it continued with being brainwashed that the sa wa all my fault it wa exacerbated by knowing that my brother wa not being sad i wa told by my abuser that he chose me because he knew that i wanted it to happen guilt lower selfesteem shame blame thats where they ball gotta holdi suffered an apparently rare form of abuse where my attacker both wa sadistic and rewarding i wa subjected to despicable cruelty then rewarded with praise and pleasurable sensation i wa brainwashed into knowing that i couldnt tell anyone through threat of being removed from my home the hatred that my mother would feel toward me the mockery from my brother and the home for dirty little boy that i surely would be sent tomim not telling anybody anything new so i wont detail my coping strategy or how i developed and adapted those strategy and carried them through to adult life  i also wont go into detail about the behavioural problem and my rebellion against authority during my teenage year but i will tell you i didnt tell a soul what had happened to me until after my th birthdayi sabotaged every relationship i had from when i wa  year old until well after my th birthday tremendously inappropriate explosion of uncontrollable anger wa how my ptsd at that time still undiagnosed manifested followed by day or week of shame and guilt finally i got sick of knowing that it wa my fault but not knowing what wa wrong with me so i sought help i wa diagnosed with posttraumatic stress disorder major depression and acute anxietyi began treatment immediately after a few month the treatment seemed to be having some positive result so the treating psychologist suggested that maybe seeking justice would speed up my recovery so i went down that track and made a complaint to the police who were so convinced a to the validity of my statement they arrested and charged the paedophile  at the time of his arrest the police seized object photograph and detailed note including date and detail of the various torture used that the paedophile had kept a souvenir of his attack on me they found similar file on other boy a well  unfortunately the other boy were never located or identified and therefore were unable to give evidence against himover the next  year my treatment wa interrupted regularly by going to court giving evidence being shouted at by lawyer a they called me a liar i wa forced to relive the attack over and over and over again  finally i got my justice a guilty verdict and a year jail sentence for the bastard but sadly it wa not the magic bullet that i had anticipated all that the process had achieved wa to make my illness more deep seated and bought all of the pain to the front again where once i wa coping with life up till when i wa  old albeit not very well since that time my life ha been a downward spiral until nowsince i wa diagnosed nearly  year ago now i have attempted suicide  time once failed because i underestimated the effectiveness of catalytic converter once because my heroin addict friend could see past my lie and didnt want my death on her hand and once because i wa found a couple of hour sooner than optimal and stomach pumping and adrenalin saved the daythose  year have seen me in and out of psychiatric facility  time each time wa for a minimum of  week and  of those time were over the past  month i wa poked prodded hooked up to electo magnetic machine that bombarded me with magnetic pulse i took pill until i rattled when i walked and promoted a kg weight gain i wa given electric shock to my brain and i wa treated in a way where my eye movement wa supposed to stop intrusive thought i wa counselled for hundred of hour and i wa hypnotised  time  once i even paid to have a demon banished from my spirit by a witch i wa baptised in a freezing swimming pool begging a god that i knew wa fictitious to heal me while people crazier than ill ever be on my worst day stood in a semicircle around me chanting garbled nonsense in tongue ill tell you right here and right now i tried everything that wa offered i wanted to get well and i tried damned hard to get well morbid depression clung to me like the scent of a rotting corpse no matter the medicine no matter the psychological treatment method that depression clung to me with icy finger that nothing could pry loose in july this year a solemn faced psychiatrist announced that i had treatment resistant depression but there were more option to try more ect higher dos of drug that had already been tripled their original dos noi gave up so now what th time lucky or somehow find an answer i honestly dont know i know that ive prepared planned and paid for the first option right down to the finest detail now a single call to my solicitor will begin an automated process of erasing all evidence of me and my existence whilst simultaneously converting that evidence into cash which is to be doled out in equal portion to my longsuffering child who despise me i made those plan while hoping above hope that the second option occurs i dont know and im tremendously sad and i have long since alienated myself from anyone who could give me moral support or hope but i still hope for wellnessi feel the second hand of some cosmic clock painfully rapping the top of my head a it count down to a predetermined end i know that my time is almost up i can taste it like metal in my mouth yet i still dont

764,having cptsd is like being stuck in two reality the present because were forced to live here but also the past because were chained to it a prisoner because our mind still life in the past it cant live in the present  therefore we exist physically almost like zombie here but not here we are so sensitized to the past that we become so desensitized to the present  desensitized to the point where we are depersonalized and derealized and each subsequent trigger of the present push u further into the past to repeat this vicious cycle we cant fully enjoy now experience or make new memory or feel to the capacity we should be able to because the gear of our mind are clogged up with unprocessed memory thought and feeling that are taking up space it like we are mentally constipated or we are like a drain thats clogged up there just no room for anything new so instead of new memory getting retained they get rejected like a clogged drain cant handle anymore water so the excess overflow onto the floor this is why it so hard for u to make new memory and why our memory appear to be failing u i think this is also why sensory overload trigger dpdr just too much too much information feeling thought and there no room for it all so the brain naturally begin to reject it and dissociate the healing process is like a laxative or like drano clearing the pipe and gear in our mind a thing get processed and shuffled into their right space and place our mind can receive and retain new experience and memory and this is where our memory would appear to improvei realized all this because a i heal and process thing i wa able to feel more today and feel more present it like my brain could receive and take in my surroundings and my environment i played a song and for the first time in year music hit me it just moved me deeply i began to cry happy tear just feeling thing i havent felt in a long long time and it feel really good,anxiety

786,i will not be going into detail but basically something really fucked up and traumatic happened to me yesterday i feel like i dealt with it decently well in the moment and i went on a really long walk and processed it a bit drew some art and i talked about it with some friend and took some step towards raising awareness about this issue so that people would know this kind of shit happens and should not be happening and when i got home i wa able to hydrate and eat a favorite food and vent to my roommatebut today i woke up and i feel so tense and like kind of in shock and im not sure what i can do to care for myself today so that this hopefully doesnt become full blown ptsd ive had ptsd several time before because i have had a lot of traumatic stuff happen in my life but usually i wa actively prevented from doing anything to care for myself in the aftermath and now im wanting to try to see if i can prevent this from like ingraining itself in my nervous system somehow i keep like starting to replay the event in my head but it stop feeling real even regardless of the trauma aspect it wa a pretty weird situation like feel like out of a movie so i think that add to it being hard to process it a a real thing that happenedtheres also likea nonzero chance that this may happen again tbh or i will at least be forced into situationslocations where this outcome is possible again and while i dont anticipate i will ever feel safe again in the location it happened since it literally is not safe it is unavoidable and im wondering if it possible to calm myself enough to be like yeah im not safe but not like panicking about it any tip what help do i just keep up with regular self care or is there more i could trythank you,anxiety

789,disclaimer i am not a lawyer or an expert i havent seen this completely to the end and not sure if it will work i am diagnosed with several mental disability including ptsd with over  year of medical documentation  yall ive spent  of my income on medical expense i have state marketplace insurance with a high deductible subsidized with a tax creditnot getting my extra tax back now i am above the poverty level but basically thought i wa screwed if i didnt have to cover all these long term expense therapy prescription group therapy doctor visit i could literally rent my own apartment a im sure many of you do i am experiencing financial hardship and making tough call about my health due to expense  i did some digging in my state we have medicaid for employee with disability the limit in my state is  annual income compared to regular medicaid being below the poverty threshold there a lot of conflicting info about eligibility even the department of social service doesnt understand it they told me i need disability income ssissdi and that they have never seen anyone with that medicaid plan that didnt already have disability income  the requirement for ssissdi would inherently disqualify almost everyone who should in theory be covered under medicaid for employee with disability ssissdi defines disability a being unable to perform substantial gainful activity ie working so i thought what the heck what is even the point  after calling so many different agency and resource all morning i found medicaidgov which allows you to search federal document regarding medicaid and disability there is a document on there that specifically state the following  there is no requirement that the individual must at one time have been an ssi recipient to be eligible under this provision however if the individual wa not an ssi recipient you must do a disability determination to ensure that the individual would meet the eligibility requirement for ssi a disability determination for an individual who wa not previously an ssi recipient should not consider whether the individual engaged in substantial gainful activity sga since use of sga a an eligibility criterion would in almost all instance result in the individual not being eligible under this group effectively negating the intent of this provision  i attached this document directly to my application and hope i get some good news back hopefully this get me to the medical review team portion of the application   if you have a disabilityptsd is considered by the ada and crap insurance it worth looking into this and what your state offer each state is able to define their own income  asset limit house car and retirement fund do not count toward asset  a side note  i have worked to get ssissdi benefit with young adult the process is tough and they deny everyone at first im not sure if this process is equally a tough but there are plenty of not for profit law organization that will represent disability case for free,anxiety

795,tw uncensored use of rpe  sxual abse i see two therapist a cbt psychologist and a trauma  emdr counsellor at the moment and have been toying with the idea of attending a support group for assault survivor because during both therapy there is just a mountain of thing we are working through that i have not really ever worked on my rape or previous assault even nearly  year later however in my entire country my country is really small it an island  one single citystate there is literally only one running support group for sexual violence  it seems like my entire country isnt big on support group outside of addiction meeting this group say that it for sexual abuse survivorsnow my lived experience ha been mostly several sexual assault done by different people and a violent rape last year that lasted hour i currently have ptsd from the rape mainly in the form of flashback and raperelated nightmare where i cant escape even if i tell someone they dont listen and my rapist steal me back and abuse me all over again over and over i personally cant tell if i have experienced csa  i have several symptom and body reaction that point to it and have faint memory but idk if they are real or not so i prefer not to refer to myself a sexually abused because i dont want to taint the severity of it but i wonder if it would still be okay to attend a sexual abuse support group a someone who at least per what i believe ha only mainly been sexually assaulted multiple time by different people do you think any abuse survivor would be offended if i were to attend would appreciate the advice thank you,anxiety
796, helloi have some question about emdr that are important to me so i would appreciate it if you could help memy first main question is why the fourth phase that is desensitization is not enough why must we go to the phase of changing the core belief after this stage if someone stop in the fourth phase and doe not go to the next phase can he feel calm and relieved because if this step remove the sensitivity completely i think it is obvious to say that the treatment ha been done unless this step basically mean a reduction in sensitivity not a complete elimination of sensitivity that is this stage reduces the sensitivity and this remaining sensitivity is completely destroyed by installing positive belief for example learning a skill to prevent trauma from happeningmy second main question is that i am having a hard time installing core belief if it matter ive always been bullied it started with family and friend a a child and culminated in a very intense and very long trauma during my high school year i have also been bullied by my father i mean bullying in general bullying domination humiliation beating i feel extremely helpless and weak in front of people and if we are logical this feeling is real i never have an experience with which to install positive belief i have no point of light to cling to i feel the most profound sense of helplessness on my part and the darkness of the world and even if i desensitize all of this i know i need an installation but i dont have it this installation must be powerful i have never been able to succeed trying to install through few or poor experience the only thing that can have potential in me is to learn a martial art my whole body and mind is telling me this and it like my mind is begging me to do this but the first problem is that i dont know how true this is and the second problem which is very important is that im incredibly obsessive so my obsession is very focused on the fact that if i learn martial art i will get hurt for example i will go blind in one eye or i will get brain damage i would be grateful if you could help me,anxiety

900,i wa arguably sexually assaulted when i wa intoxicated a few year ago by a trusted person i have been seeing a few licensed professional for a while i didnt report the incident to law enforcement until last year partially because i wa married and i found it unfair to hurt the feeling of my husband and others who love me i tried to handle it alone and i made a lot of flawed decision such a entering into an extramarital relationship with this person to prevent him from further damaging my reputation he took a sex video of me without my consent later and threatened to show it to other people he used it to exploit me financially emotionally and sexually i am hopeless and my confidence is destroyed i graduated from a top  national university with a ba and i am an entrepreneur i wa a ballet dancer i enjoyed working out i enjoyed creating traditional and digital art and traveling to different country well i can no longer seek pleasure in these activity and i am constantly troubled by suicidal thought i got nothing from this abusive relationship and resistance seemed to be futile the guy ha a wife and an extramarital girlfriend and he always told me that he had sex with me only because his extramarital girlfriend had a menstrual period he said that i am worthless and i should kill myself he said i am disposable and cheap like a piece of kleenex after the police started the investigation he also started spreading rumor to my friend neighbor acquaintance and even my client i wa constantly judged by people in the local community they talked behind me and made false accusation about me i have been socially selective but some people who i dont normally interact with seem to verbally attack me even on social medium his extramarital girlfriend keep bringing me down by calling me a jealous psychopath who ha been trying hard to steal this man from her i stay silent but i feel bad because i did everything for survival reasonslaw enforcement is not very helpful a police officer questioned me for making the report late and asked if i did everything to find an excuse to save my marriage the detective did not push the case further in a timely manner and waited for the guy for at least a year to accept her interview prosecutor doesnt seem responsive he said that he would meet with me to discus the finding and i have waited for  month the case is possibly doomed i tried to seek help from victim association no response i asked local lawyer around and they said they would not help a victim but alleged offendersthe guy ha a few local business in the community and i am triggered every time when i am close by i dont feel like avoiding these district simply because he ha business there but i literally froze every time when i wa there any advice will be appreciated i am simply looking for a new perspective,anxiety

903,hii doe anyone else deal with randomish bout of extreme paranoia especially when drinking im scared he going to get me somehow and everything seems like a sign running into certain people who he doesnt even really know and the music and a post he shared that included a nickname that my friendex gf us idk this happens semi regularly amp i tried to go home because i feel so terrified amp but i couldnt shake the feeling he wa in my room so came back out im scared he going to hurt my family even tho i know it irrational i cant stop being afraid  is this common or have i actually lost my mind,anxiety
904,ive recently posted the diagnosis criterion here in an attempt to remind everyone including myself that what we went through wa a threatening or horrible event and that the professional who diagnosed u with ptsd actually determined that our experience wa so severe that it meet the definition in the dsmicdafter posting this there were multiple people claiming that ptsd is not diagnosed based on the severity of the event but instead based on the severity of symptom this is just false and everyone can look up the diagnosis criterion themselves ptsd is diagnosed based on the symptom a well a the event that caused them while people might develop ptsdlike symptom after a le severe event the dsm and icd have a different diagnosis for thisthe diagnosis wa really helpful for me a i finally could explain what wa going on with me i would have felt the same way if i wa diagnosed with something else a long a it is a correct diagnosis this is not about gatekeeping suffering or trauma ptsd is not the only way that people are suffering there are other event just a painful a those that we went through even if they are not included in the criterion it just that ptsd is a reaction to certain specific eventspersonally i do wish for ptsd to be a specific diagnosis and that the word will not lose it meaning the diagnosis for me wa also a huge relief a i now can tell someone whats going on with me and therefore they know more or le what im going through if the term will be used to describe trauma and all other way a trauma can affect mental health the person i tell about my diagnosis will no longer have this accurate specific idea of whats going oni do believe that it id in the interest to get an accurate diagnosis because thats how you one get a better understanding of themselves every diagnosis is valid not just ptsd the amount of suffering someone endures after an event is valid regardless of whether it meet the diagnosis criterion of ptsd or not some people struggle for year until one event finally break them i did not have those struggle before my trauma and id never argue that i suffer more than those who have so much baggage that they have to take with them just because they do not have a ptsddiagnosisthe last thing id like to mention i generally like the nogatekeeping policy and the way everyone here show so much compassion nonetheless i think we should be more careful before we assume validate someone claim who think they have ptsd and share our story with them for one simple reason there are child on reddit while i understand that a lot of people went through hell in their childhood it is not uncommon for teenager to feel like the world is ending due to painful but normal life experience childhood trauma and these painful life experience are two completely different thing every child should receive help whether it is from someone online a friend or a therapist nonetheless it could make them feel hopeless if they start to feel like they have ptsd due to reading stuff online it might also be traumatizing for them if we start to share our story about rape war murder and domestic violence with themfeel free to report me i wa already accused of gatekeeping although i really never had these intention,anxiety

913,dear mod would you consider implementing community flair for those user that already have an official ptsddiagnosis by a licensed professional and those with suspected ptsd and other flair option it recently came up in a discussion and i think this could be a good idea there are people coming to this community to read about experience of people with ptsd people who think they could have ptsd should contact a licensed professional and i do not encourage selfdiagnosing at all a it could be dangerous nonetheless id argue it would be helpful for them to know that the post they are reading are written by people that already have an official diagnosisthose who do not yet have an official diagnosis would not feel pressured to use the term ptsd if theyd like to share their struggle additionally the community could also become more inclusive by allowing for those with ptsdlike symptom but not ptsd itself to be acknowledged,anxiety

937,tw rapesexual assaultampxbampxbhi ive never posted anything on reddit before and i just hope this is the right place to ask about this thing a therapist said to me thats been bothering me a loti went to a new psychotherapist a few week ago to deal with past sexual assault ive been diagnosed with depression and ptsd by a psychiatrist the therapist is a cognitive behavioral psychotherapist who doe emdr therapyin the second appointment i told her about how the metoo movement triggered my trauma back in  it took me several year after this to seek to help and how much metoo ha helped me and how much hearing other people story meant to me etc she made some weird face but i didnt really think anything of itthe next appointment however  she started the session by telling me that she want me to know that even though the metoo movement ha been pretty good overall in some aspect it also gone too far and that i just should think about whether i want to talk about being raped outside of therapy because i could be charged with defamation and that in the future we could explore whether my rape wa rape at all and shes actually not sure if ive really been traumatized i never gave the impression that i wa going to press charge ive only told about what happened to me to one person in my lifei felt really dismissed and started to secondguess myself i canceled my next appointment am i being too sensitive should i give her another chance she also asked me to think about the worst moment of my trauma in the second session i know something about trauma therapy and im not sure that this is how fast it supposed to go am i wrong ive been incredibly anxious after this and havent been able to sleep or focus on work and studying,anxiety

975,trigger warning earlier this morning right a the sun rise i wa in my room letting out loud noise from my mouth because i felt extreme fear and i would get intrusive image if i didnt let out something from me so i made loud hurt noise from my mouth and i wa scared and afraid of terrible scary feeling so i just kept having to do it and my whole body wa stiffened from my trauma because back when i first developed schizophrenia the scariest moment in my life at the hospital i wa straightening out my body flexing it out of fear and seven month after getting out of the hospital evil voice threatened to chop up my body every day all day for seven month and i didnt have good enough mentally to know they werent real so i believed them and flexed my body all day every day for seven month and i wa just burnt out by the end of the seven month so still today when my trauma is out my body is the stiffest hardest body there is because my body is full of trauma and just a little bit ago i let out some of my pain to my dad and he just act like i let out a terribly dark evil weapon just by letting my negativity out to him of all the stuff i went through because i want him to say im sorry and prove that he love me and tell me he love me but he go instead and say you should just do stuff for yourself so you can feel better and if you cant even accept a little of that you cant accept criticism but i always just think maybe i can finally have a shoulder to cry on and it would finally be a good thing but everyone just doesnt like me bringing up my pain since it negative and they dont like me bringing them up a a part of the negativity then they think that im just a thoughtless criticizer who attacking them and then they go and want to stop talking to me or they go away from me and im just left alone they just want to keep leaving me empty handed and lacking until the day come where i go and overwork myself with self help that they want me to only do and pull myself out of my mental illness and they think they are just asking me for me to not be a weirdo and to be more hygienic but they only ask me to do all the work of healing myself by myself ive been alone for like six year and ive had schizophrenia for four year ive become a weirdo and ive become unfunctional because it all too much for me to handle and im just asking for help but they think i just want to criticize them and they start talking in a more stern voice and im heavily hurt i really am i feel robotic and super logical through my cry and opening up myself to my family i keep hoping theyll help me feel human again whenever i bring up my negativity to people they act like all of sudden like im their enemy and they want to sprint away from me but to be nice they stick around long enough to fulfill a conversation with me and they say i have thing to do so i have to go everyone apparently ha to go if i dont see them for a long time and finally end up talking to them they give me conversation that is long enough to be called a conversation and then they say sorry i have to go but hey i love you and they leave me to be lonely again people just want me to be positive and functional but when they dont see that in me ill have to wait a month to talk to them again thing is i want to be normal i want to be someone everyone think is cool but i dont want to have fake painful only costing me conversation for my family sake and then they go and think see sage should act like this more often this is why he should stop bringing up useless negative thing but it just cant work that way im literally prevented from thinking certain thought and have a blank mind involving those spot because my trauma sits in that area of my brain and is full of scary feeling and terrible stuff and i can only access those thought if i yell out or cry out and reexperience those terribly dark thing but im seriously afraid of that stuff plus im so weak and so alone for so long i dont want to be alone if i ever do go through those area again im not asking for too much but my family act like im asking for my own private house and im asking for them to pay for it but i just want them to be there me when im having a critical moment and not be annoyed with me and finally let out my negativity because it always feel like my negativity is sealed off and even more negative and even more hurt because they treat my negativity like a terrible dark evil weapon thats uncalled for thats short sighted that it mean but i just want to get rid of my negativity that i have of them so i can finally make way and be open to getting rid of my trauma and painful stuff i went through that weighs me down way more about the stuff i went through when i first developed schizophrenia thing is it multiple thing if i just share my schizophrenia trauma with them they act like im attacking them and if i share my trauma from dealing with them because they yelled at me and called me name at critical moment of the time when i wa very delusional and very confused the voice were very evil attacking me and telling me painful thing and threatening me and showing me terrible stuff that i didnt want to look at in my imagination while my parent were forward ahead of me staring at me sternly yelling at me calling me a crybaby for not doing the stuff i needed to do then next day they would be sitting regularly down and by talk to me normally like hey sage like nothing happened the other day like they didnt add to yesterday mental anguish and i go and carry that hurt for month then year and i then finally bring it up after i dwelled on it for year because i couldnt think properly i wa dysfunctional for year and it ha become a big deal with me it ha become a big painful thing sitting in my mind something ive waited to be released from at first i brought my hurt up crudely so they thought it didnt really matter and it hurt me but a time had went on i could just explain and think better they still thought it didnt matter which very hurt me they thought that i needed to shut my negativity down that i needed to stop bringing up my pain because thats the real problem in all this apparently not the fact that im full of trauma all the time and im lonely all the time getting my only comfort from watching tv and anime for four year and not getting any real love i feel like im stuck on a hamster wheel being my family hamster while my family are fully functioning human who live in a actual house while i live in a cage which is my body and my mind trying to fix himself a best

much trauma but nothing out of the ordinary then i got in a room with kate we grew close very fast then belle came and we three got close belle had a boyfriend named theo who wa a couple year older once another patient told me that theo had told him that he raped a girl once we thought he wa just making fun well he wasnt he did push me against a wall had a knife in his hand  i froze and he didnt let go of me but when another patient came he let go told me he wa just kidding and smiled i told no one and didnt thought it wa a big of a deal kate wa allowed outside alone i wa supposed to join her and had a bad feeling but wa to tired she didnt came back and another patient took me aside and said that he met kate and theo kate told him that theo is forcing her and to get me fast but to tell no one else i ran outside i got in trouble afterwards but she wa already gone she wa missing for  week and we couldnt make contact with her everyone thought she ran away again she did twice i didnt know what to do when she came back she wa a mess she told me that theo and another man raped her again and again after they forced her to go with them they had a knife and she wa scared she she asked me not to tell anyone and i didnt again i told no one but started lying about beeing raped too i thought if i knew how the therapist would treat me i could treat her to help her also i wanted it to be me not her she went through enough it shouldve been me because i shouldve been outside with herkate wa admitted to another psych ward after finally telling our therapist what happened and i wa released we still were very close i came back to the psych ward because i wa still depressedamp refused to go to school a patient from the first stay athe the psych ward which i wa also very close wa in love with me i tried to be very gentle but honest i didnt love her back she tried to kill herself after that another time she cut  my name in her arm very deep and send me a photo kate called me to tell me that she wa about to kill herself at the end she called her mom and got back to psych war at the same time i got a new roommate she told me that she got sexual abused by her father and that they would met in court she had flashback where she screamed and afterwards wanted me to be there for her i did offcause one day she made me promise to never tell anyone what shes now saying to me she told me that her case worker started touching her inappropriately and that she didnt know what to do i also didnt know and wa overwhelmed with so much responsibility and beeing the leader so i told no one again neither did she she wa released a few week later i started to self harm more to lie more and to cause trouble i acted histrionic year later i wa diagnosed with adhdbpdamp severe social anxiety i dont have hpd but surely acted like that for the time period where everything happened and began having nightmare regularly no one ever asked my why i wa acting like this everyone thought i wanted attention maybe i did but mostly i wanted them to ask me so i could tell them what wa happeningit wa my fault i couldve prevented trauma i couldve saved them but i didnt i kept silent and i am ashamed of that i hate myself for it and i feel so guilty it happened  year ago and i have lost contact to everyone i saw kate suffer so bad i knew she wasnt okay i had the gut feeling that something wa off and i shouldve been outside but i wasnt i know what i did wa wrong and that there is nothing i can do to make up for it in my eye i wa always the wrongdoer i wa the one causing pain and kept silent when i shouldve known better they trusted me and i failed them in so many different situation im truly sorry i take full responsibility for my actionsi know it sound like it made up but it isnt i know that psych ward can be fun but ill never forget what happenedwhy im asking is because i told my friend who studying psychology that i dont want a position with responsibility we talked and i said what happened she asked and i told her the whole story she said that i wa a teenager and that it wa the adult position to protect u she said that i said everything without any facial expression and without emotion and shes right i block out every emotion when i talk about it but sometimes this huge wave of guilt shame and powerlessness hit me out of nowhere i still am dreaming of it from time to time she said that i need to talk about it in therapy and that it could be trauma she said that i wa already vulnerable because of my mental state and then got surrounded with trauma im always freezing and there wa so much weight on my shoulder she said but i wasnt abused or hurt i wa just in the middle of it acting like an idiot i dont believe that i can have trauma of that because nothing happened to me i acted wrong i dont have the right to be traumatizedso i wanted to ask here if it possible to have trauma without beeing the one who hurt,anxiety

1023,my traumatic event wasnt horrific but it changed the way i act think feel and even dress in short when i wa  i wa diagnosed with a disorder i definitely didnt have i later confirmed this with a professional my parent were fearmongered into sending me away to a facility thats the gist of it though i could probably write a book about the whole experience before i left i changed and never returned to the way i wa before like a switch wa flipped i became hyper fixated on strength and making myself capable because i felt powerless i guess my belief and value changed extremely quickly i started obsessively going to the gym and going to martial art class both of which ive kept up over two year later i developed this sort of aggressiveness that i still dont know what to do with other than feed into martial art i even dress differently im a woman but ive begun to dress and present more masculine because femininity seems too weak and fragile for someone like me to embrace other than wearing a little makeup and caring for my skin and hair i envy the power and sophistication associated with men clothes i also dont experience any attraction to anyone anymore for a while i exhausted myself trying to figure out why i had changed so drastically so quickly it wasnt until i spoke with a therapist that we pieced together the story and i realized that a large part of who i am wa influenced by that period of time everything i do is running from what i believe to be weakness ive come to accept it and i dont mind who ive become it spurred a thirst for growth and selfdevelopment and gave me a why for everything i do even still the change is almost frightening sometimes i cant empathize or connect with who i wa before shes gone with the past,anxiety

1031,tldr my ptsd is causing needy behavior in my relationship and dont know how to adjust this time of year is especially hard for me i grew up in an extremely abusive household and holiday were prime abuse time so i always have an undercurrent of extra sensitivity in nov and dec it gotten a lot better over the past  year of therapy but it still there i have severe abandonment issue on top of my ptsd trigger i have been majorly struggling in my relationship the past few week weve been together ish month and it definitely starting to settle into a comfortable groove which is good healthy even and we have very open and constructive communication he ha been under a lot of stress due to work and his own family turmoil because of this stress he been more closed off and le talkative he been clear it not me and he still in this for the long haul and is actively working on managing his stress better so it affect u le and honestly he still generally present and making regular time to see me we just arent texting a much and he not being a engaged when we do talk but i feel like i cant really ask more of someone in his circumstance other than what he already doing i know this is high stress time for u both but knowing all of the above logically is not helping me emotionally im a hot damn mess my anxiety is thru the roof because i feel like he lying to me and he is going to break up with me any day my brain is convinced he is going to cut the relationship to handle his overall stress even tho he explicitly told me thats not what he want and he just trying to actively find the right balanceim not a crier in general at all and im finding myself just breaking down and feeling the impending doom of abandonment andor abuse im looking for it my hypervigilance is out of control im being very honest with him about my feeling and where they are coming from i know my emotion are my own responsibility and i cant constantly seek reassurance from him every time im feeling triggered or insecure but how do i cope with this all the time just a small difference in tone inflection and im thinking he will ghost and honestly it not just him it happening with work friend etc it just coming out most prominently in my romantic relationship wtf more can i do im doing all my self care trick telling myself all the logical thing telling myself im safe over and over my doctor upped my anxiety med which ha helped but not enough im having meltdown and flashback every day tho no one know that part i am not sleeping bc if nightmare doe anyone else deal with this what do you do to help,anxiety

1033,hey there this is my first post here and my trauma is a bit specific so id like to provide brief context ill keep it a brief a possible and go in little detail of course but tw is in place also for gaslighting later in the post i dont know if thats really what it is but that is the effect that it could have reading itthis happened  year ago i hosted a party at my place with my group of friend it wa fun and at some point people left one by one until just one friend remained we decided to sit in the backyard and chat we bonded really well because we both have some pretty severe mental issue he wa living in a facility at the time due to it we ended up going inside because it wa cold and sat in my room the conversation wa really nice until he said he attracted to me i wa quite confused and needed a moment to think but he started touching me i froze up and the rest just happened to me the weirdest thing is afterwards he went to sleep on my couch i eventually fell asleep a well the next morning he brought me breakfast in bed  i politely ate it which i know now is the fawn response after that he did it to me again i couldnt even move or say anything so i never said no but my entire body wa frozen and i didnt partake in anything i just lay there and hyperventilated and closed my eyeslong story short he texted me to apologise and i said i wanted no contact we ended up talking with my therapist and his there  month later it wa hard but really freeing to be able to tell him what he did to me i told his therapist in the facility to please take this into his treatment i didnt want him to die in jail he ha been suicidal for year i just wanted him to get proper help he expressed his remorse many time and said he understood how much he hurt me and he would do anything i want he had been in that friend group year before i joined i had only been there for a year he had been completely missing and silent in the friend group since it happened and he told me he would keep that up or leave altogether if i wanted even if he wa very isolated and lonely and in a very dark place mentally probably worse than me for the record he didnt specify that at that moment before you think he wa trying to manipulate me with it i just knew through friend who did have contact with him i thought long and hard but realised that wasnt what i wanted i know this is going to be an unpopular take and i really want to make clear i think it is absolutely important to be able to go nc with an abuser and to listen to yourself in that this is really only my decision and story at some point i decided i wanted him to come back a bit maybe that is me being too forgiving and attached but i really stood behind it and wanted to take control to make the decision now not the people that told me to banish him from my life and friend group not the people that told me it wasnt so bad and he didnt mean it i wanted to decide for myselfi texted him at some point said i wanted him to return to the friend group to just not be active in the nsfw channel a that could trigger me it felt really good and i felt like i wa healing even with him active in the server i could communicate with him without feeling anxious or getting flashback even irl at some point a long while later he became active in the nsfw channel again and usually that wa okay for me although i would sometimes get anxious from it so i dont know if that wa the best idea i think part of me just wanted to move on and for thing to be normal i have had fun time with him again and time i forgot it ever happened just for a bitand all felt normal for a while but now i feel incredibly shaken up lately ive been struggling with a lot of thing which is not unusual for me bpd but now it is just a lot at once im struggling at my study in my relationship and with my identity i had more flashback again too a i struggle le with trigger like seeing him or sexual act but rather trigger like feeling out of control or doubting myself and then he texted me i had vented a little bit about ptsd in the friend group which wa probably not the best idea because i know it trigger him and i have other place to vent he dmed me the next day with the followinghug emoji do you really think this situation wa a clear rape it took me a lot of time to not think about it in that way anymore and instead see it a a complicated situation with insufficient communication and me not picking up the sign sorry to be blunt with this it ha been on my mind again the past couple day i also went through a lot of misery because of the situation i dont think i ever really told you because i didnt want you to think i think i am the victim but there is a lot in my past i never told you about that led to thisi immediately panicked when i read this luckily i wa with my fianc who know just what to say and do when i flashback and panic so he helped me im quite insecure about my own judgment and have been gaslit before i dont know if that is what he meant to do here but i started to doubt myself again i never said no and he is autistic too so maybe he really didnt pick up the sign but i learned to trust myself more i actually wrote down everything that happened in painful detail the day after it happened so i would never be made to doubt myself and i learned it shouldnt only be you stop when you hear no it is also you only start when you hear yes the absence of no is not a yesi have absolutely no idea how to go about this it ha been a week since this text and i dont know how to respond i think he is trying to make it more bearable he ha an immense hate for himself and i think accepting he did what he did would push him over the edge a he is now the thing is i just really wish for him to get better but thats not going to work if he ha to twist the fact to be a more likeable person in his mind he need to realise what he did wrong how much he hurt me and that it is rape to be able to work on what the issue really is and learn to prevent it in the future and move past it i wish for him to learn to accept himself and grow a a person even if he ha done a horrible thing even though he ha done a horrible thing because he did i dont want him to try to work and accept himself on a lie i really thought he had come to accept what happened and wa dealing with it a it happened but this made me question all the apology and the misery he ha gone through over the year according to him i just also dont want to tip him over the edge if he hurt himself because i popped this bubble i dont think i could handle that and i wouldnt wish that upon anyonewhat do i doas for my mental health i have been in therapy for  year due to my emotional issue bpd and have also talked about this trauma and got diagnosed with ptsd  year ago my psychologist said the flashback seem to not be a frequent and i seem to recover okayish from them so we never did emdr even when i mentioned we could maybe try i had emdr a a kid for something else and it really helped me im switching psychologist soon due to a move so i want to really push emdr this time too,anxiety

1049,this year i have implemented strong discipline into my lifestyle it wa a hurdle to jump at first and at time after a really bad night intense day etc it can still be super big hurdle  but man damn  i actually have some amazing advice  ok  hear me out this is to do with productivity which for me help a lot so i feel some of you would benefit from this also  critically think about what you have to do in a list with all the po and negative  here  is a broad e g gym neg take  effort po feel great afterwork neg take  effort po get money securityetc etc  when you are feeling unproductive do something productive that is easy for you to do at that time so do whatevers easiest it might sound counterintuitive  but it really work if you do this right and still push yourself by focusing on the critical po and neg here an example in the eye of an artist ok so today i feel like crap  easiest thing i could probably do right now would be to do some lazy artboom  finished art ok i will clean my room because i have a little energy nowor ok i will talk to a phone therapist a i feel i can talk about my emotion clearlybasically the idea is do what is easiest because at every moment something for all of u is easier than something else  key thing is you have to make sure your being productive productivity is key  and it go back to my original title it a hurdle  and the hurdle will always reappear but ive noticed it getting easier every time now that im on a roll and looking more positively in the future also good advice to do with social medium addiction get a strict app blocker  there are heap on android that really work well you can block throughout weekday and then on weekend only allowed min per hour for example not for everyone but figure out what your lucky number are  everything positive is great it all add up discipline ha helped me so much and sacrifice  i honestly reckon a human every  month we should sacrifice something out of our life im going to post an introduction by the way a i understand i may be coming across a ignorant or annoying a ive never spoken on this subreddit before  so i will post an introduction now bye  i wa looking through comment and post you all seem great very good communitypeace and prosper,anxiety

1082,this post is meant to be cathartic and i hope i can find someone who can relate although i dont think i will im a yearold male and never had a girlfriend ive tried so hard since i wa  to date and socialize and it only made thing worse i had sex one time in my life in august of  and it wa so bad i vomited for over an hour i have a long history of trauma starting before i can remember my sister say that when she wa  and i wa  she could hear me screaming so loud in the other room from being disciplined that it scared her i also recently had flashback this summer of my grandmother molesting me when i wa  or  in the nightmare she only had a shirt on and wa sitting directly on my mouth my grandmother had cancer and when it spread to her brain she became a different person i had a therapist beginning in september  she wa the best person in the world to me at one point but she acted very unethically by being flirtatious and overly sexual with her word which a you can imagine i enjoyed at first ill call my former therapist katy but katys behavior triggered a psychosis during that period i became very attracted to her and suddenly  month into therapy in july  a my life wa finally turning around  the thought popped into my head youll probably live to see katy die so the only logical option is to kill yourself what followed wa a hell no doctor ive spoken to ha come across before i wa so suicidal that nothing else mattered and then i started having endless intrusive thought where anytime i looked at someone i would just see them a a rotting corpse for month all i could see in my mind were dead rotting body  everywhere i started to feel a though my own skin and tongue were rotting a well this whole time i kept working and one day i came home completely hopeless and cry to my mother and all she could say wa you constantly talk about yourself my mother devon is a cruel human being who never really had to work because my dad support her financially and let her destroy their bank account with online shopping she ha no compassion up until i wa  i wa raised in a fundamentalist christian cult in new england which wa a complete nightmare i attempted suicide in january  and honestly now i wish i had succeeded a month after i almost died my parent told me i had to leave home because of my behaviori left katys practice in september  after i got sick she became useless and i only stayed in hope that i could repair the relationship to what it wa shortly after we met in  in april  i confronted her about whether or not it wa appropriate for her to joke about me imagining her a a stripper or to masturbate over the phone when she had me call her outside of the session among many other thing she completely flipped out and accused me of slandering her and it wa clear she knew she wa caught and wa trying to cover her track when i left her practice i made the mistake of trying to keep in touch with her because part of me still wanted to keep up the relationship i never got a response recently after talking to katy with my new therapist i came home feeling sick and terrified after remembering everything katy put me through which im leaving out all the detail for length sake i wrote a letter to katy telling her how much damage she caused i then had a no harassment order filed against me the past two week have been hell i didnt show up to court because if i saw her it wouldve made thing worsethe biggest problem is that between my grandmother my own mother and katy the trauma is so severe that i have no sex drive anymore im completely impotent and void of feeling arousal ive been doing emdr since february  and it helped initially but once i started trying to date again and then i moved out of my house again this june it only made thing worse my life ha been riddled with constant severe betrayal at the hand of people who were supposed to love protect and guide me i can feel nothing sexual towards woman anymore and im not gay even though i want to and have wanted a relationship with girl since i wa  but the trauma ha been too severe i also always had an aversion towards vagina and i think it because of my grandmother molestation i performed oral on the girl i had sex with last year and thats what made me throw up i cant even stand when other men joke about wanting pussy and talking about vagina jokingly because it associated with so much grief and pain i think vagina are the grossest thing on earth even though i dont want to think it and i know it going to lead me to suicide one day,anxiety

1135,hi i have ocd and have been going to a therapist for a couple year for it now my ocd is different and it make me have really bad anxiety bc im scared what if it not ocd then basically my ocd revolves around an obsession w rape and sexual assault but instead of it being me doing it to others i have fear that it going to happen to me i wa sexually assaulted in high school but that wa  year ago basically what happened wa i knew this guy we were friend i knew he liked me and i did not like him and before a party where i wa heavily drinking i told my friend not to let anything happen well i got very drunk i wasnt unconscious but extremely drunk and he ended up pushing me up against a car and making out with me out of nowhere i didnt know how to react so i started nervously laughing just to add he wa sober and i wa not anyways he led me up to a bedroom and we did hook up i didnt want to but i just kind of did it anyways a a result of me being  and extremely drunk at the end i wanted to leave and he told me he wanted me to be begging to hav sex with him we did everything but have sex and i got scared he wa extremely pushy and wouldnt let me leave the room and kept trying to force me back on the bed while i kept saying no no no he kept trying to take my clothes off and i tried to defuse the situation by calmly saying i cant have sex with you please stop while trying to get him to put his clothes back on anyways it wa really scary and i saw an out and i literally ran out of the room after this i felt disgusted with myself and knew it wa assault and would watching tv or see something about assault and get really triggered even when i think about it for some reason i tell myself that bc i wa drunk and let it happen it wa acceptable when it wa not  this lead me to the next part where my ocd come inthis wa  ish year after this assault this ocd theme started fourish year ago from today when i read an article about a girl boyfriend raping her this gave me horrible intuitive thought and false memory about my boyfriend i have been with him for  year these thought were so distressing and i couldnt figure out why my mind wa telling me he did something to me when he didnt this lead to the event in obsessing about during this time four year ago i wa reading lot of article about rape and doing a ton of research i wa in an ocd rabbit hole it is so strange that my ocd wa telling me my boyfriend did this instead of the thing that actually happened year ago this is what my ocd is obsessing over  my boyfriend asked me to have sex and i didnt mind if we did but i started getting intrusive thought so i said maybe later a little later he asked if we could put it in and lay there and i said yes sure this wa not coerced or anything and he wasnt badgering me for sex and i wa fine with it anyways we were laying there he didnt start randomly having sex w me honestly i think he wa falling asleep sometimes we put it in and sleep like that tmi lol  and then i asked him are we gonna have sex and he said mm and started moving and initiating i started then getting intrusive thought why didnt he respond to you  you need a yes or no answer  are u allowed to have sex bc u said maybe later etc so i turned towards him and said im confused are we having sex yes or no so we stopped when i asked and he responded sure it feel good to which i responded okay and we continued to have sex well my ocd is warping this event and telling me something horrible happened or that im forgetting something and it keep asking me why i had these intrusive thought during sex and it keep changing the event around and telling me that he started having sex with me before i asked if we were gonna have sex he didnt i initiated the sex by asking it also keep telling me that i have ptsd and i am in denial and these thought are scaring me so much bc i dont think anything bad happened my ocd wa just demanding i get a yes ir no answer which i did i stopped having sex and asked and then chose to continuesomething else that is bothering me about this is that i had an intrusive thought what if this is rape and i literally said to myself no it not and continued on having sex im having extreme anxiety about this and i am in a good relationship and my boyfriend wouldnt ever do that and it causing me a lot of distress it also bothering me that i seem to be the only person with this type of ocd thought if i didnt want to do something i would simply say i dont feel like doing something ive never felt threatened or anything by my boyfriend i wouldnt stop to ask if we were having sex or not get my answer and then continue having sex  i guess i am asking for reassurance that this isnt rape or anything bad and then to tie this in w my past experience in high school im wondering if this is at all making my ocd theme me around these thought and is for some reason accusing my boyfriend who didnt do anything and ha been respectful of my boundary i dont know if bc i didnt really talk about what had happened in h my brain is bringing this up and putting it on consensual situation where im getting triggered bc of what happened in hsplease help me im in a lot of distress and it affecting my relationship to add i did also talk to my boyfriend about all of this a well which did help a lot,anxiety

1143,this post is mostly inspired by the new york law that let rape victim civil sue their rapist  despite how long ago the crime wa i feel like it should be nationwidei had a severe mental breakdown after my rapist started stalking me when i tried to leave him i never received a call back from police when i reported year later which i guess is common i had to face the fear instilled in me by the sadistic intimidation from his police department coworkers before i could even report the dating violence the corruption in my case is horrifying the sabotage unheard of i eventually abandoned my job because he lived  minute away from it and wa conceal carrying i received the wrong diagnosis and treatment for year because i told intake i did not know if i had been raped because the intimidation wa so bad including at my first therapist appointment while he wa stalking me it took me three year to finally tell my therapist it is true what tort law say i am owed for medical bill loss of wage pain and suffering because he choose to become a violent criminal and i wa suddenly inconvenient a his victim so he had to become more violent and intimidatingi think successfully applying the law to the fact of the violence would take a lot of stress out of ptsd treatment you would go to every appointment without a lot of the life stress caused by the criminal instead of the criminal only destroying your life he also ha to pay to put it back together again,anxiety

1147,helloi feel like i should share my experience when i wa  i wa in the middle of nowherewilderness during an offroad moto race a rider fell and he wa very badly hurt i did the best i could to help him but i knew that he likely would not make it the few people who were there did virtually nothing they just stared a i tried to save this man an ambulance came then the ambulance got stuck in the sand and so a helicopter wa called the two paramedic were more or le useless i alone performed cpr he died before the helicopter came and by then his head had swollen up so big and his blood wa on my hand he wa a stranger when i wa  my best friend in the whole world my spirit guide my guru my brother got into an accident right in front of me again on a motorcycle in the wilderness  i thought he wa going to be okay we will take you to the hospital and well laugh about it  because we thought the injury were minorish like a concussion maybe some bruised rib i took him into my offroad vehicle and a we drove it wa just him and me i started to realize that he wa not going to be okay it turn out that his vertebra shattered from the crash and severed an artery in his kidney and he bled to death i had to tell his family i had to tell our friend i had to select his casket and get his body across the border so he could be buried in his hometown in the u i remember the fly swarming on his face and how the mexican police tried to stop me from putting a blanket on him to cover him from the fly i have never been so furious i remember how the mexican funeral home lied to u and stole money from u and didnt give him the casket we paid for i remember how the mexican government wouldnt release his body until we paid a bribe i remember how his lifeless body just laid there in the sun surrounded by skinny stray dog and broken bottle and i just wanted to crack the earth open and to let the sun swallow me to be obliterated evaporated vaporized i felt like a sandcastle losing my shape after wave after wave after wave  like somehow my sanity wa actuallydemonstrably warped by event in real time  when i wa about  by chance i wa helping someone who had just gotten into a car accident on a highway by a ramp it wa around am out of nowhere a drunk driver hit the wall of the ramp going at least mph i went to help there were two people in the car i wa able to pull one out with the help of another bystander who left before the police arrived the truck caught fire and i could not help the person inside but they were probably dead anyway both people died the one in the car wa completely incinerated even here in the u the cop did little to help i remember being surrounded by cop and i wa the one doing cpr trying to help this guy they just watched me by this burning truck at night every time i wa trying to save someone i had always in the front of my mind that i had to do my best to give them dignity i made sure their face didnt get dirty from the floor or didnt get banged up to try and preserve them for an opencasket funeral for their family i opened my heart and wa flooded with compassion to try and ease their passage im not a firstresponder or emt or paramedic or doctor i wa just at the wrong place at the wrong time or maybe it wa the right place at the right time i dont know i have grown so much and went through so much pain but now i feel an immense sensitivity to the beauty and value of all life after a very long dark period i can say with certainty that i love all living being and that i forgive in my heart everyone who watched and did nothing to help ptsd broke me but therapy meditation love and support from my family and my ex and one very spiritual mushroom trip helped transform me helped me attain tranquility and confidence and quiet strength that i couldnt imagine living without i am in a top law school now on a scholarship last semester i wa almost top in my class i landed my dream job last summer i promise it get better i remember there wa a time in my life when it felt like i wa always wearing a pair of glass where the lens had superimposed an image of my best friend face covered in fly fly on his open and lifeless eye or a head swollen like a watermelon or a truck on fire at night with someone inside i couldnt get the image out of my sight i wanted to die i would wake up fucking jacked up with adrenaline one time i almost knocked my grandmother the fuck out when she came to my room one day to check up on me and i had been asleep i laugh about it now but only because i didnt actually hit her if i had connected i could have killed her and that would have been horrible i dont even want to think about that possibility i wish i could have written a better more thoughtout post but this will have to do i promise it get better just be kind to yourself and open your heart to the beauty of the universe sorry if that sound cliche also this holy text wa very useful in my recovery you can read it all in a day

1161,equality of opportunity is something i think about a lot since i moved out two year ago it like going to university and just starting to realize the difference between you and the people around you the way of speaking the way they approach higher education the support they get from home i think nowadays we often think about equality of oppurtunity a that people from different ethnicity and background can achieve anything andwe think about thing like the financial situation the neighbourhood or race but we dont think about mental health abuse childhood trauma an application for university can look perfectly fine you come form a middle class backgroud you helped the poor you played a sport youve achieved good mark great but doe that set you up for life universtiy your work life when i went to uni what ive never thought is that i would struggly mentaly a much a i do ive never thought i would suffer from cpts education wa always a mean to me to escape a abusive household to build a better life and one would imagine leaving an abusive situation would end it all  how naive it the realization that you arent a far a you can see like most people around you that you go home and cry for five hour that you struggle to get rest because you dont want to be alone with your thought that some topic start triggering you and you want to leave the situation so badly you just cant enjoy your life at universityyou know there are people that say that being abused and suffering mentality can give you a certain perspective to look on the world that it differs you from other people it make you special if you do something good you achieved all this because you were abused and then there are the people that say you achieved it despite of it that your struggle against your situation made you a strong character martin luther once wished for people being judged by the content of their character but what if your character is tangled up in the abuse you suffered that it isnt your fault that someone deceided to abuse you mentally physically or sexually or that a person decided to threaten you with a gun or you know whatever traumatized you it not your fault it really isnt the trauna mix itself up with your character and the way you act and you either address it head on or you leave it however it shape you and your approach to lifein my country there are opportunity opportunity to prolong your study because of your mental health to have a break for one or even two semester but the people that can grant you a stipent or your future employer will look at this gap this empty gap you left in your cv they will look up to you and askwhat did you do during this time,anxiety

1218,it wa their big brain idea to try to wake me up in the morning i still go into instant rage mode when anyone wake me up harshly not great stuffafter the chris hitchens video experiment i started learning more about what waterboarding actually iswhen someone explained why it wa so bad it clicked thats pretty much the same experience i had it wa a little vindicating to see everyone agreeing that that experience is fucking awful tbhbeing hit and dragged around had le of an impact on me in the long run you can steel yourself for those this wa just being blindsided over and over again while deliriously mostlyasleepbut i still felt like maybe i wa being overdramatic there a few difference in methodology between what my parent did and the literal fucking torture technique that made witness cry so i tried out the oneperson diy suggestion for waterboarding yourself cloth over the face lying down choking on waterfelt the same still sucksbut a few minute later i wa likewell i didnt use freezing water my parent did they probably do when torturing people not really a fair comparison thenso i waterboarded myself againfelt the same still suck it took a while to convince myself to try round  that freezing factor is like being physically punched i fucking hated it and still doonly now im likewell maybe im still doing it wrong i should get another person involved like hitchens did be tied down like with actual waterboarding sure i couldnt just call it off when i wa a kid either but i wasnt physically restrained so maybe being able to jump up fighting is the defining sanitysaving factor and make this whole comparison unfairlets just say that asking people to help waterboard me is not going wellthe first question is why the answer isnt good and idk just curious isnt cutting iti guess i just need some kind of closure about this advice whateverat this rate im going to end up calling up dishonored people who used to work in correction and going can you waterboard me for realism im doing itfor a school project no im not in school stop asking so many question are you in or what,anxiety

1229,hi so  ha been rough but this one might take the cakemy oldest brother abused me when i wa age  i never spoke about it i dealt with it my own way and confronting him about it wouldnt give me anything my older brother called me today to let me know my oldest brother half brother wa also abused plan on confronting him about it and ha already begun talking about it with their mutual family membersnow it is on my older brother to let my parent know since im out of state my parent know something happened to me but they dont know what or who but i know after theyre told about the other victim they will figure it out ive let my brother know that if they want to talk about it or ask about it that i am not ready to talk about it at all and i probably never will be the reason my older brother know is because he wa present for it i put no blame on him he wa just a young a i wa and didnt understand what wa happening i really dont know what im feeling im numb im worried for me my dad and even a bit for my oldest brother even though i shouldnt im feeling very very dissociated from the situation to be honest,anxiety

1231,so about a week ago i experienced my first flashback followed by two others within the span of an hour it felt like i had been teleported into the past all the sens were exactly the same these consecutive flashback were all revolving around the same event just at different key stage of said event another few issue worthy of noting is that i am prone to dpdr episode and have experienced a lot of amnesia due to those episode i also had completely buried that event from memory yet now i feel broken my entire mindset ha been changed and i have found myself to be extremely irritable i feel terribly guilty i can barely look most people in the eye anymore a few thing that make me uncertain are that it been near  year since the event i wa taken back to and i had previously thought i had accepted it also that after the first  flashback a lot of the amnesia ha cleared and i am starting to get bidaily flashback to other event similar to the first i also dont seem to move during these flashback other than grinding my teeth despite making what feel like conscious movement in the flashback themselves doe this sound anything like ptsd i do have autism and anxiety aswell and had preveously chalked up my dissociative episode to that mixture but now im unsure i had hallucinated before but they had nothing to do with the event and occured during anxious breakdown which i wa not experiencing at the time of the flashback those hallucination also only affected my actual surroundings they didnt completely change them into a new setting altogether im just a bit lost now to be honest god know the amount of post similar to this so im sorry for adding to the pile but i want to be somewhat sure before seeking diagnosis im also trying to be a mindful a possible not to mention too much detail but i truthfully have no idea how sensitive people may be so i also apologise if ive mistagged it a being potentially triggering if there are any further question that may assist in determining if this may be ptsd please ask i have probably left something important out many thanks for any advice given,anxiety

1236,a sa happened to me almost a year ago and it wa really confusing and upsetting especially since the person who did it wa close to meat first i spent a lot of time thinking about it and cry and then at some point i stopped being able to cry and started bottling everything up cry wa my main coping mechanism and i guess it just doesnt work anymoreive been getting angrier and angrier ive had a few meltdown this year where something overwhelming happened and i became really destructive throwing and breaking thing hitting myself to calm down screaming etc i feel really crazy and it hard to calm down ive never acted this way before in my life not even when i wa a little kid so i dont think im wrong in thinking it ha to do with the stress of dealing with a sa the last few month whenever i tried to masturbate i ended up cry and freaking out and couldnt get the thought of what happened out of my headthe other night i think i had a panic attack my mind drifted to what happened for just a second while i wa lying in bed and i started hyperventilating and cry i sat myself up and forced myself to look around my room at the color of everything and tried my best to breathe deeply and it helped stop it rather quicklyi think it mightve been an emotional flashback or just a panic attack im not really sure but it scared the hell out of me ive always felt like im faking it and over exaggerating my feeling but having a full blown panic attack where i literally couldnt breathe that made me realize i might legitimately have ptsdim mostly asking for validation i guess of course going to a therapist will help me sort out these confusing feeling but im really hoping someone with experience can help me understand what could be going on with me ive read it can take awhile for ptsd to develop and to me it seems this might be happening,anxiety

1240,good morning everyone from where i am anyway just have a good onei am currently having a massive anxiety attack information finding is my coping skillobsession i absolutely  cannot stop myself from digging at something until i find out the why mostly because problem in my life keep popping upsevere one i might addand this is how i survived so now in the more mundane situation my brain ha interwoven the anxiety and panic with repeated occurrence of mundane annoyance with extreme reaction cry uncontrollably and ultimately suicidal compulsion i do not want to rid myself of curiosityits a fun soothing activity to engage in but the more i find out the more upset i get then it isnt so soothing anymore but i cant get rid of this trait either a it ha really helped me survive on repeated occasion like feeling unsafe with my violent ex and methodically finding out all the information to support it which ultimately freed me from him but also scarred me further in the process  it is common to say lower your expectation should i lower my expectation when i know that there is something that is causing me pain today my apartment complex triggered me ive had numerous problem from my apartment flooding with sewage visible carpet tack on the floor and the complex fire alarm specifically i am complaining about the fire alarm today over the last two year ive lived here it ha gone off numerous time with a highpitched squeal they tell me that no one but the company itself can turn it off and they arent open overnightits not an emergency i have migraine with aura i lose anywhere from a quarter to threefourths of my vision sometimes it sound and light sensitive yet they dont consider it a health emergency for the fire alarm which ha a grounding fault thats screeching for hour on end thats causing my migraine i also get nauseated with these previously i vomit with my migraine fortunately i haven t had any of those episode in a whilebut i try to maintain quiet for exactly this reason hell i dont even listen to music that often and i actually like bassy song i also have several other physical ailment in addition to my migraine that compound eg fibromyalgia i am honestly so tired of trying to explain that youre triggering me it exhausting to have to relive it over and over again and on the flip side they dont know theyre triggering me then theyre triggered that im triggered and then i panic and then i cry because i dont want anyone to be upset i dont want my head to hurt how do you handle this post traumatic purgatory i dont want to be a karen but i feel like i have so many small complaint that have mounted into big one and i get treated le than human i mean i just asked for someone to stop the screeching anyone deserves that much especially when there isnt a fire at this point ive threatened to bring in the city and the fire department but i hate doing that i really really effing do i hate cry i hate being angry i dont care even if they would give me the key to turn it off though i know they probably legally cant if theyd just give me some sort of agency instead of lauding their power over me i want teamwork but everyone think im not a team player even when i offer to do extra work stuff that i really honestly shouldnt have to do since it supposed to be covered in my rent i always always ask nicely first and offer to help in anyway i canand then i end up just a mess because they think im being a straight up asshole i dont know what to do anymore when it get bad it trigger my suicidal thought im fine right now and im with someone please dont sic the bot on me it almost ptsdinducing in itself at this point it just a hollow a someone saying get help a if i havent already sometimes i wonder if the neurological connection are so ingrained ill ever be able to work again simple situation like this cause me to spiral and company are not sympathetic to break down just because youve asked a lot nicely and still didnt get what you needed to do your job corporation dont care and i shouldnt but thats not how my ptsd work im so sick of it  im so isolated from it too  i have no one to talk to about it because ive had numerous therapist tell me that i only have depression after reading this subreddit the numerous scientific article on cptsd and my degree im certain i have it im able to pinpoint exactly why i react the way i do and i also recognize that some of my memory may be false for example my grandfather dying and coming back to life at the morgue i honest to god cant remember if that happened or not i do remember that he laid down and seemingly died from his copd on the facedown on the floor i remember him surviving that and having to go to work still a month after my grandmother died then he did it again and didnt make it this memory is probably true and i know ive had nightmare about the fake memory but it so real and close to the real memory i actually get distressed about remembering it incorrectly and there are numerous other example of this most of the time therapist shrug their shoulder and say thats weird yeah it a symptom i also have undiagnosed ocd terrible skin picking to the point of freely bleeding nailbeds an obsession with suicide that i just recently acknowledgedi just dont know it so hard to get around therapist preconceived notion that they know better despite speaking to an educated patient i educated myself so i could get the right treatment so i could break free i wasnt doom scrolling i guess this became a rant but it kind of a discussion and question i really would like to know your tip and trick on dealing with factfinding compulsion i cant move on until i read about my problem and figure out a solution and then i become so disenamored when i dont have the power to test my solution my doctor hate this about me anyone who come into contact hate this about me i feel so alone anymore especially after my family died i alienate people and people alienate me my friend shut down emotionally and started calling me mentally ill every time i requested that we not go out into the pandemic and eat at restaurant my mother died from covid and i got super sick too they wouldnt talk to me but said they were my best friend and family to someone who ha no family that meant so much to me but then they wouldnt talk to me like go month on end without messaging my happiness isnt their responsibility but they told me they were family and i thought that meant we cared about how each other wa doing it really make me feel better when people act like they trust me and they basically said that i wa trying to find out information to sharpen my blade to use it against them and thats their traumaand thats when i realized that it so difficult to find people whose trauma play well with one and another im so tired i have my partner and they understands me i just dont have anyone else and not for a lack of trying im so so tired of going through the ups and down ive never experienced life without ptsd cant say a much for the earlier year of life due to natural fogginess and it likewhy do i try ampxbalso ive been trying to treat myself but it hard to watch myself from the outside unless i start disassociating and thats not a good state to do psychological archaeology,anxiety

reasonhigh school didnt helpon top of home having racked up year a a dysfunctional microcosmic battlefield to the point where the wood outside were the only comfortable piece of it left my schedule wa packed tighter than it ever shouldve been id have a hell of a time getting to sleep each night maybe finally manage to get a few hour then have to be up at the crack of dawn latherrinserepeatthat combination blew up the sleep issue from frustrating and concerning to scarily out of controli had to catch scrap of sleep by leaning against the wall in the shower slept on the ride to school through class wa physically ill felt like death went through my morning routine halfconscious after a while i developed a weirdly uncanny ability to turn any alarm clock off while still dead asleepbio parent

himself scarce a needed did a instructed and blamed said child for provoking hernot hard to see where this is going got sick of having to wake me up to get ready understandablebut instead of taking me to the doc to figure out wtf wa going on letting me oversleep and deal with the consequencesor anything else that youd think one would do to handle thatshe and  had a brilliant ideathey decided to start dumping bucket of ice water over my face and throwing them over my bodyinstant wakeup callexcept actually nobecause i wa still so involuntarily mostlydead in the morning that it just felt like blindingly sudden incomprehensible physical blow to my entire body over and over again water down my nose down my neck smothered in suddenlyfreezingwet cover choking instinctively trying to curl up while they tried to rip the cover off so there wa no shield against the drenching and iceyou may be thinking gt parrotdude this isnt comparable bit overdramatic really waterboarding includes a fear of death and being tied down you couldve just gotten out of bed and the situation wouldve stopped totally different story it not like you thought youd actually suffocate you know how waterboarding includes pausing inbetween pouring so they dont actually suffocate yeah i didnt get that sometimes move or drown you know why i knew they wouldnt go far enough to kill me because i knew they wouldnt damage their reputation thats it i wa a minor not exactly a fucking trained soldier i wa so exhausted delirious and freezing that i needed at least ten minute of sitting and staring blankly to actually wake up enough to understand where i wa and what wa going on in the meantime this experience wa just an incomprehensible deluge of being hit over and overand beyond all of thati recently saw a chris hitchen video where he went through an experiment to simulate waterboardingi wa curious i wanted to understand what hed experienced so i gave it a go tooand i justidkbecause it didnt feel all that differentdifferent in that it meant being restrained physically instead of by sheer uncomprehending jumbled confusionsame suffocating feeling same spluttering same trying to hold my breath same pain in the throat same instant panicand you know what get mei couldnt convince myself to do it with freezing cold water again i just couldnt never againi tried looking around online to see what the general consensus is on how bad this particularly instance of shitty parenting wasi couldnt even fucking find many people asking about it just a lot of people asking about throwing glass of water at each otherbut the one i did find is justyeahgt dear m faull my husband throw cold water in our yearold son face when he ha a tantrum he claim this approach get the tantrum to stop without resorting to physically harsh tactic afterward our son cry himself to sleep and my husband feel successful could you comment on the possible consequence of throwing water in a young child face  a momgt dear mom think about a time in your life when youve been most angry now think about how much more angry youd be if someone threw water in your face maybe youd lash out at the perpetrator maybe youd be subdued outwardly but inwardly youd seethe with ragegt it important for your spouse to understand just because the outward sign of anger stop when your son get a face full of water doesnt mean the anger end it go somewhereand thatsrealthats exactly what happenedi started raging out reactively in that mostlyunconscious state id jump up ready to fight whoever wa throwing the water roaring thing at them while still unconscious i cant put into word how blind automatic and pure the rage isthat post about the  year old make me weirdly sadthis affected me more than being hit a a little kid dragged around by the hairarmetc and a whole lot of other stuff that people usually take more seriouslyi still dont do well with being woken up roughly it been over a decade and it still ruin the entire day for me im angry and on edge for the rest of that day lingeringly hurtif im right to call a spadeits been vindicating to see people acknowledge that it actually really terrible to have water dumped over your head for way too long and not be able to stop iti dont really know what to say about any of thisi wish they had cared more about whether i wa okay than whether i wa jumping through all the hoop in my life on time,anxiety

1285,my partner of well over a year is about halfway through their prolonged exposure therapy for ptsd i wa told that the therapy process would last a few month and that those few month would be especially difficult since my partner is actively dealing with memory of their trauma every day it impacted a few thing with the last couple week being trying for the both of u them in term of what theyre going through and i trying to cope with how it is impacting u right now recently ive felt like some need of mine arent being met in the way i need them to be and accepting that my partner cant fulfill them right now due to what theyre going through is hardenergy ha been low across the board lately and i feel like that feeling of intimacy and connection ha been severely lacking it usually isnt so this change is hard im trying not to blame them for this a it not directly their fault my anxiety and tendency to overthink mixed with my past negative relationship ha made me feel like it my fault or that im a nuisance and also have anxiety that this behavior of theirs will be permanent  although it been difficult for both of u i am so proud of them for getting the help they need to be better really we talk about this sometimes although im usually cry when we discus this issue to put it plainly i am just struggling with accepting with the hardship of the recovery they express to me that they wish the trauma didnt exist in the first place so they could really love me in the way they want to depressing yes but i love them dearly and want to be a supportive a i can while they get better is there anyone with ptsd that could help me see this situation differently and maybe not take it so personally any tip word of advice or reassurance,anxiety

1298,i grew up in a country in the middle east now in the state and a a child i wa always so nervous and scared that something catastrophic would happen this is due to living in a war zone country and because my father wa extremely abusive to my  brother including my autistic brother he would beat them very aggressively whenever they made a mistake i grew up terrified of making mistake fearing that the same outcome would happen to me i pleased my dad and did what he wanted all the time my mom and dad were always fighting so badly and would always talk about getting separated mainly dad would tell mom that he going to leave her and he would tell me over and over again that he doesnt love her and he going to leave her just to see my reaction and then he would laugh and tell me that he wont do that now a a result of that every time my husband and i have an argument i fear that this is going to be the end my brother told me that when i wa about a year and a half my dad beat mom so badly that my brother had to intervene to stop him what i am noticing now is that every time i have a child i get a depressive episode right around when they are a year and a half i start recalling childhood memory and i start feeling excruciating emotional pain my father wanted to build his business and got himself into a lot of debt specifically with loan shark at the age of  we escaped the country suddenly fearing that the loan shark would harm u since dad couldnt pay off the huge amount of interest he owed him i left everyone i know behind thinking that i will never see anyone again and i wa not allowed to tell anyone about our escape so we escaped to the state in  mom and my two brother went back to our country after one month of being here to clear thing up and negotiate with the loan shark and i stayed with my father and one more brother in the state it wa so traumatic for me and i had so much anger in me one day i lashed out at my father even though he wa so so depressed and i told him that my pain wa all his fault he tried to hit me but my brother stopped him that wa his first attempt of hitting me anyways we ended up all going back to the middle east after one year and right when i went back  mom told me deliberately that my father ha been cheating on her with his secretary whom i knew well and loved since i wa a child she also told me that people are gossiping that he ha a girl from her that wa so so painful for me to hear but the worst of it all is that they put me in the middle of their relationship and mom asked me directly to fix her marriage dad would talk about mom to me and mom would do the same about dad i wa  at the time i took it on a big responsibility and now looking back i believe that i started developing relationship ocd at the time my dad went crazier at the time and he started following u everywhere he even put a recorder in my car and in mom s car to spy on u he found out that i secretly have a boyfriend and followed me one time to find me sitting with him at starbucks having coffee i tried talking to him when i saw him but he turned his back at me and left i knew i wa in big trouble so when i went back home i found him waiting for me and he immediately started beating me and kicking me badly that i wa on the floor helpless between his kick and slap i wa bruised all over mom tried to stop him but she wa so scared of him he then took away my car and my freedom at the time he would call me every hour to see where i wa even when i wa in college the problem wa that they also wanted me to apologize to dad for being at starbucks with my bf even though i did nothing wrong this had been the trend in my family that i should apologize to the elder even when i wa not at fault two year of hell at home passed and then i left to the state to finish my graduate degree thats when i slowly started seeking help and began to breathe again also my father started changing right around the time i left he fixed all the financial issue he had and he apologized to me for the financial mistake he had made and what that caused u my dad is much kinder now and so so generous with u now but the childhood abuse and the physical abuse that i received a an adult have been done i feel that the trauma ha been deeply engraved in my heart i have developed ocd ptsd which i havent worked though yet every few year i get triggered and relive the pain shame and hurt i have endured and fall into depressive episode my husband had such peaceful childhood and i am truly so happy and grateful for it but when i look around and see that everyone around me talk about their childhood with grace i feel deep sadness and loneliness in my experience sometimes and it trigger painful memory to me i am on high antidepressant but i dont think they are helping me with ptsd since i rejected working through my abusive experience before i did therapy for  year but i wa too ashamed to talk badly about my dad i defended him a lot i even feel guilty writing this a i know that he truly love me  yesterday i had a breakdown and felt how much i wa unloved at time and abused and felt so unworthy and it wa so so so painful for me to experience it so rawly for the first time in my life i feel like my childhood wa so confusing i either felt so much love yet so so much fear of screwing up for if i did then love would be taken away from me through physical abusemy mother wa somewhat emotionally abusive too she wa extremely critical nothing wa ever good enough and she did hit me and my brother on multiple occasion but she wa not nearly a abusive a dad i think she wa extremely emotionally abusive to me when she asked me to fix her marriage which no one could ever do for anyone else mom wa also a victim of domestic abuse by my father and of her parentsi wa also in a catholic school and wa hit one time in front of the entire class because i made a mistake in math it wa humiliating and painful to experience a a  year old i wa looked down at for not being a successful a my peer and i never felt validated for being smart beautiful and for being loved i do understand why my parent are the way they are they both grew up in a very physically and emotionally abusive household my father wa in his s when his mom hit him in front of me but that doesnt lessen the amount of pain that wa caused to me and my brother and the mistake that they have made towards uswhats really hard for me is that when i confronted my father about beating me he said that he doesnt remember and when i confronted my mother about putting all the responsibility on a  year old to fix her marriage she said that kid are capable of fixing their parent marriage so i wa never validated and they never apologized to me for the first time in  year i feel like a victim of abuse and i am saying it here out loud because i feel like i owe some compassion and kindness to myself i so love my parent and would do anything for them but they are also the people that hurt me the most in my life and i am relearning love through my husband and my kid but the trauma hurt and pain is so deep it took me  year to talk about this so i truly thank you so much for listening to me,anxiety

1343,hello i have a question that is very important to me for a long time eight month if it matter i wa verbally abused bullied ridiculed psychologically and sometimes physically abused by someone i am a boy and these abuse were repeated without a single day of rest and in a continuous and intense manner also i consider my own emotional sensitivity and the problem i have had in other place and even other time in the degree of impact of this problem on me another important item wa that i wa in some kind of predicament i had no escape no solution no escape no defense i seriously wanted to kill my partner he wa a very strange case because he also used all his strength and energy in an unusual way to hurt me the pressure of anxiety in me had increased so much that my mind saw itself in a state of death threat every day i endured so much pressure that many time i felt that i wa not in reality everyone in the family wa against me at the same time my mother accused me of sexually harming my sister who wa  year old at the time and my father believed her for a long time i wa against the whole world in the most extreme degree of pressure without the slightest relief or solution all my anxiety and pressure could only turn into thinking i used to think obsessively from the time i woke up until the end of the night thought that never solved my problem and only brought me to the verge of a nervous breakdown these thought were mostly about finding a solution analyzing the situation etc which always ended in failure so on top of all that pressure i got a deep frustration inside me because i made a thousand solution for myself all of which failed these event happened in the tenth year of school but after breaking up with said person nothing improved and maybe everything got worse i felt the same pressure every day it wa a if that person had moved into my mind he is still there after  year i experience those feeling towards every stimulus and thought towards the world towards myself it like that infinite blackness ha become a part of me without thinking about that person and that era or that they exist i feel the feeling and pressure of that person and that era i am also afraid of repeating the past of course similar incident have been repeated for example two year ago my parent kept me at home for almost a year because they found out that i wa consuming marijuana and alcohol and did not let me go out they forced me to study this era reminds me of that old era in my mind and i experienced intense emotion and predicament during this era a well this pressure ha caused many thing over the year the most lasting result of which are obsession and mood problem cycle and anger i experience very strong emotion and i really think that i have no clear identity nothing in me is stable i became very religious at least twice a day for a year and after that i became very atheist i am very irritable i always see myself under threat i think that one day i am going to be oppressed in a very severe way and i know that if this happens i will not be able to do anything a it did not happen in the past i will not even be able to show up i dont have it through talking i pour everything into myself i think that at any moment someone might enter my room and torture me or kill my family i see myself a very ineffective and frustrated and i have infinite anger towards people and the world and i am defenseless towards them while in the depth of my being there is a very pure and kind light i have been on haldol clomipramine depakine and asentra for a year they may have numbed me but i dont want them i dont want this blackness what should i do this text wa not supposed to be so long my main question wa i wanted to ask if the cure could be for me to become a fighter to become someone who would beat people like that boy so much if he met them to die because i feel that going wild is the only thing that can satisfy the suppressed blackness inside me when my father say bad word to me or even look at me badly i want to curse him so much and hit him on the head with a hammer so that he tell me i wa wrong please have mercy on me i like to do justice to myself i want to torture people who make me think im in the dark but i know that this is not true at all besides i am a good person but this anger and this darkness is so strong inside me so much that it paralyzes me he torture me and i dont know what to do with it so one of my question wa is going wild is the right solution for me to heal given that my frustration is so deep and maybe that solution will make me feel like i can win or do you think that too it is one of the trick of my mind and there is a solution that is wrong like thousand of other solution which is the same in my opinion and apart from that i cant be this kind of person at all even if i want to i cant the second question is what should i do forgive me for this long text and also for the bad translation because it wa done with google translate goodbye,anxiety

1359, i know it very long but please please read it once basically i have these issue burnoutdepressionundiagnosed  cptsdundiagnosed  parental abuse and neglect  sai am currently a  year old male now ever since i wa in class  ie  when i wa  year old a of now am  from last  year i have huge problem in my family  basically my so called biological father started cheating on my mom  year ago with some another lady  we regularly used to experience physical violence  emotional abuse  financially blackmailing from his side all the thing are still same now nothing ha changed in last  year except the physical violence because he know know if he laid his hand on me or my mom i would beat the shit out of him the next moment only  but still there are regular fight bw mom and dad and now it mainly verbal  due to all this shit from last  year i had to be always at home and could not leave it due to fear of their fight so  a a kid i wa never able to be friend with anyone from my locality and wa all loner my whole childhood and wa never able to engage in sport because i knew that i had to be there to stop their fight a once i go out they would start fighting like animal and i always had to keep an eye on them and i only had  friend that too from my school who doe not know any thing about this am still very good friend with all  of themat multiple point about  time he even stopped providing u monthly expense and educational fes for me and blackmailed financially all this is still same no change although he is currently providing financially but again blackmail that wont pay my college fee the next year a i would join a college next year and currently it my last year in school basically mom and dad have a common property while both have  ownership of it  dad say that he want to sell it out and if he sell it only then he would pay fund for college but mom say she doe not want to sell it out because she think that he will receive all the money and she doe want to do anything which profit him in any way and he is not even ready to divide the money with her it not that he doe not have enough fund for my college because i know the amount of fund he earns from all his source are enough for my college but want to gain control over his property by blackmailing over my college fee so  both of them are stuck with their ego and the end result would be terrible only for me  i wa always sad and overwhelmed because of all this behavior from last  year and why all this is happening to me  even now i regularly feel overwhelmed about all this now when he stopped providing monthly expense educational fes for me it wa all my mother taking care of the financial stuff she did it once for  month  then  month  again one time for  month and once for  whole year she provided all these expense when i wa  and  year old now whenever i have any argument with her she always brings this point that she took care of my fund multiple time and make me feel guilty and a if am some evil person for disagreeing with her  it could be a simple a if she asks me to go to a store and buy some stuff and i say i will do it later or am tired so can you instead do it she will say that i supported your fund multiple time so  why are you not doing this  if i wake up  hour later than what i wa supposed to she start shouting that she did took care of my fund and i can not even do this  basically for every thing she start bringing this thing that i took care of your expense and this is what you are doing in return now am so  fed up of her i can not even tell about it  she act a if she ha owned me a a person for taking care of my fund  now after hearing this same thing for more than around  or more time and at least  time a day on an average i told her that do not say same thing again and again and i will return your each and every penny once i start earning so quit this behavior now she is even acting more crazy and saying stuff that she did a mistake by taking care of my expense and should have left me on my own because somehow am ungrateful to her and at this point am tired of her and do not even want to look at her face anymore now when i wa around  i wa sexually assaulted and rapd around  time in those  year by my so called biological elder brother  no one know about this thing other than me till now and i probably do not even plan to share it with anyone a of now  every time it happened i wa left completely numbed a if i have lost control over my body and can not do anything to protect myself like being paralyzed for that time period  i hate it that i have to see his face on regular basis i just even hate his name and his sight currently i am in class  i started my jee preparation in class  that is  so basically the issue which i am facing is this for those of you who dont know what jee is it basically a exam in india which is given by student to get admission in collegesuniversities from month of march of this year ie  i feel like having no motivation to study like not only to study but almost no motivation to do any task whether it studyingplaying gameshanging out with friend  eating foodlike my diet ha also become unpredictable some day i eat very le and other time much more than usual and nowadays am also much more on liquid diet than solid diet i dont know why seems like eating food seems to be a too heavy task  do not know why but am drinking coffee in extreme amount now which i never used to drink ever before all this usually i used to sleep from  in night to  in morning but currently am not able to sleep before  in morning like after  i feel tired and exhausted even after doing nothing the whole day so basically somehow even after feeling tired not able to sleep  i feel a if my concentration and ability to focus on a task without my mind being diverted to something else ha been reduced too  earlier i could easily sit for  hour in one session for studying but somehow it seems my focus and concentration ha decreased and i can not sit and study continuously for more than  min so i started following  min study  min break pomodoro methodnow i also dont like the activity and hobby which i liked a lot watching movie  playing game and meeting my friend etc at all and do not enjoy them at all and have no desire to do themnote it is not like that i have decided to do jee under parent pressure or some societal pressure or a if am suddenly scoring le mark in my testsi am confused what in the hell is it maybe it some burnout or depression cause i did several free online depression test and i scored in red area like green area mean le chance yellow area mean medium chance and red area mean high chance and the result are same for burnouts test and cptsd test but i dont fully believe them because i know self diagnose isnt reliable  i feel completely exhausted and overwhelmed mentally  physically and emotionally sometimes i just want to die but not regularly  i just wish to not exist anymore not necessarily to die but not exist like not being born or just to die  but i know that this is not any kind of solution and i have to face all this but i do not know where to go  i now from last  month have anger problem  i would instantly become angry over small thing like if am drinking water and it too hot or too cold it boil my bold  if i have to go eat food i become very angry and think that eating food is such a hard working task which requires too much energy basically smallest of the smallest thing rage me up  note that nobody in my mom or dad family have anger issue and neither did i had any before last  monthsfrom last  month i have not studied any single subject and did not attend my class  i tired to attend my class several time but wa not able to do so due to all this feeling that i have  i have my exam in about  month i do nothing other than scrolling reddit youtube and instagram my whole day  i lie on my bed and not able to do anything at all  i have found that i have started using porn and masturbation  drinking coffee and using social medium a a coping mechanism and to escape from reality at one point i even started smoking but thankfully i wa self aware enough that it would lead to only a downward spiral not only in short term but in a long run too and i wa thankfully able to quit that shit but the worst part about that is you do not even need a single penny to start with it in the initial phase i have developed a love and hate relationship with masturbation because it always give me flashback of the sa sometimes i have some insane level of trust issue too  like even if i go to some shop to buy some good i doubt the shopkeeper  like what if shopkeeper is on purpose giving me some expired good to harm me or the chemist is giving me expired medicine to harm me even if they are not expired in reality  although i know that at that point it just that am overthinking too much and just not think much and am able to calm down myself after some time but at the moment it seems too realistic even after rationally knowing that it not real  although these level of trust issue dont happen much but they happen time to time  sometimes i feel weird  like a if someone is watching me from behind and is just standing right behind me or a if i feel very heavy like there is a weight in air which make me feel heavy or a if am watching outside my house from the door and i see some black clothes and black large hat figure which disappears after some time or a if there is someone in my house  this doe happen around  time per week  basically about  time a month  but sometimes nothing happens even for  day straight  i read online that these thing might be hallucinatory psychosis  but i dont believe a i wa not diagnosed with it by some professional psychiatrist  i feel so  tired the whole day that i cant even tell it like am exhausted emotionally and mentally waking up in the morning feel disgusting to me  i hate waking up in the morning and even waking up from my bed seems too much of a difficult task  i feel extremely overwhelmed the moment i wake up  every time i wake up i am either extremely depressed or irritated and frustrated or both  i have also noticed that from last  day about everyday around  time a day sometimes i randomly start to shiver  my body feel cold and i feel a bit of tightness in my chest and upper half of the body and during this sometimes i start to cry on my own and sometimes dont  i cant understand that why all this is happening to me  why i have such a messed up family and why do they act like the way they do like from age to till last month for past year i wa like i have  option either to cry about all this and do absolutely nothing or study and go to college and become independent from them a soon a possible  like i wa overwhelmed about all that in past  year too but not that much where it affected my life too much  like i could cry and be all sad for  day from time to time and then would be able to get over it and act normally after  day because i know that thinking about all that is not going to change any thing and i have to accept all whats happening and have to move beyond it  but now all that hurt me too much every single day from last  month and i cant seem to get over it and now logically thinking that thinking about it will do no good doe not help me anymore  now very regularly i have random flashback about all this  for example if someone start shouting at me i automatically remember my mom shouting brutally at me if i see some sexual joke or meme online on social medium it reminds me about my sa  if i see some post talking about their parent it reminds me of my parent  even seeing their clothes brings back all the memory sometimes if am doing something than randomly out of blue if feel extremely overwhelmed and frustrated  sometimes even when i see other kid enjoying their life it make me sad thinking about myself even after knowing that life isnt fair at all and complaining about it isnt going to do anything good  i have developed some kind of likehate relationship with masturbation too it like i like it when i have any urge but in bw or after it make me feel ashamed and reminds me of everything  sometimes i just feel a if i have void in my heart  now i dont know how to explain it properly but it a feeling of emptiness and loneliness and a void in my heart  i sometimes feel extremely extremely lonely but at the same time i dont think i can make friend a i wa really not able to make any friend since my childhood and had only  friend besides even if i want to i dont want to make any new relation because at the end it going to be a bad one only and i well be left hurt only in long term so  whats the point of actively hurting yourself sometimes when i see other kid i feel jealous and sad that they are enjoying there childhood and teenager year meanwhile am stuck here and have completely wasted my childhood and teenage year which are some of the best part of life for many people  like even after rationally knowing that life is highly unfair and expecting it to be fair is highly naive and immature behavior and i should work on myself to get a better life instead of complaining i cant get over the fact i have completely wasted my first  year of life i wa earlier not much troubled with my mom behavior which i told in above paragraph and neither about that sa from brother because i know that i can not waste my time cry over these and i have to get into a good college and get financially independent a soon a possible in order to get truly free from all this  i mean i wa troubled but just kept ignoring my feeling a i could not afford to become sad and cry over it because i realized that no one in my family is such that i could rely on and i have to build up myself if i want to survive and live because the only thing important wa to get into a college and become independent financially if i want to survive  but i wa regularly troubled with my dad behavior for about  year before i realized that i have to start ignoring him and work on myself because thats the only way to survive and come out alive of this house because he is not going to change and i can not rely on him financially at all and do not know when he will left again and will do what the next moment  i once even started smoking but thankfully i wa enough self aware that it would only lead to a downward spiral in long run and did it only twice and dropped it but now am troubled with all this whether it dad behavior  mom behavior  brother and having this burnout or whatever it is i do not what to do  now  i can not afford therapy since i do not earn any money and once i started talking about all this issue that i told in numbering from  to my mom but she started blaming me and if a am finding excuse to not study  i did not told her fully i talked only about  of it and she took out her sleeper if someone doe not know what this mean then basically here in my country especially middle class family if parent doe not agree with their kid this is their act to show the sleeper and throw it towards you  so  i can not afford therapy  i do not have much time a i have my exam in about  month which is a life changing exam a it decides your collegeuniversity and about  million student give it and only k people get a good college so  it is of utter most priority so  i can not relax much but am not able to study even one single chapter since last  month i have tired various thing but none seems to work i feel too exhausted from all this and even just living is exhausting ,anxiety

1431,twi went through some pretty shitty thing growing up had an abusive and neglecting mom been molested by her boyfriend and forced to be in the same room while they had sex while i slept in a dog bed got bodyshamed by my mom and even witnessed her try to kill herself infront of me all these thing i got through pretty well i thought id think of these thing every now and then if conversation relating to them come up but it wouldnt be a big deal most of the molestation happened when i wa  abuse from toddler to ish im  now so it been a while since anyway ive been getting panic attack and flash back all of a sudden of mainly the molestation the men face will just pop up or ill hear their voice and what they told me and itll be so random and my heart start racing and i feel like im going to puke and in my dream it like i remember more and more from that time thing i havent remembered this entire timei told my psychiatrist about this already been diagnosed with depression and anxiety and after talking in detail with him he diagnosed me with ptsd is it possible for it to just show up like that and be so bad and for me to suddenly remember random detail it just seems so weird,anxiety
1432,i a victim of child abuse wa diagnosed with ptsd earlier this month and saw a psychiatrist today what she said struck me a strange and i wanted to ask the community for their thought tw brief mention of selfharm a a conceptas i experienced prolonged abuse i wa curious about what kind of ptsd i have the psychiatrist replied i have patient with cptsd and they dont cope with it a well a you do theyre in the psych ward and selfharm do you selfharm i explained that i fight the urge and avoid the kitchen but have not instead i cope by drawing or writing she said these are good coping mechanism and her patient with cptsd dont have the selfcontrol to not selfharm and find good coping mechanism this sound like a wild generalization to me she elaborated you display symptom of ptsd but you are able to function and have hobby so id say you have moderate ptsd im very confused is having traditional v complex ptsd determined by how well you manage the symptom the nature of your trauma or both i understand that cptsd is usually harder to deal with but i didnt know that wa a massive diagnosis criterionalso i feel a bit invalidated just because i have a few hobby that bring me joy doesnt mean im not absolutely debilitated by my flashback and nightmare im highfunctioning to a fault so i still manage to hold down the academic fort but everything is harder because i keep dissociating ptsd make me feel like shit  but is that not shitty enoughmaybe because cptsd isnt widespread in the dsm yet there could be confusion on how to diagnose it can anyone who ha dealt w ptsdcptsd weigh in on this i definitely have ptsd and what i call it from here on out may just be semantics but i wanted to run this by you all,anxiety

1449,a an abuse victim and a a plain old student of life i have come to find that i dont do well having sex with someone early on however i have never had a successful relationship that hasnt been sexual i just know that i am filled with anxiety and trepidation everytime a relationship start this way it happening now with a man i really like i didnt want sex he did he ha been initiating it and persuasive and i gave in twice early on then i told him i cant do that that we need to go more slowly he asked how far can he go i said we can do like heavy petting but no intercourse however even this freak me out my heart is telling me that i dont know nor trust him why do we keep doing this but my body know that this is familiar it a good way to ensure that a man stick around for a while and it feel good at time but i know deep down that i feel guilty after it happens pretty much every time i end up feeling used regardless of whether or not thats the case i wish i could cuddle with my boyfriend and not have it turn into sex but it seems like thats hard for him otherwise wouldnt he have pulled it off by now i never initiate btw he always touched me first and then it arousing to me and extremely hard to say no afterjust last night i brought by some free produce from my job and he wa working on a project i wa content to eat and read then he called me over to ask about his dislocated finger and how bad it looked then he began to touch my breast and thats always how it go ill be content just being or sitting next to him or cuddling and then it get sexual and im left feeling like damn is that what im here for and i know he would say no that thats not all but he also said to me a week ago that sex is an important part of a relationship for him and that i have to make some compromise a he ha been very patient and understanding and compromising which he ha been but i cant shake the feeling that our specific value on sex dont line up id rather wait until marriage when im sure that i trust and love the guy and vice versa that he can understand my ptsd and we can get counseling for it and wont abandon me etc which isnt the case when you are just dating someone there is almost no guardrail for me doing this the risk is so high for heartbreak and i know it so it suck because he get what he want which is intimacy and sex but i dont get what i want which is a safe container to be held in and i feel that it my fault i already backpeddled once on sex im afraid that i cant do that again i feel like bare minimum he want to be able to be even slightly physical with me while for me it just doesnt feel safe im sad and wish i didnt have so much fear where are all the men willing to wait i feel that i will be alone forever because ultimately woman just put out and thats the standard now that i dont want to play that game because it hurt me it hard to find someone to be with me i am just feeling so stuck and confused and if he truly understood and respected my desire to not be physical why even ask how far he can go why not ask how he can best support me or something but then i think to myself of course you keep going to his house and expecting him to be able to resist temptation even though i have had that very same situation in the past and we were in fact able to resist it but it feel like thats just not something we are able to do this time and i dont even really want to say we because i am not pushing for this he initiate it literally every single time but i like the intimacy and coziness of being at his house a opposed to being out at a coffee shop where i know it is more appropriate and more safe for me i have never done this the right way so i am looking for help here about how to change my perspective on being able to have normal safe and casual date even if it not with him i am looking for response from people who have also maybe decided to take this path or who just have empathy for my situation casual sex isnt good for me it really hurt me and i am trying desperately to see my way out of this when my past ha been the exact opposite having trouble transitioning,anxiety

1473,hi everyone im relatively new to reddit so hopefully i can get everything right but if i miss something important please lemme knowheres the background sorry if longi had a neardh experience back in  due to a freak accident on a day off while i wa doing some work in a foreign country literally opposite side of the globe this put me in the hospital where i had to get a surgery there plus two more operation once i wa back home with the last one being closer to dh than i would have liked lost half my blood volume and to top it all off i had to relearn how to walk while i wa on bedrest for the next  mo of my life i had an athletic career leading up to this point working towards fulfilling olympic aspiration but a you can imagine all of this forced me to prematurely retire  in the year following i had what i would call relatively mild ptsd symptom i had lot of trouble sleeping heightened anxiety phantom pain in my leg where the operation were done and only one panic attack but i also never suffered nightmaresflashbacks and wa thankfully in a very supportive environment with my family and friend when i realized these symptom werent going away after just over a year i sought out a therapist to help me this wa in early  so all of our session were online but i had  session with my therapist and felt that i had reached the end of my productive time with her and had processed what happened to me she agreed and even removed the diagnosis from my medical record having considered me successfully treatedfastforward to today i wa traveling with a coworkerfriends for work and during some downtime we decided to visit a local museum the museum related to sporting eventsthe olympics and i wa excited to visit it i wa even the one who initially proposed visiting but the entire experience wa what i can only call depressing and walking out of it i felt empty and numb it wa all i could do to get back to my room before breaking down into tear the phantom pain in my leg returned and have persisted all day and anytime im not just tuning out life with youtube video or a book i want to continue cry ive been trying to process it and have at least come to the realization that my emotional distress doesnt seem to be related to the actual event i went through but the repercussion of it and how i wa forced to entirely change my career and life priority the best way i can summarize it is that i feel angry and upset that the choice of when to retire my athletic career wa taken from meampxbso my question is this ptsd rearing it ugly head again or is this just me and my brain being dramaticthe weirdest part about this for me is that i love my life now i wa able to discover a new passion while i wa on bedrest that i started to pursue and thankfully i wa in a good position to follow it for a degree in higher education and am now in graduate school researching a topic i love in a new city i adore with incredibly positive and supportive friend and work colleague in all way my life is better than i ever could have imagined and i even think the career change wa the right move for me i dont regret my choice and honestly feel like i am happier and better off in the career that i am in now than i would have been if i had stayed in competitive athletics which wa not always the greatest for mental health so despite consciously knowing that i am happy and in a better place in my life why do i still feel anger that my choice wa taken from me is that normal is it related to ptsd or is this just me being silly and do i just need to tell my brain to get over myselfany thoughtsadvice would be appreciated,anxiety

1530,spoiler aheadi left a comment on there but the episode he posted today ha absolutely destroyed me i grew up playing the god of war game with my father he always been abusive with narcissistic tendency but he ha so much good and potential within him he taught me so much he put me through so much i despise him but i love him i used to see him in kratos angry volatile selfish filled with his own pain and demon and despite everything he wa he adored his family adored his brother wife and daughter the trauma of losing of them drove him to insane length to be rid of his pain and then to exact gruesome revenge on the god that caused it generational trauma much and then with this new series weve watched him move on learn to trust again build a new family all while still deeply haunted by his demon and riddled with guilt i see that same guilt within my father knowing the pain he caused me the people he hurt and the wrath thats consumed him for year i know he want to be better but the moment that take work and vulnerability he refuse he shuts away his heart again and let himself be toxic because it too hard to confront everything but kratos despite how much he done that his whole life despite how difficult it is to even consider opening up remembering all the people he lost because of it after he see how he push his son away he know he cannot continue he love his son so much and cannot bear the thought of losing him so he work to be better slowly and never perfectly but more and more throughout the series he try he actually fucking apologizes to him he communicates with him he recognizes how he been falling back into his old way he doesnt want to anymore he spends time with him he engages in his interest he encourages himit hurt so fucking much watching this because their relationship is everything ive ever wanted all i wanted wa for my dad to go to therapy apologize and change all i wanted wa for him to realize truly how he hurt me how he pushed me away i sympathize with him so much because i know his father wa even worse and i know it not his fault he only ever learned that but he had so many chance to just grow up and accept that he wa horrible and work to be better to at least fucking tell me he love me directly instead of the guilt tripping emotional manipulation and coldness because now that im grown he not a part of my life anymore and it hurt him i want to trust and love and heal with him  year and i still havent been able to let go of the dad i wanted even though i know that wont ever happen with him and watching this series with jack who wa also such a big part of my childhood and everything behind it and what it always meant to me seeing how kratos ha evolved feel like getting stabbed in the heart i would say i hope i can see that from my dad someday but i know that isnt based on reality and i know i will have to let go of him i guess im just mourning that now,anxiety
1531,    this is a bit long and complicated but here go    my  m relationship with my older sister  f ha always been complicated she is a very difficult manipulative and self centered person a few year ago this ha gotten to the point where it wa just too much for me and i sort of cut contact with her and it wa fairly mutual we still meet whenever the entire family is gathered together but we basically do not communicate and i do not see her a part of my life at all    in the past several year her mental state ha somewhat deteriorated i could sense it even though we were not in touch it wa like she wa in some sort of regression started to act very childish lost her independence and wa very moody and hard to be around even more than before it wa not pleasant to see this but a i said i genuinely do not feel a connection to her anymore it is not a if i am sad for my sister but it is never fun to see that someone is losing grip on their life even if they are not close to you it is also sad to see how this is affecting the rest of my family especially recently    not long ago i found out that her mental state is even worse than i thought she ha severe depression ptsd and she ha developed dissociative personality disorder in order to deal with some trauma in her past probably rape this ha come to the point of her attempting suicide again while i do not see her a part of my life anymore i still cant but feel bad for her just a i would for any individual which ha to go through this    i now arrive to the topic of the post i recently by mistake found a blog which i strongly believe is hers it is in a blogging network that i know she used in the past and a lot of the detail make me quite sure that it is her once i realized this my immediate instinct wa to close the website and try to forget about it but there wa one thing i read there before leaving which made me feel very troubled and i have been thinking about it since    she said that in one of her therapy session a she wa talking about being molested a a child another one of her personality showed up and said that her younger brother me wa also molested this came a a surprise to her a well since she somehow repressed it and only one of her other personality remembered it there were not a lot of additional detail    i do not remember anything like this ever happening to me i cannot imagine any situation where something like this could happen mentally i feel very well and i have never felt any distress or anxiety in sexual context i do not have any sign of trauma and do not think that i wa traumatized i also do not think i have large memory gap from my past even when i try to think who could be the possible molester if it ever could happen i refuse to believe that it wa anyone in my larger family and i consider myself rather observant i am not blind to the possible bad side of people around me and i am quite aware of what they can or cannot do    i am wondering if this is something i should dig into on one hand if something like this did happen to me i would like to know the truth and be able to confront it on the other hand seeing what my sister ha gone through in the past year because of it is scary i do not want to somehow open up a wound that i will not be able to recover from although i see myself a a relatively strong and reliant person    i believe that nothing happened to me there is more chance that my sister is reinventing the past and her mind is playing trick on her due to her severe state she is also drugged most of the time but still the thing i read bothered me also i clearly can never let her know i found out about this it is a violation of her privacy even if it wa by mistake and can really affect her mental state this is also her secret and she would not want to know that i know about it especially since we are not in touch    what would you do in such a situation is it a good idea to poke into it or should i just try to move on with my life how can i even try to get to the truth if i wanted to the immediate advice would probably be to just let this go but try to be in my shoe and think if you would not want to know if something like this happened to you    thanks in advance,anxiety

1574,ive just had something really hard come up with my ptsd friend everything is ok now but for the future i want to have a better idea of where i stand on liability based on the action or inaction i take my friend ha been suicidal a few time before in the past during our friendship the first time i called for a welfare check because i didnt know if he wa alive or dead it wa awful after much talking and reading about this i did end up promising him that i would never do that again i know it controversial but with some people it can escalate and make thing worse im not here to discus that issue i try and be there for him and listen and encourage him to call a suicide hotline or get professional inpatient help but i think he just so afraid the police will show up and take him away involuntarily it a huge trigger for him one thing to mention we mostly talk via text because i have a disability and it isnt always easy for u to get together we do hang out in person on occasion but i cannot get to him in an emergency if i needed to because i cant get up his step we have a mutual friend that life a few house down from him who know of his issue is very calm and patient with him and can get to him in a hurry if needed sometimes he responds well to me just being there on the other end of the phone and just listening while other time he like a wild animal in a snare he cry out for help but is ready to bite the hand that try to free him that wa what happened recently so i called that mutual friend i had a text on my phone that read i am the most suicidal right now that ive ever been he want to be able to tell me that and expect that ill do nothing anything other than that to him is me gossiping there is just no way i can sit by and do nothing he ha attempted before and almost died so i take his threat seriously he can be angry at me and hate me all he want but i still feel like i did the right thing by confiding in his friend it brought up an interesting question however i had our conversation on my phone what would happen if he did follow through with suicide and it wa discovered that i didnt do anything i dont think he understands the obligation i am under i mean im sure id blame myself for my inaction but could i be in trouble myself im just curious im sure in the event of that the police would go through his phone for now im glad he ok his friend got him to an inpatient facility and he went willingly  hopefully he is getting the help he need my main concern right now is for him and thankfully this didnt end badly but i also need to know how this could impact me beyond just the guilt i would feel if this ever arises again and go badly thought,anxiety

1587,i am in college and i am wondering how to go about trying to get a diagnosis or at least documentation so i can get a single room i have a single right now but thats technically because i just dont have a roomate lol i strongly suspect i have cptsd i have sexual trauma when i wa a kid from the age of about   every weekend and even some weeknight and usually multiple time i had to overhear my mom and her bf having loud sex i know that this would not be traumatic for some but everyones nervous system is different and i had no escape from it cptsd is caused by inter personal trauma and i definitely think this count a that i already had several traumatic thing happen in my early childhood so this wa just adding to that my mom did not care at the timei think she truly felt entitled since it wa her house etc whatever but it doe not change the fact that i wa a child who wa indirectly involvedit felt extremely violating it made it worse to know that she knew and did not care i used to have extreme startle response and even auditory halluncinations along w other symptom which still occur fast forward to college my freshman year roomate wa awful always having her bf over and i used to sleep in the lounge just bc i knew that wa safe also awkard to be in the same room a people who are fucking obviously i think this experience brought back alot of the feeling i had been trying to suppress for yearsmy roomate left school eventually so i had a single the next year my roomate wa great and no issue but i still felt on edge and never  able to relaxalso my mom ha started dating a new guy and they have ton of pda all the time even though i have said that kg make me uncomfy like hand all over each other and making out the sound of making out is a huge trigger for me i think i might have misophonia he also sleep over a ton so i dread going home for break i have not a ton of friend still living in my hometown so i really have no where to go so home feel unsafe again i do not want to give up my peace of having no roomate but i have no idea how to get a single room is it hard ro get a ptsd diagnosis i think thats the only way i wont feel awful the rest of the year school need to feel safe since home doesnt,anxiety

1597,so im seeing a new psychiatrist and ive honestly been kind of skeptical since seeing him but today set off a lot of red flag before i wa on buspar for anxiety lamictal for depression and hydroxyzine a needed for panic attack and nightmare these were all put together a couple year ago after trying a lot of other med for my depression and anxiety that didnt work these didnt work that well either but better than anything else after figuring out i have ptsd it made a lot of sense that not a lot of med worked i specifically asked this new doctor if we could wean me off of my other med and then try to find something better suited for ptsd and my symptom caused by it my main symptom are nightmare and issue sleeping hypervigilance flashback and dissociation these have all been really severe these past couple month a well we started this process by me starting prazosin for my nightmare and other sleep issue already i wa a little nervous about this my blood pressure normally sits around  so the thought of starting a med that lower blood pressure and could possibly make me hypotensive really worried me he assured me that thing would be okay so i started prazosin i will say my nightmare have decreased dramatically i only have them once or twice a week at most since starting ive also been able to fall asleep better and stay asleep the only issue are i have to wake up at  every day for school and i feel so groggy and tired when i do that and when i went to the doctor recently my blood pressure wa  which is right on the line of hypotension then we also started me on strattera for my adhd i havent noticed much change yet but it take a bit to work then we started weaning me off of my buspar i havent had a lot of crazy withdrawal but i have been more energetic and more anxious and my heart rate ha been a lot faster since we agreed on starting me on something else to replace the lamictal and buspar i decided to research good medication for ptsd i realize thats not my job but im gonna be honest this doctor is late to every appointment and then we spend about an hour discussing medication option half of that is him googling stuff so i really wanted this session to be shorter and more to the point so i figured id get a head start i ended up finding some study and a lot of good review that suggested seroquel is good for ptsdso today i brought up seroquel explained that it would seem to treat my symptom and i could theoretically just take that and strattera instead of a bunch of other med he immediately turned this down and his main reason seemed to be that a big side effect of seroquel is weight gain and slower metabolism not something i really care about or medically need to care about at this point i then asked him if he had any other idea for med to replace the buspar and lamictal at least and he said that that wa what the prazosin wa for now im just really confused we had agreed on finding something to replace the buspar and lamictal after i started the prazosin and again my blood pressure is starting to worry me and prazosin doesnt really treat any of my other symptom theyve been about the same doe anyone have any experience taking just prazosin  and in reading this doe anyone else agree that this guy ha some red flag and i should maybe find a new doctor or am i overreacting ,anxiety

1622,i dont know how to advocate for myself and get the right care  here are the thing i know     i have depression and probably a mild form of anxiety  i have been treated for depression in the past although i felt le depressed during treatment these med didnt fix all of my issue  i have a complete inability to focus and rarely see project to fruition because once that project is out of my sphere of influence it cease to exist  yes this ha affected my career my hearing is absolute shit  but according to the audiology folk my physical hearing is fine so maybe it a focus problem  im missing memory if i set something down or if someone asks me remember something there is a good possibility it gone forever   that is clearly a shortterm memory problem but when i wa tested for memory issue via the anam test they said i wa in the normal range  i am also missing memory from time that other people clearly remember and that i should remember but dont   my colleague think i have a bad case of adhd since i am often unreliable a serial procrastinator and borderline lazy at time  this is not intentional i am super type a and i hate to fail i suck at remembering to take my med and i have almost zero motivation to make necessary medical appointment and keep them  i continuously let my prescription lapse because i forget to refill them and give up trying when i realize how long i havent been taking them      these issue did not exist prior to my combat tour to afghanistan and iraq  going to iraq after afghanistan wa actually a relief and i wa le stressed when i wa back in combat  however i spent the whole tour washing my sheet because i kept pissing the bed in my sleep with no memory of dreaming  this is soooo embarrassing for me to admit and i have never told anyonewatching u pull out of afghanistan wa like getting stabbed in the heart  my experience in combat are a defining portion of my life and are at time all consuming despite being more than a decade ago  i both love and hate my experience i both miss them and would never want to do them again  which really doesnt make any sense  they are the highest and lowest best and worst and most significant part of my life even though i have been married and have two amazing kid whom i love with every fiber of my being   try explaining to your friend and family that you enjoy combat it doesnt go well  im afraid to ask if i have ptsd because my experience arent nearly a bad a other people that i have known and served with  i have been lucky i still have my life and limb i am afraid that if i ask i will be told i am making it up that i am a benefit chaser and that ive exaggerated everything in my brain  i cannot handle balloon firework are okay but not balloon  fuck off with your balloon  i have been exposed to a lot of blast wave a lot  i have also seen more torn up body than i ever want to see again  noise in my own house doesnt bother me but loud ambient noise such a noise from many people talking make my heart pound sometimes because i cant hear or focus i dont want to admit i have any problem because it give men in my career field ammunition and supporting argument that woman shouldnt be in combat job  my problem are not that bad and i have a good life so why complain i am a badass bitch  i can handle anything rightso why am i here complaining to internet stranger a week ago i wokeup screaming with more fear than i have ever had in my entire life and i nearly gave my husband and dog a heart attack  i dont remember the dream or if there even wa one  it took me two hour to bring my heart rate down enough to sleep   my husband is leaving on deployment and my stress level is amplified and i feel like a wire pulled to tight  i am just waiting for my inevitable failure on some front that i am responsible for i have an appointment with military mental health in two day  in the past they have labeled me a having depression and anxiety   but i dont think it the root of the problem i dont really know what is and i dont know what to say to these people because i seem incapable of telling the truth or knowing what the truth is regarding my own feeling and thing i have experienced because when i try i feel like a walking cliche out of a bad bmovie how do i avoid looking like i am chasing benefit  how do i make them understand that my general depression is a symptom not the root and that i am not just some emotional female   i am so worn out and i feel like i need someone else to run my life  i could really use your suggestion on how to handle getting the care i probably maybe need,anxiety

1625,sorry for the rant but i wa wondering what you guy think about thisso basically i have lot of unhealed trauma starting from early childhood and the past three year with my abusive ex boyfriend destroyed me in more way that i could imagine he depleted my bank account abused me sexually and destroyed my mental healthwhat i see on here a lot is this type of advice that people give just get a glow up girl youll look better and feel better invest more in skincare and new clothes go on date etci am not saying that these thing do not help with improving one self esteem but they are the wrong type of advice a if i or many others had something to improve a if our emotional turmoil resulting from abuse would be solved by spending  at sephora or signing up for dumb yoga classesi wa buying nice clothes and hitting the gym three time a week before i met him and also during the relationship it didnt change anythingi think it somehow shallow to tell this people who recover from those type of relationship or any trauma because it give them the impression that improving one look will improve one self confidencethats not true  of the time what do you think,anxiety

1659,i think youve probably seen my previous post if youre familiar please skip to the bottom where i have a few question ive been ruminating about like crazy but a summary wife who ive been with  year with a  year old child suddenly discarded me blamed leaving on an argument found proof on her account to indicate this wa planned at least a week or more in advance the argument wa the excuse monkeybranched like crazy for two month strung me along had it in her to borrow money for our son and for bill to cheat and fly out of state currently ha multiple boyfriend i suspect shes cheated various time with  people since july called me a narcissist herself an empath no explanation after just pure ghosted me willing to throw away entire marriage for twin flame or a i call him twin shame no attempt to reconcile to talk about the relationship in  month nothing what pissed me off even further about this is  day after she returned the dude posted an image cartoon of a guy getting head by a naked woman whilst pointing a gun at a silohuette of a guy in a suit metaphor for a nice guy with rose metaphor for trying to win her back being shot in the face a if to say he wa trying to win her back whilst shes doing that activity and not giving a damn this is very coincidental if it is a coincidence because i wa really trying to win my wife back and now this make me wonder if she told the moron about me and he decided to post this or if it just a stupid post that randomly wa posted around that time but i know she know that i would check her social medium and try to figure stuff out so i cant help but think it wa deliberate which piss me the hell off i hope the twin shame go to the lowest pit of hell pop up via email when needing money usually it for our son then disappears and talk shit again said she need her freedom implying she had none and wasnt happy with me our  vacation prior said otherwise listened to mom to dump me my mil came outside once and said various time how her daughter wa gonna divorce me my wife stood behind her like a  year old and said nothing for  minute other than finally saying yeah im gonna file a restraining order if you dont leave this wa after she asked me to go by to drop off her clothes and a day before she flew out of state to cheat this wa two day after she borrowed money for our son school but i verified that it wa a complete lie she wanted that for pocket money also had my son call me for the first time in month and let u speak for  minute it wa to get me to buzz off for a few day so i wouldnt suspect what she wa doing she is an absolute abuse victim online liked page on energy vagina and penis energy vibration crystal witch stone tarot card spread twin flame separation astrology horoscope stuff and some other nonsense that i cant even remember showed up to the first court hearing and acted distant waved walked over said hi said she wa willing to let me have my son once a month laugh then begin to talk about everything else seemed flirty smiling and told me i look happy is too giggly googleyeyed and happy looking even looked away various time and held her breath almost a if she wa smiling but going to bust out with a chuckle said her dad support her from heaven asked me about my ex girlfriend i havent heard of in ten year denied flying out of state although i have  proof my sister in law of all people accompanied her to cheat knowing shes married to me later call me and talk about my friend her friend if i visited my dad grave her job she quit another job she want some stuff she left at our house etc seemed really friendly and flirty denied having any boyfriend and having a phone laughed when i said she get guy by trapping them then eventually dumping them out of nowhere i proceed to send an email to her saying dont contact me via email or her mom phone anymore cause i wa blocking them both she ha pretended she doesnt have a new phone since august and a new number she only would text rarely for money or needing something through her mom number and avoided any discussion about the relationship since she left she responded to my email which i had told her i wa going to block by saying i want to be happy leave me alone freedom is all i care about i literally just told her to stop contacting me and our marriage wa over everybody shes ever ranted about shes suddenly friend with now she hated on her family and her friend and now suddenly shes partying hanging out going out and speaking highly of all of them but she flipped on me and acted to them like i made her not see or hang out with them all of these year because im controlling always wa put down and controlled by her mother in extreme way told what to do kicked out and wa the scapegoat the younger sister is the golden child now my wife after year of hating on them and saying she wa an outcast ha suddenly left with them gone out partying and clubbing and drinking and smoking and doing all the thing she used to complain about and started saying that i controlled her and kept her away from her family i think shes trying to fight for her mom approval by acting like her younger sister but her mother is never happy i kid you not her mother get a check from the brother whose in the military the sister who work a regular clerk job and now want my wife food stamp and encouraged her to divorce me under the guise of me being a manipulator all for my child support my mil literally want my child support thats what this is all about and since she ha so much mental control over my wife she convinced her to do so by complaining about me to her privately via the phone over the span of weeksmonths my mil is even trying to inherit her deceased ex boyfriend house shes  and ha never worked since she wa last fired at the age of  and ha random guy go to the house and do thing for her the sister my wife and the mother all have public social medium account and ive even found them buying like my wife suddenly is trying to post a bad girl image of motorcycle thick woman bos babe alcohol party life like a try hard thats when shes not posting about needing to find a person to lift her up and that shes gonna make it or ha been put down but is rising up left me after my dad passed awaymy question is in their mind do they even feel shame or guilt are they capable of feeling shame guilt or anything else or do they literally not care whatsoever about their action and the impact it ha doe she not see that our child is affected by this doe she not think alienating my son from me all these month and preventing him from calling me is pure evil also her and her mother hanging up on him a he attempted to previously call me is not pure evil imagine this i once had to call the cop over there for a wellness check a my mil wa screaming at him since he called me and attempted to take the phone out of his hand back then my wife asked her why she wa doing that before a month later she actually started doing the same thing herself the cop go they act normal the cop call me and obviously wa extremely manipulated by them and told me he think my son ha anger issue and will eventually end up in jail i kid you not he the most well mannered and behaved kid ever and ha done excellent at school and never had behavior issue whatsoever yet they managed to even deceive a cop about thisquestions are they capable of shame or guilt for all of the craziness they cause to happen will she eventually try to hoover me or get back together do they love you even a little bit she asked me if i cook for myself and if i saw my dad grave why is her family dynamic so crazy why would my sil accompany her a she go out to another state to cheat on me why would her mother convince her to divorce me for child support by convincing her im horrible why is she so insistent on gaining approval of her mother when her mother only approves of her sister lifestyle which is to party and act reckless which my wife is currently trying to replicate is it normal to feel crazy i havent been normal since she left i ruminate about this all day got so depressed i couldnt even eatsleepwork and even lost my job ive essentially lost my mind and have become nonfunctional youve probably even seen me post about this a lot on here trying to find answer,anxiety

1662,i wa recently in a long term relationship and we were looking to the future and we were very much in love only a month before the end i received moving letter by email saying all the way i wa loved and why after we had an argument there wa an issue where my partner shut down over what seemed trivial thing i have anxiety and cared so much and pursued hard a quick resolution this made thing worse  my partner had previously disclosed sexual and violent abuse in different part of young life but did not go into detail and i did not want to pry this wa many year ago and she considered to be self recovered from ptsd i under estimated how this would impact today we agreed  of the time we were great together but decided to go to counselling to find a way forward where our coping mechanism clashed we only attended one session before i inadvertently triggered a trauma reaction when we were both very stressed whilst travelling  i wa struggling to cope with the panic attack and we had word in a public place my voice wa raised a little but could be overheard and someone asked if she wa ok due to demeanour and partner claimed it wa just about me raising my voice saying i wa being abusive  it seems trigger is being watchedoverheard and a raised voice though not shouting i said really sorry sincerely i so much wa for not coping and even though for most couple this would have been resolved by a chat after calming down kissing and making up i still wish i could have kept calmer regardless my own anxiety and stress took over my partner showed no concern then or since for my anxietystress but self absorbed normally very caring however from this moment my partner refused to talk thing over wa extremely passive aggressive and ended the relationship by text i called around to calmly to try and salvage thing but she panicked in a bizarre way reacted like i wa attacking rang the police and told lie and said she didnt want to see me again and had since told her friend she ended a she is frightened of me this is all so surreal i am a gentle person who ha never or would ever hurt deliberately anyone never mind the one i love and wanted to be forever  i have no criminal record indeed am advanced security checked  working with child  it feel stigmatising and i cant cope with the one i love perceiving me like this during the incident i wa trying so hard to help u both but lost my cool slightly in one moment she did not turn up for the second session the counsellor told me from the first session together and from what i had honestly explained that i had inadvertently triggered a trauma reaction she wa feeling the pain of what happened in the past but projecting the blame onto me i wa told her disassociation and avoidance were extreme in the day after the incident until the end text i wa told specific trauma counselling is needed but she refuse to engage with me and is not formally aware i think hint from counsellor issue were much about partner past trauma at first session when asked if loud voice wa connected to past trauma mean my partner may be in denial and prefers to get by rather than rake up the past partner wa concerned both to be to blame beforehand im aware that even if she doe contact me andor that trauma counselling could take a long time i dont want to hate for the way she ha been so cruel and brutal with me i am struggling to come to term with thing and understand the mindset if i could i would do anything to recover the situation and support the one i love but thing look very bleak it ha made me ill from u being so much in love to suddenly feeling hated and lied about i cant get my head around it and an constantly ruminating trying to figure a way for u to end the animosity but partner wont have contact with me i love my partner and dont want to hate even though i hate how she ha passed the abuse forward life seems so cruel any insight much appreciated please try to be kind a im not in a good place thank you,anxiety

1664,tw mention of sexual abuse and mention of suicide hey everyone im a little nervous posting about this since ive never told anyone about it but basically i wa sexually abused once and then never again by a parent when i wa  and ever since that moment i have never been able to stop thinking about it im now  and it wasnt until last year when i finally came to term with it since acknowledging the abuse it made me able to control my outburst towards the parent and stopped me from being suicidal yet i hate how i still have to live with that reoccurring memory every day im so scared to try therapy because it so hard to face what happened to me on top of that i still live with my parent and if i fear that if i interact with the parent who abused me i feel like i will have trouble regulating my emotion againanyways it just suck that this parent filled in a role that wa much needed for me and then turned to do something like this and altered my entire perception of them that nobody in my family will ever understand  on one hand i want to tell them that i wa abused but that would literally ruin life and our financial stability it feel wrong that one piece of information can drastically ruin everything this situation ha now made me a very overprotective sibling  to end all of this i just want to reach into my brain and pick out the memory so i never have to remember it ever again i want therapy and know i need it but i just want someone to tell me if therapy help with stopping the intrusive memory or even with therapy ill still have the memory pop up for the rest of my life,anxiety

1690, sorry for my shitty writing level im not exactly smarthey guy im m and ive really been struggling mentally for the past few year ive never really figured out whats wrong with me i sort of started going crazy during covid i did half of th grade and all of th grade online because it wa how the school were doing it howevery my mom made me do online school last year when i wa supposed to be going back to in person the worst part about it is that she made u go to spain during that time but i wa still attending a school in america so the timezones had me doing school from  pm to am it sounded fun at first but it wa just a non stop loop of waking up at  pm doing school binging netflix until  am and never talking to anyone other than my mom cuz i had no friend i never went outside because i always had school i would feel drained on the weekend so i didnt go out either i ended up going a bit crazy ive never felt the same since thenin august we came back to the u and i expected it to all be better i finally started in person school halfway through september it wa great at the beginning i made so many friend and the school wa just an amazing place but i wasnt exactly doing good in school i always got a and b and wa all around a good student lmfaooo my absent dad j called to check on me and then start yelling at me about doing good in school anyways now im writing the rest of this after having a breakdown in school i realized that i jus couldnt focus the thing is ive always had teacher and friend ask me if i had adhd or something but my mom jus always said it fake and that the government just want to give everyone med i started failing the new school and everyday there wa non stop arguing with my mom i tried opening up to her about my problem and how im always stressed depressed and unable to focus she just say oh it puberty itll all go away soon it been like this for year man it wont fucking stop she is literally the most stubborn person ever anytime i try to tell her something she just come up with a shitty counter argument so that she could get her way when i wa younger i just let it happen cuz she would beat me if i didnt but a i got older i just realized how fucking unfair it wa so i started fighting back thats why we always argue and nothing change she caught me smoking a lot which also just made u argue and made everything worsei ended up running away after a month at the new school for  week i wa staying and my friend house i expected it all to get better because i wa finally away from my mom and at first it wa great but then again it all went to shit i still always had terrible anxiety i still couldnt focus on school and i still feel so unhappy on the inside after i ran away my mom called the cop about  week in at school my counselor and the vice principal got involved but the only guy actually helping me wa my councelor i started having talk with cps about the abuse there always been physical and sexual abuse but im not tryna get too into detail about it nothing really happened they were jus tryna get me back to my mom on halloween i wa still a runaway but i wa going out with all my friend and i decided to try acid for the first time it wa great but i wasnt really in a good mental space i took the tab but before it kicked in i made a tiktok saying that i wanted to end my life cuz i wa kinda feelin not too well anyways the first  hour of the acid high were so amazing but once i got to my friend house the place i wa staying and i wanted to go to sleep it wa terrible and i wa feeling so unhappy i started cry my as off and i ended up using an eyebrow razor on my wrist self harm not attempt and left  mark since halloween wa on a monday this year i had to go to school the next day off  hour of sleep i got to school late and i got called to the assistant principal office there were  detective there from the sherrifs office to interview me they asked me pretty much the same question a cps about the physical and sexual abuse they also talked to me about the tiktok i made and i jus said it wa a joke but then my oversized as hoodie had to expose me and the sleeve rolled up so you could see the cut on my wristthen i got sent to the mental hospital and spent a few day there it didnt really help they released me back into my mom custody i also had a therapist appointment scheduled for a few day after i got out the next day i begged my mom to let me go hang out with my friend and surprisingly she did maybe because i wa threatening to kill myself and i told her how nothing every made me happy anymore except temporarily while im with my friend and i got high again to help the pain my anxiety got worse the first time i wa high posthospital but it wasnt too bad after i got back home i had to transfer to a new school but that wa the last thing i needed because having my friend at school wa the only thing helping me outanyways a week after i got out the hospital i started at a new school again see this wa the local high school that  of my elementry and middle school friend go to first day i wa there i walk into the bathroom and i see a kid i knew from st grade and a few kid from middle school it wa nice i felt a bit of happiness inside for the first time in a looong as time they had a stiiizy in their hand so you know i had to ask to hit it a stizzy is pretty much just a weed vape i took a few huge hit and i wa trippin ball it wa fun at first but then i sat down in class and my emotional pain and anxiety got so fucking bad that i started physically feeling the pain everywhere i told my teacher i had to go to the nurse office because i wa sick and i actually do still have a cold since then i got sent home but i wa actually headed to the old school i attended to go visit my friend the entire hour long bus and walk there wa just pain i had a good time and i got picked up by mom then the next day i went to the same friend house because i fucked up my haircut and i asked him to buzz it for me i stayed sober that day so i had a pretty good painless time then the day after that i went again yesterday this time it wa my friend birthday so everyone wa smoking and i had to aswell i got so fucking high and i started feeling like i wa on fucking acid again it wa good at the beginning but then it got really bad i started throwing up in the bathroom and this is where the new memory thing happensi wa throwing up alone while high a shit and the sound of me vomiting wa making a song the entire time i wa throwing up wa a musical i wa beautiful but it wa about something that still give me goosebump while thinking about it i wa hearing shit too it wa like hallucinating but with my ear it wa my mother yelling at me and i dont remember about what it felt so real tho it wa like i remember it happening i dont exactly remember what wa happening but i remember how i wa feeling i could hear my mom yelling at me and little me saying i dont remember i wa still throwing up and everything wa harmonizing i mostly remember how sad and especially how fucking scared i wa i just remember how fucking scared i felt while there wa arguing and screaming in the backgroundnow the problem is i dont know wheather to trust this or not since yesterday ive been staying away from my mom because i feel scared whenever shes next to me it wa like that memory came to me and permanently scarred me i can still feel how scared i wa little me back in spain before we moved to america screaming and cry in fear because my mom wa yelling at me and i simply did not remember i believe she wa trying to get some information out of me or something like that ive always had shitty memory even before smoking and i think i might have memory problem it wa a if the entire event wa a memory thats been so far lost and i accidentally got it back ive heard that the brain can unconsciously forget an experience if the brain register overwhelming trauma it felt so fucking real ive had certain period in my life in which i dont remember anything there wa a full month of th grade that i still dont remember to this day but this one time i opened up my old instagram account and looked of countless hour of dm with people at my old middle school that i dont remember and the message were about me wanting to kill myself and me wanting to end itso im absolutely fucking sure that my brain hide thing from me sometimes and  believe that there wa a time were my mom beat me so hard i threw up and my brain just forgot about it and keep in mind that my fucking mother did this to me a a child because we

1712,im a junior at university and had a severe traumatic experience happen to me in the beginning of the semester where i almost died from nearly drowning my body wa fine but i had a fullblown near death experience and it wa the most frightening thing that ever happened to me i wa scared so badly from what happened that i really couldnt concentrate on academic during the semester because i wa constantly so freaked out about knowing what death will feel like and knowing and seeing that there nothing there because i felt it my partner wa there when it happened i wa actually only there because it wa something they wanted to go to and they didnt seem to understand how bad it wa for me i cant swim although i have tried to learn for many year a a child and i just wanted to be able to go and do this for them i really thought i wa going to die i knew i wa about to die because i wa going under the water it been month since then and im still alarmed every day and unable to stand almost anything or being around anyone it feel horrible and it seems like it must be really obvious to others that im doing poorly with this because family and friend keep telling me i should go and get therapy i dont know if they mean that or if theyre just tired of hearing about how upset i am after what happened i did a withdrawal from my class for the semester because that would be better than getting an f and a professor had told me to go to one of the care office to start the process of having it marked a being for medical reason the first person i talked to at the front desk asked me to describe what happened and i tried to stay calm when talking about it in general term but my body wa trembling and my breath wa catching and i wa struggling to talk about how it happened without cry it wa really embarrassing because i wa trying to explain the issue without a lot of unwanted emotion getting in the way but it got to the point where talking about how it happened wa causing me to start feeling and smelling the water going up into my nose again almost like i wa there i tried to tell them about what it wa like and they seemed concerned and called out someone from the back to talk to me and said they would stay with me and walk me to a counseling center i talked to the next person at the front desk at the counseling center they called someone about it for a bit then told me the next available appointment wa in  minute they didnt want me to come back in  minute they wanted me to stay in the waiting room literally until the next available appointment opened upabout  minute later a psychologist call me back to her office and it set up in a very calming way a soft loveseat a pretty lamp on an end table a bookshelf of psych textbook and a candle that smelled really nice for the second time i get into explaining exactly what happened how it happened why it wa so stressful why there are difficult thing about it that are making it really hard to move past it i start getting that unwanted emotional reaction while explaining it again even though i tell them this isnt something im wanting to experience and if anything it get in the way of me talking about it it just really physical i actually start sweating and my face feel so warm and it get hard to state my thought in a much of an organized way that wa the second time in le than an hour i wa having some actual flashback thing happen to my body from trauma i actually hadnt faced that headon before these were the first people id spoken to about this in person or in the context of seeking therapy or treatment it a really really awful feeling and both the front desk person at the care center and the psychologist seemed like they were really worried about what wa happening to me and wanted to help me urgently that wasnt something i expected because im honestly just not used to people caring about me being in any kind of distress or considering that to be important or urgent or something they feel motivated to do something about unfortunately once i get to the point of explaining when this had happened and when i withdrew for the semester the psychologist tell me im not considered a student anymore so im not eligible to receive any session with their counseling center or even this initial consultation they give me a printout of community provider i dont have insurance and then they seem to remember to do their risk assessment where they ask if ive been having any thought of harming myself or others no and then they literally send me out some side door in the back of the building i didnt even know wa there so i thought they considered this important but it turn out two of their people before the psychologist had just been completely wrong about whether i could still receive service for having this marked a a medical withdrawal and once the psychologist basically decided i wasnt supposed to be there it wa like a switch flipped and they couldnt get me out of there fast enough i dont usually go to therapy the last time wa in  and that wa one session to get a letter clearing me for something from another provider and before that about four or five time being dragged against my will to various counselor and psychologist a a teenager because i wa depressed but at this point how exactly am i supposed to approach this go back there at the start of next semester i enrolled for my class immediately after getting yeeted out of the psychologist office because wow fuck you then and walk into the same office full of the same people who can just turn on a dime and decide whatever they thought wa so concerning actually doesnt matter go down a list of other therapist and just have one opportunity after the other to find out when theyll decide im not supposed to be there and they werent supposed to care about me in the first place this ha all been an immensely jarring and isolating experience of honestly feeling like the people around me dont particularly care if i live or die these two people were the first and only one to give me the impression that human being actually worried about how obviously notokay i am after this and then the third person decides that actually there been an error and it wa a mistake for them to care doe anyone around me even understand how this is at a minimum unhelpful and at worst actually causing more damage this is completely frustrating and i have no idea what to do from here,anxiety

time waiting to die pretend to be somewhere else forget stop  born to live and to love raised in a world and living in a place where i am not allowed to love or show emotion it would only cost me you miserable sack of shit wanted to use something a an excuse you had better take care of yourself so you dont cause anyone any problem you piece of trash keep cry noone care stop bringing people down with you it will all end this is the only time they will be seen or heard or felt thing i should remember  my parent used to yell a lot i could hear it through the wall and i would think that they were yelling about me i can hear people talking about me even when there noone in the house they are usually talking about how awful or weird or whatever other adjective i know and am it not even bad all the time just most of the time it really bad paranoia i figure i have very poor self esteem and a very negative outlook on life i try to not let this show because i dont want to make others feel like i do with this in mind and the fact that im paranoid enough to think people outright dislike me i worry that people think im crazy or will and this had led to many panic attack the existential dread trigger them a well i worry about going outside my room or home i worry about every word i say and action i take i even make sure to avert my eye from anything that would warrant attention the job ive worked recently have only solidified my paranoia and low self esteem there noone that i can connect with or relate too oftentimes i figured any people that i would connect with wouldve killed themselves i keep quiet and to myself while attempting to work a efficiently a possible i get nervous when people talk to me not only because i might hear them say something they didnt or would never say but also because im worried about what they think about me my bos a customer a coworker a friend my family none are excluded and i know that any one person with enough determination could ruin my life in whatever way they see fit this being said im very prone to nervous shaking that usually lead to panic attack and ever increasing self awareness i dont want to have panic attack while driving but i also had the option to deliver i hope it will work since it one of my only option now im worried about driving for many reason i wa in a car accident i caused in the recent winter and now every car i pas on the road i see crash into me in my mind every roadside littered with fresh graf during the car accident i believed i couldve died and accepted it regardless at the moment i am unable to pay rent let alone search for medical help i need ive received cheap and free help before and it did a great job making me feel like just another number in the machine i dont search for help often a i prefer to hide and waste away the only reason im reaching out now is im becoming a problem to the others around me and i resent myself i know if i receive disability got denied like i applied for many people will hate me including many of my family but ive stopped seeing them anyway and i avoid meeting with most people ive lost my last two job because of all this at walmart i wa hired on a a warehouse worker but since i mostly kept to myself they let me go with seasonal employee they said i wasnt outright fired so i could reapply in the future but that i had some obvious problem i needed to sort out first at best buy i wa able to work inventory for a few quiet month but my paranoia had me convinced everyone hated me so i quit abruptly and without any real reason i know there no way they would rehire me after disappearing i have to talk to you a if you didnt already know what i wa going to say wait you didnt know we all die for nothing and everything end without anything or anyone knowing about any of it u or how we felt it like i have to prove im sad without assuming you already know why i would be like common sense actually existed and wasnt a construct of my perception and upbringing this affect my life  panic attack anxiety paranoia religion realism the worldenvironment voice in my head self esteem both my parent were raped when they were child i wa constantly watched and disciplined by them growing up the car accident i cant afford to help anyone i cant trust help from anyone i wont look for help i have nothing to live for people close to me get depressed and kill themselves other people in my family were abused by their parent i lose my job noone will be remembered i am a bother to everyone i dont leave my room i avoid even my friend im crazy im worried about being locked up waste what a feeling i grew up believing that someone or something  and through said thing  potentially everyone else knew or would know everything id experienced that they would know who i wa and still be more than me maybe they would be different or maybe they would be a lot like me maybe they would hate me  for who i wa thought said and did maybe they would understand relate or sympathize maybe someone else knew me but then i ended up believing  that if i want just trying to make myself feel better or i wasnt just pretending then i wa just alone and noone would ever remember or know me or how i felt or what i thought about my life became pointless there will be noone waiting for me in the end nothing i hear voice people that arent therehate me see me i have panic attack they happen more often around people im afraid of people they are all capable of anything i expect people to hate me because i hate myself i dont like to talk it easy to make mistake there no good reason to continue living no matter what ill die and my body will only get worse a i continue living living isnt a good experience already anyway and noone will remember any of it or u or how we felt or what we did i try to avoid people and not bother them with how i feel i still think about killing myself every day eventually noone will want me around and i wont have to worry about leaving or hurting anyone by killing myself im just alone i had another panic attack last night i laid in my bed for hour shaking i kept saying im going to wake up tomorrow i kept saying im alive i have painkiller if you need some just ask why did she say that shes calling your bluff shes saying use them to kill yourself already i just said thank you,anxiety

1732,i have never really had any friend in real life and ive always struggled with social anxiety a well a low confidence because i grew up in an abusive home the few friend i did have usually mistreated me in some way for being unpopular or we just naturally drifted this led me to being an outcast and finding very toxic misogynistic online space where i naively believed people would be understanding because they were space for other outcast i stuck around because i found the meme funny it wa interesting i didnt know that guy struggled with loneliness and insecurity about appearance like i didgetting to the point i found one interactive space linked to such community where there wa a group of people who were nice to me at first called me funny and smart for the first few month i ended up talking to a guy and we got into a toxic friendship thing because id call him up on sexualising underage girl and hed tell me it a joke and that i dont understand humour but then hed keep making the same post and they were serious sometimes hed admit that he preferred underage girl then when id say he liked them hed say im accusing him of committing a crime and would say he doesnt like me viewing him in a bad light he ended up dating an underage girl a year later too when he would tell me that hed never date an underage girl he would also encourage me to act overly attached to him for ex i made account to contact him when hed block me during argument which  i know is wrong i regret it and will never do something like that again and id beg for him not to cut contact with me and then the next day id ask if he want me to stop being so clingy if he find me creepy and hed say no he liked what i did and found it sweet and that it showed i genuinely did like him this happened multiple time we then stopped talking and he told the group everything that had happened but instead spun it into me being obsessive and him having never liked me even though we spoke regularly he told me he spoke to other girl but i wa the only close female friend he had he tried to meet with me many time and id be the one putting it off he the one who introduced the idea of u having sex he told me he wanted to meet even if i didnt want to have sex i wa sexually obsessed with him and he rejected it he the one whod initiate all conversation about sex he showed them all screenshots of the account i made he told them detail about my personal life and trauma and laughed about it to them too he also reached out to me month later apologised for everything and said he wanted to be friend but hed continue to lie to me when id ask if hed been talking about me he had negatively and why he doe or say certain thing so he just called me crazy for noticing his lie the group bullied me theyd all constantly be talking about me in voice recording and group chat other people told me about this theyd spam picture of me they kept calling me insane when id respond i would just keep repeating the same argument that they didnt know anything about me and were targeting me for no reason they would even start talking about me to new member who joined the group and those people would hate me and start attacking me too theyd also claim that i take thing too seriously and that it a joke but they were needlessly and relentlessly bullying me when i hadnt done anything to them i can see the difference between a joke and evil behaviour they also would save and post girl nude post people picture without permission ob over underage girl theyd done this from the start yet theyd say they only did it a a joke because i would call them out on it and they wanted to annoy me when in reality these men genuinely did find underage girl attractive and had been saying so before id ever even spoke out against it dox people theyd target other member of the group too but not a severely a they did to me they would call me paranoid because id tell them to stop talking about me theyd claim they werent even though other people showed me evidence they were theyd call me obsessive yes i wa obsessed with the guy but i wa not obsessed with any of them a individual id only interact with them if they started on me for no reason i know that these people are just loser but it still get to me that theyd believe the lie from that guy and that theyd call me insane when theyd do a lot worse thing than me and all i did wa get upset and defend myself when i wa being attacked i never did any of the weird thing they did i simply tried to use logical argument against them there are even people who werent directly in the group who had originally liked me who started insinuating i wa some crazy ugly freak when again i hadnt done anything not everyone thought this way though i did have a handful of people tell me that they targeted me for no reason and i wasnt the problem and they were weirdo i also went to a few other community where people had interacted with these same people and they called them insufferable too id only stay in the community and keep going back because i wanted to defend myself and i thought eventually theyd see how weird they were being and because originally i just liked posting my own content there because i wa viewed a funnyit just make me cringe that i even care about this stuff and i want my brain to turn it off but i cant i just keep going over it all in my head thinking about specific argument and how i wasnt even wrong at all there wa even one occasion where a girl had targeted me for giving her advice and then month later said that i wa right and there wa nothing i couldve said differently how it unfair and weird that i wa treated insane when i just hadnt done much and there were other girl in that same community who were extremely malicious and cruel for no reason i also hate that the guy lied about me and would act like i wa the problem he also spread lie about me saying im a derogatory term for promiscuous woman and i just want to be used by a random guy for sex im an adult virgin that my family are poor my dad make over k a year im from a different county that i claim to be because hed met one other girl from the same county who had a different accent all the people there were extremely deranged yet they viewed themselves a normal and called me deranged it wa weird tldr i wa unfairly targeted by a group of people online because i made a mistake and i always took the bait my brain is now obsessed with it i left the group month ago but sometimes i cant pursue my interest or hobby because i think about everything that happened,anxiety

im in school i let this person know he offered to hug me and hold my hand i told him i dont feel comfortable with holding hand he still sent me a picture of his hand anyway and then  day after i didnt respond because i wa sick with covid he got offended and wrote i guess this is it  to  day within my last shortmessage checking on you i have not gotten any response on top of that  day since i wrote the message with the photo id go straight to the point part of me feel more worried that something might have happened to you but a big part of it also felt im ignored i know and understand you may be busy between taking care of mom and school or finding a job but it not thar hard to saywrite a thought or a simple response to make a friend feel at ease also your silence most likely mean you have issue with me sending that picture i am sorry to be honest i have the purest of intention i dont need to explain myself over and over i initially thought youd be happy or at least feel comfort reading thar message how would you feel if you send someone a photo and youbget no response i know it not a important a sending the photo of someone face but still it personal for me this is honestly the first time after  month i felt something wrong about this friemdship i dont want to be attached to this any longer it sounding like my online friendship recently and the others in the past i should just probably be thankful this did not drag on for long le time to be attached le hurt i guess i value friendship or anykind of relationship differently than most people i male them feel uncomfortablethank you best wish for you and mom and take care i told him i didnt feel comfortable with holding his hand and not sure why he sent the picture of his hand to me and that i wa sick with covid forget about that he didnt care about that he cared more that i wa ignoring him than my mother or me being sickhe got very very very nasty with me and thought i insulted him when i told him i wa not comfortable with holding his hand and why he sent a picture he sent me statement such a no wonder people do not like you you are weird dont flatter yourself why i would like you keep dreaming i had many relationship and you never had one maybe because guy dont like you psychically even your friend wanted to change how you looked and wa indecisiveness about your look lol he brought up my crush and how they never took a second look at me or even talked to me and how they were just nice to me because it wa their job it seems he took pleasure in trying to humiliate me in the sensitive thing i opened up to him abouti told him about my grief about an online friend who died from alcoholism in the past and he wa messed up to actually bring it up and write please just shut up whenever you say i could relate about grief or anything of that kind you will never understand that because you have never really been in that situation and perhaps will never be losing a partner that youve been living with for long year and you compared to an online guy friend with all due respect to him it not the same feeling not even close also with the way you lashed out at me and treated me after do you think id still believe that you felt sad when he left thats funnyhis last statement to me wa  you are  and never had a true friend or a proper relationship  lol dont worry this is the last time you will hear from me i just wont let your personal insult slide good luck finding someone who will accept youhe also told me how his ex gf wa beautiful and that comparing you to her would be an insult to her i can show you a picture of her he ha never ever seen a picture of me ever and randomly bring this up to boost up his ego he triggered me so much his ex gf hated him by the way and made sure to separate her daughter from him when she died to live with her family his daughter doe not like him either and hei never had anyone say so much abuse in a span of paragraph it triggered me and made me suicidal and confirming my thought of all my abuser in the past maybe im really ugly and thats why no one like me and i will never have a relationship like he said because im too ugly and weird a he put it and he keep denying that he is talking about me and how the world doe not revolve around me and tell me how i never talked about the good people in my life and basically said im a loser that no one like with no friend or bf and how i kept venting and venting even though he reached out to me to talk and he vented so much about his ex gf who died in a very bad wayto me his daughter his other friend who broke it off with him because he wa creeping her out a well and said disgusting thing to her a well and she is younger than mei still feel so hurt and shocked over what he told me and it triggered lot of bad feeling within myself i reported him to the mod on the forum but they just gave him a warning and didnt ban him so he is still on there so i dont go on there a much anymore but still feeling angry and shaken up over it i warned a lot of people especially on woman on the forum about that narcissist predator it seems he ha a new victim now saying the same thing to her i also found out he had a relationship with a  year old girl when he wa  how disgustingexcuse the length i didnt realize it ended up this long,anxiety

1740,so first of all im not a native speaker so there may be some mistakesampxbi f have been diagnosed with ptsd on  and i had been trying my best to cope with it long story short i wa in an abusive relationship in my teenage year around  and shortly after it ended i wa abused and almost raped by a classmate december of  after all those event i really didnt know what to do with myself i felt nasty a if it wa my fault the first month of  went by and i didnt leave my house i wa sad and anxious afraid to even speak to people the only coping mechanism that i found during that time wa eating a lot or not eating at all so that generated a lot of insecurity and low selfesteem due to my constant weight fluctuation later that year i started college and dropped out idk it wa like everything scared me i didnt want to go out i wa too afraid by that time i wa underage so i couldnt seek professional advice because my father wa against itone important detail is that when i wa almost raped my father forced me to file a police report i didnt want to since i wa still processing everything and i wa in shock i dont want to go in detail but all of this happened during a school trip shortly after it happened i went out on my own in a town i didnt know and started walking until i found a government stablishment that specializes in this kind of stuff also i didnt have phone signal to comunicate with my parent i remembered that place from one of the little walk we took into the town the day before when i arrived i told a counselor everything with detail they took me to the hospital and i wa examined by a doctor who said that i wa still in shock so he gave me some med to calm me down after that we went to an office which had a room with a bed and some other stuff i had to wait there until they call my parent and come pick me up i slept for hour due to the med and when my parent arrived thats when my father took me to the police station and forced me to file the reportafter that there wa a long process ahead twice or thrice a month i had to go to the jury or the police station to state what happened so that made me relive the situation many time the first time i remember cry a lot but after that i became more and more numb to it then the pandemic came and for me it wa such a relief the judicial process stopped i wa doing some freelance job from home so i had no excuse to leave my house eventually i turned  and i knew i needed help so i started seeking therapy i lived in a small city so there wasnt many therapist available it took me  month to finally find one and with me being now an adult i could cease the investigation and process that wa being heldso in  i started going to therapy  month in my therapist suggests i go with a psychiatrist and shortly after the diagnosis is ready ptsd generalized anxiety and insomnia i start taking med even though my father wa against it but i wa making huge progress then  wa coming to an end and it wa time for me to move because i decided to start college again moving came with changing my therapist but my father wa upset because i didnt talk to him about my recovery weve always had kind of a harsh relationship it wa really hard for me to talk about such sensitive topic with him so he imposed that he wa only going to pay for my therapy if he got to choose which therapist i go to i agreed because i wouldnt be able to work while i wa studying i talked to my psychiatrist to tell him the decision i took so we started to reduce the dosis of the med until i could totally leave themi moved and i started going with this new therapist i told her my diagnosis and that i wanted to take med again because the symptom were too difficult to cope with she insisted in that i didnt need them and that first we had to try other thing like yoga meditating changing habit a if i didnt try doing all those thing on my own when i couldnt seek help to put it in a nutshell thing got worse all the progress that i made wa almost gonearound that time in college i meet my nowadays boyfriendm the time went by i got to know him and eventually fell in love with him a we started dating i told him of my mental health issue i told him my trigger about the abuse and my past relationship he wa comprehending and willing to help since we started dating we spent a lot of time together so i really trust him and feel a if i can talk about anything with himfast foward to yesterday i wa staying at his place i wake up in the morning sweating i dreamt of the abuse he notice that i wasnt feeling right and check up on me shortly after he leaf because he had a compromise with his nephew while he wa gone i took a shower and tried to cheer myself up when he arrived we spent some time joking around but he notice that i wasnt feeling so good so he asks me if i wanted to talk about what happened we did and i ended up telling him everything about the abuse thinking that it would make me feel better eventually i got to feel better so we decided to get up and play some videogames a we do he receives a call from one of his nephewsf she wa waiting for the bus and  guy on the other sidewalk were taking picture of her he drop everything put on a hoodie and go with her but when he arrived she had already taken the bus when he came home he wa sweating and i could notice that he wa kind of tense i ask him if everything wa okay he tell me that he feeling okthe day go by and my mood wa kind of fine but at night it got even worse i get an email with the grading for an exam and i didnt pas it wa my last chance to pas the course he make some silly joke to make me laugh and succeeds so we lay down on the couch and watch some tv after that he grab his computer and play some lol while i listen to music and play videogames on my phone nothing abnormal we get kinda sleepy so we go to bed and he try to make some move on me i tell him that i wasnt on the mood due to what happened in the morning he stop and we try to sleep but he kept tossing and turning he get up grab his phone and tell me ill be back soon i cant sleep and head into the bathroom since the wall in his place are pretty thin i could hear the pornhub intro and how he kinda panic and turn the volume downwhen he came back he asked me if everything wa okay the thing is im against porn it a simple a this it trigger me and make me feel insecure i tell him my point of view and he didnt understand what triggered me about it that it wa normal for men to watch porn that he wa masturbating because he wa feeling tense and that wa his coping mechanism and since i wasnt in the mood for having sex he didnt want to bother me i told him that what bothered me wasnt him masturbating it wa him watching porn he said that he would stop if i wanted to but that he didnt understand my point i kept telling him that im against it because it unrealistic it set unreal expectation it lowered my selfesteem and that i just couldnt bear imagining him jerking off to other woman he again said that he didnt want to bother me and i told him that i sent him lot of pic and video so he had something to jerk off to while i wasnt around we kept on fighting for the same thing for over an hour so he decided to go for a walk in the middle of the night while he wa out i got my stuff packed in my backpack and got an uber i left him a note but anyways he wa in the porch when i wa ready to leave he insisted on me staying i told him i needed to be alone i left and while i wa on road he called like  time to check up on mei just cant really get to a logical conclusion on why i get so disgusted by porn is not that i didnt try watching it before i did and it didnt change my feeling about it it just made me remind my past relationship and the abuse it just trigger me a lot and knowing that a person i love consumes it just tear me apartfast foward to today we both apologised and agreed to talk about it past tomorrow since i have an exam on that date i also seeked help again and found a new therapist so maybe ill start recovering again i know all of this wouldnt have happened if i wasnt triggered many time during that day,anxiety
1741,f senior in hsi have a film and literature class where we read book and watch the film inspired by the book sometimes we just watch film and write about themweve watched a ton so far and ive liked most of them however we started watching split  i knew the movie wa a bit disturbing so i went on doesthedogdiecom to see the content if any of the subject in the film would be triggering there implied csa a huge trigger of mine no matter how small the implication is i wa on edge but tried to push through from the beginning it got triggering i tried my best to just stay calm but it all hit me at once i broke down in front of everyone it wa embarrassing and the movie wa paused i felt like all eye were one me they kind of were it made me cry even more i felt humiliated i felt so vulnerable so scaredmy teacher spoke with me and allowed me to leave the room and go elsewhere and that helped a lot the damage ha already been donei feel selfish for it i feel like i killed the mood im genuinely ashamed it hurt so badly overtime ive become so much more sensitive to certain thing more sensitive than ive ever been and that make my daily life so hard idk how to even feel my head hurt im so upset with myself i try to cope with certain trigger but i can only get so far it just alot to process i feel like a drama queen party pooper,anxiety
1742,hey there ive been having extreme physical pain in changing area of the body for the last  month it some kind of muscle pain i feel like there no way to relax my body even if my mind feel relaxed or im trying to meditate kinda feel like even if my mind feel safe my body is always on alert ive been to all the doctor and had all kind of examination with no result i will go to a pain clinic soon to learn how to manage my pain i keep hearing from my doctor and physiotherapist that my body seems traumatized a it very sensitive to their touch im extremly jumpy and cant relax during the treatmenti had the first admission talk with the pain clinic doctor this week and he think that i have ptsd and that my physical pain is a physical consequence of ptsd now im kinda confused by his statement so i would like to ask the community here if maybe they also havehad physical pain a part of their symptom because my physical pain is so severe that i had to pause my study and stop working and i just cant yet believe that it not due to a physical problemand what im also wondering is if it really can be ptsd because ive lived a whole bunch of traumatic event in my childhood and teen year and find it hard to narrow down which event actually could have traumatised me in this strong waybut i also dont think ive ever really worked through my trauma im hiding a lot i guesskinda feel stupid to ask but i kinda always thought people with ptsd have like one extreme traumatic event and they know exactly what it is and have flashback etc are there also people out here than have the symptom but arent sure what caused iti have suffered from a lot of psychological issue the last few year and im also in therapy but i wa never diagnosed with ptsd by my therapist but we actually never really talked about my childhood most talk are based on recent struggle a year ago so before the pain started i started having depersonalisation and derealisation disorder after a very stressful time it wa really bad i sometimes wa in this condition for multiple day and week but i wa always conscious of whats happening no flashback no amnesia etc after i learned how to handle this and i got it somehow under control i started having severe trouble sleeping anxiety depression panik attack etc and got diagnosed with general anxietyi now wonder if this is all part of a bigger psychological issue and if it actually could be ptsd thanks for reading if you got this far i would really love to hear from your experience and maybe even find some answer for myself,anxiety

1776,people emotionally close off when i talk about my issuesfeelings i understand why this reaction is appropriate if someone traumadumps on a person that they dont know very well like when i took my son to the park and some stranger sat next to me and started telling me about an awful trauma out of nowhere that wa clearly inappropriate and made me extremely uncomfortable but i find that people who im close to react to me like im a strangerthis happened today with my boyfriend ive known him for  year and weve been datingliving together for the last  he woke me up from a weird nap i wa taking it lasted an hour and several time throughout it i woke up in panic mode and i wa very startled ive been very stressednot sleeping much for the past few week and every little thing sends me into a panic i told him that i didnt sleep last night that everything is making me panic and described the panicked feeling id had throughout the nap he looked annoyed and angry a i spoke so i asked him what wa wrong he said nothing we went back and forth about it until i said clearly something is wrong you look and sound angry and annoyed he said that hearing about this stuff is too much that it make him feel drainedhis face and what he said reminded me of the many time that people who claimed to love me reacted to me opening up and talking about a problem it baffle me they love me when i help them with their problem but when im going through something they put up a wall they only love me when it easy when im doing thing for them when im putting on a show pretending that im finei love this guy but sometimes i feel like he just not being fair or maybe this is just my trauma talking i give way too much of myself to people and then i feel like whatever i get back is inadequate maybe im the problem but i also dont want to go back to the version of myself that wa hiding all of the time just to make other people comfortablei feel like i cant really talk to anyone about my problem they cant handle it im in therapy now but i feel like she doesnt understand either shes getting paid to talk to me and seems just a frustrated a everyone elsei dont know what to do anymore i hate it when people say why didnt you tell me what you were going through and why didnt you talk to me whenever i break down and stop being functional because theyre the same people who put up wall when i open up now,anxiety
1777,hello so when i wa younger not exactly sure what age i wa diagnosed with ptsd but it ha never really effected me at least i dont think it ha whenever i think of ptsd i think of people who have trigger around certain thing and then have flashback i guess or there is certain thing they cant do i really dont know much about ptsd other then the fact that you get it because of a traumatic event i mean i have anxiety and depression which my depression doesnt really effect me at all but my anxiety cant get pretty bad at time i also have attachment disorder and i can understand that being an effect of ptsd but other then that nothing really major at least to me nothing major i guess what i am asking is why dont i remember anything wa it because i wa too young because i have also heard that ptsd is not always the case with memory loss and that it is also a normal part of just getting older and also i am in no way wishing i had worse trauma i am just curious a to why i cant remember it and why i have no trigger below ill say how i got my ptsd diagnosis trigger warning  i think not to sure how tws work so i am putting one just in caseso i wa born three month early i believe at around  week not to sure at the  of week and my birth mother wa only  or  when she had me so she had a struggle right from the beginning from what i wa told she wa a tripper and i wa well obviously and accident she wa doing drug during and after the pregnancy and she would give me drug also i dont know if sleeping medication is considered a drug what she would do is when she would go to work tripping she would drug me and lock me in a closet so i wouldnt go anywhere and i would sleep the whole time now i dont remember anything at all but i wa told she did this from age  or  she had help raising me while she had me from a foster family who i am very close to now a they helped me get to a family that ended up being my parent nowso she met the foster family through a church and they helped in raising me when my birth mother couldnt and they had ended up getting pretty close well from what i wa told one day the foster family wanted to go on vacation and the foster family had a family of there own with fully grown child who had there own kid a well i wa told that one of there grown child caught wind of my birth mother wanting to go on the family vacation with them and had told there parentsmy foster parent that if she and her kid went they would not go because she is a drug addict and they dont want her around there kid which to me make complete sense they were looking out for there own family so they came to the decision to not let her come when they told her she wa very hurt and i wa told she felt betrayed my foster parent so after they left to leave for the airport she broke into there home with me in her arm she started there house on fire apparently running through the fire with me in her arm hotwired there car and she headed off to the airport the neighbor called them telling them what she had witnessed and they ended up tracking her down trying to board a plane to head to mexico she told the police her plan wa to flee after starting the fire head to mexico and get plastic surgery on her and me i think i wa around ish at the time so after that she lost all right obviously for multiple reason but the main one being arson and i wa put into foster care then later adopted so after dumping my life story why dont i remember literally anything fire is not a trigger enclosed space or dark space arent a trigger i dont remember anything but wa diagnosed with ptsd whyampxbthanks for any response givenalso sorry if i used the tw wrong,anxiety

1780,when you are in a good space come up with three safe topic this could be your pet your favorite song or anything similar when your thought or a conversation are going place you think could become triggering switch to the safe topic this is easier said than done however it take away the dont think about pink elephant issue by having something else specific to think about you could also mention these topic to people who support you so if they notice you are uncomfortable or notice the conversation going somewhere you said is triggering they can switch it a well i also do this when one of my trigger song get stuck in my head just specifically thinking the lyric to a safe song you may need to switch up the topic every once in a while but i have found this very helpful,anxiety

1790,i am  and have yet to start college my parent were abusive in extreme way all my life and even though my olevels result came out good  purely because i lived at my neighbor house to study my alevels came out average with an a b and a d before i get into my current situation and emotional dilemma i need to clarify certain thing throughout my whole life i had to deal with severe bullying and harassment emotional sexual and physical from my school peer and family included ive never gotten to fall in love have a childhood or live like a teenager when i wa one it wa almost like the moment i turned  my childhood ended there is a lot of history behind it and i dont feel it is necessary to get into that even if it could shed light on my situation but yeah that wa my life everything i had wa my curse after i hit my teenage year i suppose a lot of boy around me started noticing i wa pretty that wa to become my curse the number of boy who crushed on me i dont know but i know the number of boy who psychologically and physically harassed me because i didnt submit sexually to graphically represent it a friend once threatened me that he will isolate me and prevent me from having friend if i didnt fuck him and truth be told he followed up with his promise because when i didnt he actually did isolate me the school did nothing on the matter i dont know why maybe it had something to do with powerful family member but in any case this wa just an example there were many others like him and each atrocity wa worse than the last my situation at home wa worse because i wa sexually molested by my uncle for month during the time and my father did nothing to prevent it despite seeing my uncle do it with his own eye and a for my parent they blamed me for the sexual abuse i got from others claiming i didnt know how to carry myself outside a a result all of this happened to me and that it wa my fault they used that given reasoning to isolate me from the world any extracurricular activity making friend or keeping them there were time when my own mother spread malicious lie about the few remaining friend i had just to isolate me at home she ha been diagnosed with histrionic personality disorder and borderline sociopathic tendency so i never fell short of any abuse throughout my teenage year i wa thusly isolated it been six year since ive had good sleep since ive gotten severe chronic insomnia with a weekly average of  hour of sleep per night it is not an overestimation this is my current depressing life also i have been physically sick for around  year now with certain condition which affected my hormone and kidney function i have been diagnosed with ptsd since  year of age and recent turn of event have made it worsei have written so much at this point im not sure if anyone would read the whole thing and honestly ive tried to keep it short enough so that people understand or at least have an idea of where im coming from so a i said i wa counting on college to start a life to gain the thing id never had the opportunity to im already  and going to uni prolly in the next year by that time i will be  already starting college with people two year my junior i dont think i  can ever have a proper college experience anymore having fun with friend normal healthy relationship not being scared of study cause im a good student but everything yes im not sure or count on many people understanding my situation but i just dont know how i will interact with people so much younger than me i feel bad because i never got to age gracefully a in never got to act my age be a child when im  be a teen when i am one and now im two year behind in college a repetition of the same trend never getting to live my age youre probably going to say hey a lot of people start late but thats a minority you find in college  a minority not a majority and no one will get it really being a part of the minority is itself a harsh reminder of everything i never got to have and i feel crushed by it i dont even know why i am writing this here maybe some latenight rant but yeah ive not been able to focus on wanting anything anymore i have been suicidal since i wa twelve due to the torture m parent and those friend put me through i just dont see a life where everything pan out anymore a in i cant hope to achieve a future where all this pain would have been worth it dont get alarmed i am not suicidal but i am craving death i dont plan to kill myself ever but i ask god for death because nothing seems worth it every time thing got unbearable i used to tell myself hey it just for now thing will be better by the time im  then  came i wa like hey thing would get better by the time  im  that happened too and well life is anything but better i feel like im pretty enough for bad thing to come out of it but never anything good and now i just feel ugly and worthlessyou know my best friend shes like super pretty and super kind a well and i love her dont get me wrong and i want the best for her but every time she come to mind i keep asking what is it about me that wa worth enough to deserve any of this how wa i any le than her for me to deserve this kind of life and her to be spared from it i never want what happened to me to happen to her and i only want the best for her but why am i worth any le for me to be deprived of every goodness this world ha to

1815,hey everyone i am new to this thread and wanted to find a group of people who understand the complexity of ptsd my ptsd doe not stem from combat but instead from very traumatic event in my teen year i am in therapy but wanted to shoot my shot at advice from others who live with ptsdat  i married a guy from my high school who had gone into the military while i wa wrapping up senior year once done i moved with him and looked forward to starting our life unfortunately thing got bad almost a soon a i moved out there were rumor he cheated on me and he wa often getting in trouble with the military police for drinking i ignored these however a my ex is very charming and often wa able to weasle his way out of thing at one point i told him i wa done and ended up going back after returning i found out i wa pregnant we were both excited and i stupidly thought this would be a new chapter of love and happiness wrong a my pregnancy progressed i wa placed on bedrest from  week on i wa so tired most day all i could do wa sleep my doctor tried everything but to no avail my body changed and i wa miserable my teen year were plagued with eating disorder and i struggled to accept how my body wa changing in the beautiful moment my ex made comment on my body often and said he would only buy me new clothes if i lost the baby weight soon after labor he would drink to the point he would blackout and i would need to go pick him up and bring him home  a few week before i gave birth i caught him cheating again and printed out divorce paper and told him i wa done he asked for time and due to my health and the short amount of time left i allowed it when my baby wa born it felt a though thing would change he wa suddenly a doting father and wanted to show the world his baby my baby fixed everything wrong in my world and suddenly life had more purpose unfortunately me not holding firm on my boundary and choosing to stay had almost deadly consequence week after becoming a mom i decided to get some alone time and met with some friend for shopping and lounging about time i received a call from my ex who wa frantic and asked when i would be home something felt wrong and off a this wa unusual and so i hurried to leave after my ex said the baby wa just fussy i hurried home and walked in to see my baby white a a ghost and with a giant bruise on their beautiful face i lost it and grabbed my baby and sat down and cried i asked my ex what happened and he told me that the baby had hit their head on a toy and he didnt know what happened i said that baby dont just get black eye and i immediately rushed to the hospital the er staff rushed u back and suddenly the doctor come in and tell me my baby had been shaken and ha shaken baby syndrome they need to transfer them to a childrens hospital immediately and authority are on their way my world ended i froze after the doctor told me my baby had blood in their brain a small fracture on their face and potentially leg a well i broke down and remember going stone cold the anger the hurt the pain i wanted to cause my ex who had hurt my innocent baby i shut down and refused to feel anymore all that mattered wa my baby an officer came in and asked for detail and then he outright accused me of lying i told him to gtfo and once i knew my baby wa where they needed to be and he listened rather than automatically assuming i wa lying we could talk at this point i had texted my ex who said he had arrived at the hospital i had refused to let him come with me the officer refused him entering and once the doctor had gotten my baby into the ambulance for transfer a detective from a different agency came in he wa kind showed empathy and i felt safe with him he said he could not disclose where my child wa being taken until he talked to my ex and i and that we needed to come with him he asked if i wanted to drive myself or ride with him i told him to take my ex a i wa concerned he would try to leave and i followed in my car we get to the station and they bring me in for questioningthey sat me back down after i gave them my day activites and took my ex in next they come out a short while later saying he admitted to hurting my baby and i wa free to go and they told me where to go they said i could see him beforehand if i wanted and numbingly i said ok a soon a i got into the room my ex look sad and tried to hug me i pulled away and said what the hell were you thinking he said they told him i wouldnt see my baby if he didnt confess and so he felt he had to so i could go to the hospital i wa furious the lie continued and he wa already scheming of how he could get out of this i left and went to find my babyi get to the hospital and it wa the worst place i could have imagined it wa dark the room looked like low light jail cell the nurse were cold cruel and looked at me a though it wa my fault i had no family no money no clothes no food nothing home wa  hour away and i had no one to help me the nurse made comment on how i should have been with my baby the entire time and i felt helpless and like i wa a terrible mom i wanted to be with my baby but at  with no family money or friend i had no choice i had to witness terrible procedure to make sure my baby would be able to see they believed the retina had become detatched and that they may be blind there wa blood in her eye and they couldnt confirm but they believed a fracture wa slightly visible on their leg and face they told me that they may have vision issue and may have developmental delay but wa expected to surviveafter baby wa discharged i then had to deal with public defender cps and judge and court i finally received permission to leave the state and returned home all my friend were off to college living their life and most thought me a liar my ex and his family had begun damage control before i even returned and so when i did i found myself with few friend i wa young numb unsure of how to navigate my new normal i didnt know what mental health really wa or how to move forward a month went on my ex wa convicted and released with time served the judge did not take his right i wa blown away and wanted to never see him again unfortunately with no money i could not afford an attorney to fight when he returned home a year later he wa granted supervised visitation he battled drinking and anger problem still and i wa terrified something would happen again at this point we were still legally married i had begun dating an old school flame who had taken on the father role beautifully and wa absolutely smitten with baby my ex did not like this and said he had a right to know who wa around his baby i told him i had been deemed the best fit for parenting my baby and i wa in my right to see him a wa my baby i did not allow alone time with them for quite a while finally we divorce and he is granted unsupervised visit my baby beat the odds and wa developing rapidly and had no lingering effect from injury at this point baby is walking and talking and able to communicate betterm i felt ok with this and continued to keep a close eye for any problem my new relationship wa flourishing and thing started to look up i continued to battle my feeling when baby wa not around id go drinking with coworkers and just engage in behavior that wa not healthy or condusive to healing i fought with my boyfriend struggled with money and struggled to cope after  year my boyfriend and i bought a house and moved that wa the year i hit rock bottom i struggled to meet people i felt alone and struggled with how to cope my new coworkers and i would go out drinking and to the casino and it got to a point my boyfriend called me out i knew change needed to happen and i owed it to my baby to be the best i could be i sobered up and stopped going out i changed job and began to live by a budget we got a dog and that helped tremendously my ex moved closer with his new girlfriend and thing seemed to be going well shortly after my boyfriend proposed and thing just looked better and better my ex and i overall communicated ok but he had multiple time begged to get back together and often would get angry and defensive if i brought up a problem or concern a drinking wa a big issue still for him when it wa parenting time my boyfriend and i ended up getting married and buying a new home a month later in  i started seeing a therapist and really working to continue to make positive change my pre teen is now in a stable environment with me and is kind smart and onto big thing thing were perfect until they werent my ex called me on my baby birthday and said there had been an accident but everyone wa ok my baby wa with him and so i wa scared but felt something wa off at the same time sure enough i get a call from cps that he wa arrested for a duo with my child in the car i wa furious i filed for emergency custody the same day and told him i knew and what i wa doing that night i went to pick up my child pet from them and see his gf is cry a she had been in the accident also and he proceeds to come outside and give me all the item he start saying how he sorry and i go off i tell him i cant trust him and that i am furious and my only concern is my child safety court day come and the judge proceeds to tell me that our child need both of u and proceeds to send kiddo with him with no restriction no proof of sobriety nothing i wa floored this triggered a lot of memory to come back and i have found that i am struggling to move forward again a the court sent kiddo back saying they were old enough  to be aware if they were in danger and they could call me at this point my attorney said we could appeal but most likely nothing would come from it i wa devastated now my ex barely reach out never asks about a report card doctor visit didnt go to one sport game this season or even ask kiddo how it went because he cant drive he chooses to have no active part except for his  day a month i always offered extra time for him to rarely acceptnow where i am struggling and need advice i want to heal i will never forget but i am tired of intrusive memory of all those year ago coming back so vividly i have made great progress but feel a though something is missing i have felt the need to get closure by asking my ex to talk through all those year ago i tend to move forward by fitting piece together like a puzzle we never discussed it after and rarely bring it up today if you could confront the main reason for your trauma would you and why would you choose your decisionthank you ahead of time to any and all advice and for bearing with my long story,anxiety

1818,so ive been in a coercively controlling relationship where my ex convinced everyone around me i wa crazy and had another relationship with a girl who threatened to suicide if i called her out i wa so miserablethis friend kind of pried into this time of my life due to not seeing each other for a long time and then she told me i should have told people what i wa going through when i appeared flaky or disconnected from them i did but not to a deep level so people still got upset and were incredibly harsh on me and a few time it pushed me to selfharm i didnt tell my friend this partand to be honest these people didnt treat me with respect the first place and i feel much better after cutting them out from my end i wa doing the best i can and tried to appear normal and keep most of my problem to myself this wa a friend i had since high school and i found myself distancing myself more and more because what she said caused me to revisit my trauma again and feel like i deserved it so then i decided to tell her what i went through then she told me i wa trauma dumping and i only needed to tell people i wa having a hard time but i thought i did and it didnt work so how would you guy tell someone a topic is really bad for you to go into and unsolicited advice can retraumatise you all again without trauma dumping is just telling people im having a bad time enough what if it doesnt work on some people then can i trauma dump or is it better to just set a boundary and drift away slowly never explaining to even my closest friend why i might have been uncomfortable enough to do so,anxiety

talking so i turned and looked at her and she wa frozen with chip sticking out of her mouth  i even though an disabled got up and stuck my finger in her mouth to remove the food and then called  and shut the door so dad couldnt see in his frail age so they talked to mum and she couldnt respond but only with drooping face and couldnt move her left arm they ripped her up from the chair using a metal board and pulling her my her pant and rolled her into a wheelchair in the hallway at this time mum had a tear running down the left side her face i cant stop thinking of and remembering this  so we are called by ed icu and told she ha a bloodclot in her brain and they want to go in and retrieve it to what both dad and i agreed yes plesse save mum they went to go in and they said the blood clot dissolved and thats a food sign a now she ha no clotting we asked to speak to her but wa not allowed the next day tbe th of oct we were told that everything look good and she will recover i   day but will need rehabilitation to what me and dad were more then happy to do for mum i spoke to mum that day and asked do you want u to come in snd she said no a i moved out my room to lay down with dad in his i said to mum on phone you know me and dad love you with everything dont you mum she replied  i love you both too  very slurred speaking then they nurse said she ha to sleep because shes very drowsy sigh so about  ours later we get a call from the hospital saying we should come in to see her  me being disabled and dad with aortic stenosis said why whats going on and they said the small clot that moved after they dissolved from the big clot ha caused massive internal bleeding in her brain and she ha  hour to live  dad and me sorted a taxi and wheelchair from hospital to meet u etc we went in to see mum when we got there mum wa comatose and it wa heart breaking me and dad sat with mum getting her to squeeze our hand or push her foot against our hand to respond a they say hearing is the last to go da got up to kiss mum and then went all funny with giddiness and head and chest pain  he wa taken down to ed and he wa admitted to that hospital emergency department  i had porter push me down to see dad and back up to mum they said dad kidney failed i went back up with my beautiful mother and sat next to her talking and cry until late in the morning and asked the nurse for a

1885,im just feeling so empty and overwhelmed right now recently i wa diagnosed with ptsd due to an experience i had a few year ago and im feeling a lot of inner conflict about it i had spent the night partying with a friend of mine the day afterwards i think we had smoked a joint or something and they had asked me if i wanted to have sex with them i wa unsure about it but because i wa a virgin i wanted to try i also have a condition that make penetration quite painful most of the time which i did express to them we had done some foreplay which wa all consensual i think that they had inserted their finger without asking first but i didnt tell them to stop a we began having sex i noticed that it wa extremely painful for me i wa very uncomfortable but i think i felt like i should just let it happen after a while this became basically unbearable so i asked them to stop and expressed that it wa painful they just responded with come on just  more second which i didnt really want to but i think i just kind of let them keep going it hurt so bad and they couldnt even get inside me properly so i did ask them to stop once again and they responded with fine and rolled over i think they were annoyed that they couldnt penetrate me properly after this i didnt feel upset or anything but i felt really weird overall it wa an extremely unpleasant experience for me and i really didnt like it but i think i just tried to pretend that it wa just an underwhelming first time because i wa glad to have gotten it over with a few month later i wa in class and my teacher wa showing this video about consent during sex and i think i just broke down cry and had a panic attack i hadnt really considered my experience to be negative in that way until that point i think i had just sort of thought that maybe sex wasnt for me and that i didnt enjoy it after i had opened up about this experience to my teacher and my boyfriend at the time they had both told me that it sounded like rape it wa at this point where i started to have panic attack and flashback but i had continued to believe that i wa just being overly dramatic and that it wasnt really rape my boyfriend said i should tell our friend about it though because everyone wa still talking to them and they were still in all of our group chat which i agreed to nobody wanted to be friend with them anymore after this and cut them off from the group about a year later i got a call from my friend who had basically said to me that this person had raped multiple people and their exgirlfriend just made a post calling them out about it i had a complete hysterical breakdown like i absolutely lost my shit and started screaming i dont know why my reaction to this wa so strong i just remember it being extremely distressing i asked if i could speak to the exgirlfriend about the situation to which she agreed what she had said to me wa so horrific and unlike anything i had even thought them to be capable of doing they had raped her multiple time a well a hitting her during sex choking her and trying to trigger her during sex by reenacting her previous traumatic experience she sent screenshots where they had admitted their guilt in text so they were clearly aware of what they had done they had also coerced an underage girl into sex and sexually blackmailed others online i asked her if they had ever acknowledged my situation and she told me that they had said that some psycho girl accused me of rape but i never did it she asked me to stop and i did which frankly kind of destroyed meevery single day i question if it wa truly rape if i wa just being dramatic and why i cant just stop being so hung up about it i mean they did literally stop when i asked them to the second time right i cant argue against that no matter how hard i try and think about it theyre obviously a terrible person but i just dont know if what i went through wa that bad i wish i had just forgotten about it and moved on rather than spending so much time forcing myself to relive it over and over again trying to work it out i still dont really believe it and i dont know if i ever will i just feel like i dont deserve to even have ptsd like it wasnt life threatening or something it wa just a bad bad experience sometimes i wish it had been worse and that they hadnt listened to me at all which i feel extremely guilty about but it just this uncertainty that drive me insane sorry for such a long post,anxiety

1941,when i wa a kid around  to  i had two really traumatic thing happen to me that i dont remember at all this post is about when i wa around  to  and my dad lived with two different roommate because he couldnt afford to live on his own the first place he lived in wa with this couple named rachel and ryan ryan wa most probably an aggressive alcoholic back then i didnt know about alcohol so i dont even know if he did drink but from what i know now about alcohol abuse it definitely seems like it his house wa like a war zone it wa extremely messy and he had like  four or five kid who he would verbally abuse constantly right in front of me but wa always nice to me cause i wasnt his kid i dont ever distinctly remember him hitting his kid but i wouldnt be surprised if he did it behind closed door seeing a he wa nasty to them in front of me the other place i lived in with my dad wa with a single mom named stephenie who wa a heroin addict she wa actually much nicer than ryan and tbh whenever i remember her she just seemed really tired and groggy which make a lot of sense now seeing that she did heroin i actually enjoyed being there because she had two daughter who were around  and  at the tome and they were extremely fun and great babysitter almost even too good and happy i say this because like now when i remember it there no reason that two teenage daughter should ever be that happy to babysit a ten year old so i think it wa their escape but idk im just theorizing the only weird experience i had at that place wa one night when i wa watching a movie by myself it wa the animated movie  i remember specifically at their house and stephenie came into the room i wa only in and she proceeded to take off all her clothes  she wa acting kinda strange so idk if she wa super high and didnt notice me that what i thought a a kid i just stayed silent in the corner and didnt say anything cause it wa super awkward the weirdest part for me is my memory after i just dont remember what happened next despite remember many specific detail around the situation  like the movie and the room and image of her standing naked in the door frame how doe this differ from your childhood and what do yall honestly think about my childhood,anxiety

1945,ive been becoming increasingly aware that the baseline of stress i operate at is definitely unhealthy the thing is ive become so used to being constantly go go go at high intensity the thought of doing meditation or something calming is incredibly unappealing i dont want to have to be still ironically if i do take time to calm down when i actually get there it really nice but i despise that  minute window i between where you have to make the conscious choice to slow and calm down before you feel relaxed i feel it an avoidance technique that need to be dealt with but just sharing my observation here,anxiety

1974,over the past day i received a lot of comment and advice regarding my  post here on reddit about my experience with my doctor  thank you  kindly to everyone who took the time to share their thought the  doctor had carressed my face during a check up and said cute little  thing while doing so and i wa trying to find out if he behaved  inappropriately while reading through and engaging with comment and  thinking about my time a a patient with him more and more detail and  memory started popping up suddenly and today everytime i thought  about certain moment i could feel myself starting to panic and it wa  difficult to calm down there a memory in particular that just  resurfaced today that bother and stress me out immensely and i am not  sure what to do with it most of it is quite blurry and fuzzy but i  think i am starting to make more sense of the little scene that keep  popping up which is scary the memory is from a few year ago when i  had a  hour surgery and wa in my doctor care right after the thing i  remember happened a little while after waking up from anesthesia i  think probably a couple hour later but i wa still completely out of  it and groggy and just able to lay in bed if i remember correctly at  that point my doctor came in to check on me he and i were alone in that  room i remember that we were laughing about a silly joke that i think i  made and then that harmless banter escalated in to something super  weird and strange i think i wa in pain and hyperventilating or  something like that and he pulled some pill out of his pocket and gave  me one of them i think he took one a well but i am not sure about  that it hard to remember after that there really strange snippet  of him sitting on the side of the bed and holding me my head resting  on his shoulder cry desperately then him doing something  that i cant quite recall or pinpoint but i feel like it wa quite  physical and there wa a lot of movement and commotion and everytime my  thought try to go there and figure it out i start to feel like  blacking out and panicking again heavy chest hard to breathe type of  feeling i hear his voice clearly saying over and over again it  okay hey hey it going to be okay dont cry it okay it okay  im here it okay and i think i wa asking him a lot of question  but couldnt get him to respond it this horrible feeling of being  trapped almost like sleep paralysis today is the first time i ever  remembered or thought of this stuff i threw up because of it and  couldnt focus on work all day and just feel like hiding in a room not  talking to anyone in person im not quite sure whats going on with me  and i dont know if this is something like ptsd or not but could someone  please give me some advice on what to do or what this even mean this  is overwhelming i impulsively wanted to try to call my doctor and hoped  hed be able to help me understand what my memory is about but then i  realized it probably would be a stupid idea and thankfully renounced  but for some reason i feel the urge to talk to him while i feel scared  at the same time i have an appointment with him soon so thats  stressing me out a well i will probably have to cancel that although i  just want answer to be honest and to talk this through with him this  cant just be in my head,anxiety
