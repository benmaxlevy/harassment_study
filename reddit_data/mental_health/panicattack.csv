93,i am not sure why  but ever since i wa a child  i have always attributed my panic attack to stomach pain  i attribute stomach pain to eating  i do not recall a trauma associated with food or stomach pain  it just is a random trigger i guess   that lead to menot eating  which of course actually make my panic attack much worse and thus the cycle continues  i hate panic disorder   do you have a food that you feel is easy to digest with panic attack  do you have a food that simply help panic attack due to texture  temperature  or other therapy technique  do you have a food that you try to incorporate regardless due to nutritional component that help panic attack  note  my psychiatrist previously suggested ensure  but honestly i think such a condensed drink of nutrient wa too much for my stomach to handle ,anxiety

95,hello friend  i hope youre in a place you feel safe and are doing well  a few month ago i took a probiotic and ended up in the er with intense anxiety  which a week or so later turned into the worst experience of my life  a horrific panic attack  alone at about   or   am  i wa totally traumatized from it  this anxiety state lasted about   month  im only now starting to get better  i have never gone through anything worse  but here the important thing  my panic wa caused by dysbiosis  which is an imbalance of bacteria in the gut  most people that stuffer from anxiety or panic would never think that it could be caused from their digestive tract  but this  in my opinion  is the first place we should look    here some important question if you suffer from panic attack or depersonalization or derealization  what do you eat and how often do you go to the bathroom    if your small intestine move too slowly toxin can leech into your bloodstream and cause all kind of problem  including anxiety and panic  this can mess with your nervous system    look  this wont explain every person panic  but it a good place to start because some people might not realize that their panic is actually coming from their gut  food ha to travel    foot through the small intestine before it get to the large intestine  thats a long way and if it move too slow it can mess with our health   if this is the case the solution is a healthy diet and exercise  coupled with social interaction  merely restoring movement should bring some relief  and on top of this we have to eat to consciously cultivate healthy bacteria in our digestive tract  that is  eating to support our gut health  the gut brain connection is very real and very powerful and still incredibly new  dont underestimate it   one more thing  if you have a silent acid reflux this can also manifest a anxiety  even raising blood pressure  i had this and didnt know it because i didnt have any heartburn  but after i drank some baking soda the acid  and then anxiety  went away  it hard to interpret the feeling we have in our body  be well and get support wherever you can ,anxiety

99,hey   m and a of last   month i ve been experiencing a lot of anxiety  i moved across country   month ago and have struggled to find a job and because of that i don t really talk to anyone or go anywhere so i d normally stay up late and wake up late  however one day i didn t get out of bed until  pm when it wa already night time and i had my first panic attack  it eventually went away after an hour or so after getting some fresh air and i slept normal that night  however the day after i started shaking about    minute after waking up and went to the urgent care where they did blood work and an ekg and found my electrolyte were all messed up and abnormal ekg  i went home with a referral for a cardiologist whom i wouldn t see for a week  that entire week i d shake  have bad anxiety and occasionally wake up at night shaking severely for about an hour every other night  eventually that went away and the day where i d talk to the cardiologist came and he did an ekg where everything wa fine and he brushed me off  however since he could tell i wa still worried about what wa wrong with me he gave me the option of wearing a holter monitor for two day  and a stress test so i opted for that and i haven t had any issue with my heart since except occasionally palpitation  anyways i m now almost always worried somethings wrong with me when i ve never experienced anxiety or panic attack like this in the past  i ve been to the er twice because i thought something wa wrong with me and every test they took even a full comprehensive blood test came back fine  anyways now my most recent fixation is that i may have parkinson since it can change your brain chemistry and also the bad insomnia i ve had lately  some constipation  which ha been getting better  and light trembling in my hand when i for example hold my phone one handed or stick my arm out  i don t have a resting tremor  besides the occasional feeling of uneasiness and occasional nocturnal panic attack i relatively feel fine other than thinking i may have parkinson s sound stupid i know   when all this started i d never drink water and have one or two energy drink daily but i ve since cut out caffeine and prioritize water and i still have anxiety  i don t know why i m posting this i guess i m just looking for some input if suddenly developing severe anxiety or possibly gad is normal ,anxiety

103,the way i describe my panic attack is like this      there a trigger  gt  increased anxiety throughout the day  usually unnoticed or brushed off a something else  gt  ill be doing a random act in autopilot when my brain begin to panic  gt  denial of panic attack  try to push through  gt  become incapacitated by anxiety  heart race  tunnel vision  impending doom  etc  gt  come down fairly quickly through grounding talking it out  gt  pure exhaustion and slight dissociation for hour after    and then the aftershock begin  usually the next day start okay  but my brain is on alert and im hyper aware of any bit of anxiety i feel  so im more likely to have another attack if i let it get out of hand  or im more likely to push myself into thinking im going to have one when im not  i usually have one close call  and a few increasingly smaller blip of anxiety  it can last anywhere from a day to a week   i genuinely feel a though i have ptsd from panic attack  because the thought of having one is terrifying  i know that they are harmless but they are scary  and i think it okay to be apprehensive about something that scare you even though it doesnt hurt you  i know they are temporary and ill feel better soon  i just hate the yucky feeling for day after    doe anyone else experience this ,anxiety

119,i have a long history of panic attack  these are thing that help me a an adult  in addition to medication  on a daily basis  tried tested and true for me     ice pack   warm pack on the chest   this can help center you and lower your heart rate  i use heating pad or even a hot bath  on the go  i keep vapor rub on me  always  whenever i feel my throat getting tight  i put some on my chest  and it make my heart rate slow and for me to breathe better     exercise  i know  i know   i know   i despise exercise  so  hear me out   this is the mandatory  it is good for you  splurb   regular exercise is beneficial in so many way  my mom stand by this testament for managing her own panic disorder   this is the  good shit  splurb   i find that anything to keep busy and raise your heart rate healthily  opting for stair  speed cleaning  hard sweeping  and mopping  are just a beneficial  the point is to exercise your cardiac system in a controlled way  whatever it is  if you re breaking a sweat or have a faster heart rate   it s because you re in control  and can help you get through the more mundane part of your day that may be triggering    working on communication skill  sometimes  panic and anxiety episode can be triggered by thing in our life  in the event of this  i find that dealing with problem head on  especially when it come to people in my life  take immense effort in communication  if i don t talk to someone about a problem i ve had with them  it toll on me  keep me up at night  and add on to so much pre existing stress  working on communication skill ha also enabled me to set harder boundary with people  through direct communication  the people in my life understand to respect my boundary  if i m having a bad day  i won t be able to attend life event  the people who love me understand this  they only understand this because i worked heavily on my communication skill  people who really love you only know what you tell them  they want to understand and help   even if that mean you may miss some event     keep an extra bottle of a needed stuff  nothing is worse than not having something you need so bad  this part can be difficult depending on your doctor  a good place to start would be with your healthcare professional     have regular and consistent conversation with your doctor  they can only help you with the information they have  even if you re managing well with your current plan   tell them that   new study are constantly emerging     grounding technique     box breathing  breathe in for   second  hold for   second  let go for   second  the purpose of this is to continue repeatedly until your heart and breathing slow       by    think of a category  and list   thing within that category such a green thing around you  repeate with a new category  the point is to center yourself     learn how to listen and respond to your body  yeah  panic can be triggered or out of the blue  we have all been there  you don t know what will and what won t work for you without trying  if something repeatedly trigger you  you have to find way to manage that trigger  avoiding life is not an option  the goal is to  manage  the symptom  don t let the symptom manage  you   for some people  that s meditation  journaling  art  creating  relaxing  etc  i do some of those thing  too  it s a needed  it depends  panic is complex  you don t know if it ll help unless you try it    all the above is tried  tested  and true for my own journey  i do these thing constantly at the minimum to live my life  they may help you  too  i highly recommend these thing be used  in addition  to medication and therapy service  therapy can provide a lot of tool for you to try beyond what i have listed ,anxiety

122,last night i woke up and my heart wa pounding so hard  i cant even explain how fast it wa and i took off running from my bed to the door in my room  i ran to the bathroom and sat down  on the toilet and my face wa numb and tingling and my nose felt like somebody wa pinching it  i also could not breathe  i felt like it wa really hard to get a breath in and i went to the living room and sat down on the couch and my mom came in there and i wa freaking out cry and my vision wa blurry and my eye started swelling up an itching really bad and they were red and i couldnt breathe and my mouth and throat were dry  i thought i wa dying  i told my mom please help me im going to die  she told me that she would not call the ambulance because they come out all the time when thing like this happened and i wa ok i just needed to calm down and she walked me through it  when i tell you this wa bad i think this is the worst one ive ever had and ive even passed out from a panic attack and nothing is a scary a this waking up thinking you were dying  i thought i wa in fight or flight mode i didnt know what to do  it wa like someone shot a gun in my room and i just took off running out of my room with a pounding heart  keep in mind this happened out of a dead sleep  i wa freaking out and i hit my inhaler and drink some water and after about    minute of literally feeling like i wa dying  i started feeling a little bit better  i did end up going back to sleep after about   hour of being up and this all happened about   am  after i calm down  my mom smoked a cigarette on the porch and i wa scrolling through my phone trying to see if anyones ever had these symptom from taking prozac because i just started prozac about a week and a half ago and since the night that i took it  i started having itchy eye  shortness of breath and whelp  i thought this wa due to staying with my friend who had a cat and i am severely allergic  i took two benadryl before i went over there just so i could get through the night and help him arrange the house for a showing  because he wa selling it  well  after a few hour of taking my medication prozac that night  i started having trouble breathing and i felt like it wa an asthma attack and i havent had one since i wa seven and im    now and they told me i outgrew my childhood asthma so i thought well it cant be the cat because the benadryl is working because my eye are not swelling shut and my nose is not running  fast forward a few day i finally came home and i took a shower took some zyrtec and i still felt the same way and i thought it wa my allergy but i wa taking two or three benadryl every day up until yesterday morning at   am when i woke up having a panic attack  ive been having breathing problem since i started this medicine and here i am thinking that it just from the cat allergy and being around my friend cat and i dont think that it wa the cat that wa bothering me because ive never had a reaction that bad with my breathing and a i said  my eye werent bothering me and my nose wasnt running  i think it is the prozac because i usually take it in the morning and i wa having the breathing problem and the rash that i developed a few day after i started taking it so when i took it at night and went to sleep i woke up  not able to breathe with lot of mucus in my lung  my eye were itching and swollen and im having trouble with my vision and i hit my inhaler and i felt better but i think i wa having a panic attack on top of it  im not sure what happened this morning at   am but i think it from the prozac and im no longer taking it  i havent taken it today and the only reason i think it hasnt got a bad a it did this morning at   am is because ive been taking benadryl every day throughout the day and it keeping my histamine level low and i forgot to take it last night and after everything calm down  i took the zyrtec and i felt better and all the itching went away  if anyone can give me any insight on this  please do because i dont know if it the prozac  causing an allergic reaction and worsening my anxiety or if it just my anxiety causing these feeling  ive never had anxiety or panic cause mucus in my lung  itching  eye  or a panic attack this bad so im not sure if it wa an allergic reaction to prozac with an anxiety and panic attack on top of it  all i know is that i am tired of suffering and going through this on a regular basis  it just seems like my panic attack get worse  every time i have one in every medicine i have tried is hit or miss  i do want to try snris because ive been on ssri and none of them seem to help enough and ive heard that snris work quicker and work better to lower norepinephrine and boost  serotonin and dopamine  i know that the withdrawal effect or worse with snris but if it going to help me  im going to try it  i really wish i could just be normal again and never have to take medicine for the rest of my life  im only    and im tired of suffering with this and im tired of taking all kind of medication and them only working for a short period of time and then stopping working or them not working at all ,anxiety
123,i struggle with a lot of mental health issue that cause a lot of challenge in my day to day life  i look around on the internet and there are a lot of people sharing their story and i want to share mine a well  so  i thought the best place to start would be my first panic attack   my first panic attack happened when i wa    year old  about   year ago  in my grade    physic class   we had a reading period for the first    minute of our second class everyday when everyone wa silent  sat at their desk  and got to read whatever book they had at the time  i personally loved reading period but something wa different that day and it wasn t something i could really predict  i didn t feel any different going into the class but a soon a i sat down it started   i sat at my desk in the front row and the classroom wa completely silent  i started to feel this sensation in my chest and in my leg quickly buildinga numb tingly feeling in my leg and a tightness in my chest  my heart started to beat fast and my breathing started getting short  if you ve ever experienced a panic attack you know that these are the telltale sign but i had no idea what wa happening  i wa very uncomfortable so i immediately ran out of the room in front of the whole class which wa not not the best feeling in the world    a i wa feeling all these sensation it became very uncomfortable and i wasn t sure what i needed but i wa positive about what i did  not  need and that wa to be in the classroom any longer  i bolted for the door and ran out of the classroom down the hall to the bathroom and just needed a private place to figure out what wa going on    at the time i had no clue what i wa experiencing and thought i might have been having a heart attack  i had no idea that it wa mental whatsoever  obviously  it had physical symptom but i didn t know that it wa a panic attack  in fact  i hadn t even heard of a panic attack at that time in my life    i remember being in that bathroom terrified and not even knowing what i wa terrified of  like most panic attack it peaked after about    minute and then slowly died away but i wa definitely prepared to go into the hall and get someone to call       or get me to the school nurse to be looked at because i genuinely thought i wa going through a physical attack of some sort  at the time it wa very traumatizing   the way the class were set up  i had that physic class in the same period for the entire week so i had reading period for the first    minute again the following day  i walked into the same class  sat down to do my reading  and again the same sensation hit me  i ran out of the class and i hid away in the washroom waiting for it to go away   it wa around that time that i suspected it wa not physical and wa more mental but i had no idea what wa happening before this point in my life  i wa definitely an anxious kid growing up  i had struggle with mental health before that point in my life but it wa the first time i had experienced something that severe and gripping   essentially  every reading period after that i had to sit in the hallway and read because i didn t know what the cause wa but i wa severely uncomfortable being in the classroom in any of my class when reading period occurred  a time went on i learned about myself  my anxiety  my thought process  and i learned that reading period wa a trigger for my anxiety   it wa one of the thing that would cause panic attack for me because it wa a situation that i felt i couldn t escape from  but at the time i had absolutely no idea what wa going on  i didn t know what a panic attack wa  i didn t know what wa happening to me or why  and i didn t know what wa causing it    all i knew wa that this thing wa having a large impact on my day so i started taking my book and reading outside in the hall for those    minute for all my class  of course  there are a lot worse situation i could have been inat least i wa comfortable in the hallway and didn t have panic attack anymore  but the point i want to hit on is how uneducated i wa and and just how naive i wa about what i wa going through   if i had known what i know now it definitely would have helped me in the long run a lot sooner to identify panic attack and that reading period wa one of the trigger of a panic attack  i dont know why they started but the great thing about anxiety  panic attack  and a lot of mental health issue is that you don t need to know what caused them or why they started  all you have to know is your present situation and learn the skill and solution to your current situation   so  if you re going through any of these thing a well or something even slightly similar then we re in the same boat and i think that hearing other people s story and learning about their experience can really help u with understanding our own circumstance   if i had other people story to read about when i wa in grade    i would have been able to identify the panic attack  i would have started looking up resource for panic attack  why they were happening to me  and coping mechanism for them  i would have discovered meditation and learned breathing exercise   i went through a long period of stumbling through the dark so i think that the major benefit of u sharing story with each other is that those of u who are stumbling through the dark can learn different resource  i think it can shine the light onto the dark corner of mental health that we otherwise wouldn t receive so that s all i really want to do by sharing my story with you   if there s anything that i want to leave you with it that you are  so  much stronger than you know and you need to remember that you are capable of so much more than you believe  it is so important to have faith in yourself even when you feel weak because it help u get through those really tough time like panic attack   i also made a video about this on my youtube channel which you can watch  here

156,desperately need help    this is going to be a long post guy but plz guy if u have a couple of min read it completely and plz give me suggestion so this post is going to be bout my friend say tom we bcm friend back in      during my school time when i wa in  th standard that wa my first day in my new school we bcm friend but he wa normal back then but he left school next year and returned in class   me being his friend approached him but it seemed like he wa changed completely he got abusive for no reason and wa jealous of me cuz i wa surprisingly good in studeus back then so we had a common friend connecting u in school and outside say jerry so what hpnd wa whenever i used to approach tom he used to be verbally abusive with me for no reason he even slapped and pushed me for no reason but seeing me performing good in exam he bcm my friend i thought we would be good friend but it wasn t a i expected i came to know that he bcm my friend just for his selfish purpose and always treated me a a side option to fall on i literally shared all my secret to him but he used to disclose them and would say that he just forgot not to do so i even used to do his homework and he didn t even care about me i have been badly beaten by teacher due to him cuz he used to take my project and would submit it but never ever cared bout me day continued and he got a girlfriend in class    they continued thwir relationship for   year and broke up a primary school wa over and we moved on to next class all of his so called friend changed their school and he wa left with me and jerry u ppl won t believe but i spent almost      yr giving him sympathy and comforting him it wa during the year           then came the lockdown during covid he stopped calling me cuz he got his old friend back a they too were free during the lockdown and they started calling each other whereas me being a fool started thinking he must be in depression i used to text hime call him but he didn t even cared to reply but turn out he wa talking with jerry too i had asked a thousand time to jerry to inform tom to atleast habe a talk with me but after few month when i called him he recieved the call at       am during night he started talking casually i asked him why didn t he receive or call me he said  anyways leave it  but after a few minute he took jerry on conference and he stared yelling at me cussing me with bad word trust me nobody could speak a bad a him he didn t even care bout my family and cussed them too he told that i didn t ever care bout him i used to make him feel inferior u should have comforted me more after breakup he made me feel a if i wa the one who ha committed sin i know that it wasnt me but he wa so abusive that i couldn t even defend myself and wasn t even able tk hang up the call he cussed me atleast for   hr trust me guy i didn t do anything bad instead i wa the one who cared for hime the most he even tried to lush me and jerry infront of a truck it wa funny for him again due to him we were going to die in an accident when we   were riding on a bike and jerry wa driving i wa in the middle and he wa in the back tom knew that i am afraid of high speeding so he knowingly cheered jerry to race the bike and he did it too cuz jerry just turned out to be his puppet but during our ride our bike s tyre got punctured and u know what tom just pushed u and jumped outta the bike when it slowed down we could have died but we survived and he came to u started laughing saying why didn t u guy die   i could have reminded him thode incident on the call but i didn t after hanging up tha call i couldn t sleep cuz he put the situation in such a way that i started thinking that i don t even deserve to live and started having panic attack regularly i called him and cried saying sorry many time he used to say it s okay but if something bad used to happen with him he used to call me and say a if it s only my fault tom wa good looking and i am an average looking boy so i remember whenever i used to feel confident he used to kaugh and say it doesn t suit u he had superiority complex i asked jerry a thousand time that i wanna be a friend of his again cuz i thought maybe i could help tom if he wa in depression he wasn t in depression cuz i really thought that tom ha a lot of potential and could achieve much greater thing in life but he started dominating me in conversation and stuff whenever i used to talk to him casually then i wa so broken that even if something good used to hpn to me i used to think that i don t deserve it i asked jerry to help out he said have a talk with him but i am tired to do the same still no change i know he is a narc and is selfish but still this incident ha given me ptsd and whenever i receive his call or text i immediately get anxious and uncomfortable plz guy if u have any suggestion plz let me know   cuz i am in my    s now and wanna succeed in my life but whenever i do something which make me feel good my find reminds me of his word calling me worthless i have already messed up my engineering exam twice due to him cuz i wasn t able to concentrate on study but i wanna succeed  ,anxiety

228,so today wa the first time in a long time i ve had to deal with anxiety this bad  i had a panic attack about   hour ago now  and i feel my anxiety creeping back up on me again    here s the rundown of my day  i got up around        and jumped through to my desk  ready to get a few thing done today  i stream on twitch and i had a sponsor thing going it wa my last day with that   instead of putting time into cooking breakfast i ordered a coffee and a turkey cranberry toastie  and a chocolate muffin via uber so i could get set up and start my stuff  i usually drink decaf coffee these day with the occasional caffeine one now and then if i need a little pick me up but it s never strong  enough to manage and get through my day  the coffee i ordered however  wasn t a weak one and i found out a little too late    upon drinking it i felt my bodily function pushing everything down to the fire escape a little quicker than i m used to  of course caffeine make the evacuation process a bit more faster than usual  but this wa a lot quicker than expected  i had to run  i wasn t pleasant  i got to my stream and started up  everything wa fine  i had a brief moment where i felt a bit of gas leave me and i knew it wa coffee related too  then i started feeling extremely wired up from it    like full on tinglyness and jitteriness  i felt like my body and mind were running at      which it s just not used to anymore    i wa worrying now a i shouldn t feel like that after just one cup of coffee    i finished up my stream after   and half hour  and tried to chill out a little bit but it didn t help     after maybe and hour or   i thought ok ill go a quick walk round to my mum house  and back  which is probably    minute each way  and that might burn a bit of energy off    i found that it made thing worse  i felt dizzy  i felt like my leg were jelly and i had no physical energy even though my brain wa running super fast    i continued with the walk and then came back home  and decided to lay down and do some breathing    and that wa it   i felt that the more i wa trying to breathe the worse it wa getting even though breathing usually always help me it s my go to    i started feeling all different symptom some extreme that i haven t had in a while  i panicked and called an ambulance    i told them in detail i think it s anxiety i ve had a coffee i think it s stronger than i m used to  i have eaten  i ve had bathroom trouble  and even though i think it s anxiety  those what ifs are telling me otherwise and the physical symptom are more than i am used to or can mentally and emotionally handle now  a paramedic come out  doe all the vitals  and tell me everything is more than great  my hr is a healthy  blood sugar and oxygen are great  blood pressure is fine too    she even did one of the portable ecg scan and it wa all showing healthy sign    so we confirmed anxiety but if i wanted to go to hospital for blood test she could take me    by this point i wa calmer    still shaken and shivering but i wasn t a worried so i said i would probably be ok and that would be that a i already wa feeling like i wasted valuable health worker time over nothing now    i got myself back upstairs threw a hoody on and some comfy sock and then got comfy at my pc    everything wa starting to mellow out a bit for me and i wa feeling that post panic tiredness kick in  great i can finally get some sleep soon    my gf and i are also celebrating our anniversary today i may add so we did have plan to do a lot more after my stream but time ha been taken now due to my panic attack  we decided we would still have time to watch a movie  and eat  however my appetite wa gone by this point  so i said i ll go shower a i feel all dirty from my bathroom bother through the day and freshening up might help me feel better with myself  only once i wa in the shower it started coming back     i got put the shower  got dressed and set my laptop up next to my bed and then got into bed so i could discord call her from here for our movie  we are long distance  but then the jitteryness ha started again     that brings me right here to where i m in bed writing this post wondering if anyone ha had any similar experience with caffeine anxiety triggering a panic    and moreso i wa wondering if me laying down ha had any effect on the caffeine moving back through my body  like a gravity thing  you know i m laying horizontal now so everything at the bottom of my body is now flowing right back through my system  i m sure i heard that wa a thing before    thought    hopefully we have a peaceful movie and i sleep well after    tomorrow is a new day right     thanks for taking the time to read this if anyone did  please note a much a i m suffering physically i am quite high spirited about it i know it ll pas  it s temporary  and it won t harm me in anyway severely  it just suck right now     tldr  drank a really strong coffee at the start of my day  it caused a panic and now i m wondering if laying down is making the caffeine run back through me a i m feeling it again after getting into bed ,anxiety

250,i have always had really bad anxiety but sort of recognized thing more a an adult  i remember a a kid not really understand what anxiety wa and ended up interpretating it a guilt  the feeling are not dissimilar and i would often worry about weird stuff that didn t really matter and looking back a an adult it interesting   i remember when i wa in grade two i wa using a glue stick and i dropped it on the carpet  it got fuzz on it  back then i felt like i d commited some kind of heinous crime  i put it back with the other glue stick so no one would know it wa me and then for the next      hour fixated on this   it grew to disproportionate and irrational level of  guilt  and i finally broke down and told my dad in blur of word which i stumbled over like a   legged horse    i remember my dad s face where he just looked so confused by why i wa so upset about this  after a lot of explaining i think he realized he wasn t missing anything  it wa just a glue stick and i really wa that freaked out  being a teacher himself he just told me that kid mess up glue stick and art supply all the time  accident happen and there a budget for the supply  he then asks me if someone couldn t just wipe it off     and that wa when i realized this wa a totally stupid thing to be guilty about  i mean yeah    it could just be cleaned  why hadnt i thought of that   remembering this a an adult i realize it had nothing to do with the glue stick  i wa anxious all the the time and school made me more anxious and i think that wa actually the first panic attack i can remember  dropping the glue made me panic and my anxiety boiled over and it just fixated on what happened to be in front of me at the time  a slightly dirty glue stick    i realized this because started to realize i still do it  it s not so much that my thought or environment make me anxious  it s usually that i m anxious and panicked and it will latch onto pretty much anything and blow it so far out of proportion that i feel like i must be a monster because of an intrusive thought  i must be a terrible person because i accidentally stole someone pen  whatever it is just get magnified    i guess the difference a an adult is it s gotten easier to understand whats happening  identify it and then try to focus on calming the root anxiety itself rather than fighting the thought and worry  because when i m calm i dont worry about those thing  still not great at doing this  still beat myself about weird stuff and ob and still frequently neurotic and panicked but i think even just knowing what it is and knowing what to do even if it very very hard to do is still better than not knowing what wa happening or why and not knowing what i wa supposed to do ,anxiety

264,ive been suffering from bad panic attack for the last month  and ive been turning to historical literary source to see what panic disorder ha looked like over time  i am a scholar of renaissance literature so i cant help myself   i recently came across a fascinating passage from the      book the anatomy of melancholy by robert burton  and im finding it strangely comforting to see how people have been struggling with this awful phenomenon for age  ive pasted the passage below  which describes bodily sensation of panic that are very familiar to me  such a palpitation  sudden temperature change  and a fainting feeling  syncope   burton also describes how the imagination can create the feeling of what it most fear  fear make the imagination conceive what it list  want    another thing i like about the passage below is that burton pepper his description with all manner of ancient writer who also describe various form of panic  to be sure  a lot of this would be considered very outdated by today psychological expert  but to me  burton is clearly describing the feeling i have encountered during my worst episode  sharing in case anyone else find it helpful to see that human

273,ok y all i need some clarification    if you have done cbt  you might have done the internal panic exercise before  you have to give an anxiety rating on a scale for each of the exercise and practice them    the activity are like  breathing through a straw  spinning around on a chair  purposely hyperventilating yourself etc    now i definitely experience my fair share of panic attack out and about in the real world  but these exercise never match up to what a real panic attack feel like    like  sure i can spin around on a chair or hold my breath etc etc  but it just doesn t give me the same impending doom sensation that a real life situation would give    do other people experience this too  or do these exercise work for you ,anxiety
274,hey guy  i m a   m and this ha been a pretty rough week for me  i work overnights at a pet hotel and have for a little over a year now  for the most part  i do maintenance all night  but i m supposed to do an hourly checkup on the pet  which  from the rule of my job  need to get done within the hour  the   am check need to be done between   am and   am for example   but i am very much a stickler for doing it every hour on the hour   on wednesday night going into thursday  i did my initial walkthrough with the closing manager  and she mentioned a dog that wa having some health concern  i ll call her d for privacy reason  and wanted me to keep an extra eye on her  which is pretty normal for the most part though the dog had just checked in right before we closed and hadn t been there long  the manager go home and i start working on the maintenance part of my job until about       pm when i did my first solo walkthrough of the night to check on everyone  when i reached d around        she wa unresponsive to me clicking the lock on the door  so i went in and called her name  then clapped my hand together and still nothing  so i immediately called the closing manager  i m not supposed to leave the store unless someone else is in the building to take dog to the vet   she ended up getting there around midnight to take d to the vet  but unfortunately d wa suffering from bloat  a condition where the dog will eat  be too active and the stomach flip  which is a coin flip on the odds of survival i ve been told  and the pet parent decided to euthanize her  everyone i ve talked to since ha told me i did great in how i handled everything  and though i wa in tear at the end of my shift when i got to my car  i felt like i had fully accepted the situation by the end of my next shift   fast forward to my shift of friday night going into saturday  last night if you re reading this on the day it got posted   and around   am  there wa small dog  i ll call her s  who managed to get stuck inside of a blanket with a thick thread of the blanket wrapped tightly around her neck  i immediately went and grabbed scissors to cut the blanket off and wa able to  but the second i got it off  i immediately burst into tear and started hugging s  i went to go finish the rest of my walkthrough still cry  i thought i could manage  but when started working on setting up the room for the next day s arrival  that s when it all hit me  i wa cry and wa starting to breathe more and more heavily  before leaning against the wall  and eventually curling up in a ball on the floor  i called my overnight coworker  and she wa able to help me calm down  i told the opening manager about it and said i need a mental health day and took today off   all in all  i really don t know how to feel  i ve never been through a situation like with d before  and if the situation with s had happened any other week i probably would ve been fine  but everything just culminated in that moment  i m not really looking for praise of any kind for how i handled everything  and i don t really feel like i want to be comforted  i m just really confused and feel weak and vulnerable right now and just wanted someone to listen  and maybe some advice moving forward if anyone ha had a similar experience    thanks for reading if you got this far  and remember to give your pet all the live they deserve ,anxiety

311,okay so  this is gonna sound really silly  keep in mind english is not my first language  so sorry for any mistake  there is a stray cat in the neighbourhood  i ve been seeing it for the past two year  it s really friendly and a lot of people are feeding and petting it  including myself  the problem is  the cat bit me randomly  i think it wa a  love bite  since it wa purring during it and it didn t break my skin  there wa no blood or mark  of course i panicked  since then i ve been reading about rabies constantly  also   i went to the doctor  she said that there is no need for rabies vaccine and since i ve had my last tetanus shot le than ten year ago  i also don t need that either  it s been twelve day since that and i ve seen the cat yesterday  it looked normal  wanted to be pet this time i didn t do it  and ate when i fed him  i read that rabid animal die within    day so it sound impossible that the cat had it  i live in a big city and this area is considered free of rabies  there wa no case of rabies in human in my country for more than    year and no case of it in any animal for     even wild one  like fox or wolf  our country had a major project when they vaccinated wild animal and they are still doing it  it sound so logical that i don t have rabies but i can t calm down  i am currently on prozac and xanax and they are not helping me at all  i would be able to go to my psychiatrist next week but i don t know how will i survive till then  litteraly  i am not sleeping  also i m constantly cry and shaking thinking that i will die  what should i do  i really need some help  in these kind of situation i always somehow assume that my case would be the special case and that maybe cat had rabies but the symptom didn t show already  what if the virus wa still in incubation phase  but maybe  just maybe that cat still had it in saliva  i know how ridiculous this sound and i hate myself for this ,anxiety

326,long story short  in my last   year of high school i developed severe panic attack  i had them almost every day  the reason for that wa that i wa bullied by my classmate  and when i had to be with them in one room  e g  a classroom  i got a panic attack because i felt so unsafe with them  i could tell on the second when the panic attack would come  it wa almost a routine  we entered the classroom  everything fine  when the door closed    minute later it started    so although my  original  trigger were my classmate  the panic attack stayed even after high school  whenever i m  locked  in a room space  or have the sensation of not being able to escape when i would want to   i can get a panic attack  they got le frequent over time  but still frequent enough to not be confident enough to think i won t have them when i m in that kind of space    what this story is about  tomorrow is my first driving lesson  i postponed it for year  because i wa just too scared to get a panic attack while driving   i had driving class before  but i quit because i couldn t handle driving while having an actual panic attack  and a not understanding instructor next to me screaming that i had to watch out for this or for that   being in a car just give me so much anxiety that i would rather just not drive  but i need my driver license for practical reason  so i m willing to conquer the fear  but it s getting too much  i m so afraid of getting a panic attack while driving  because it happened before and it s just so awful   do you guy have any idea or thing that could help me not get a panic attack  i wa maybe thinking about medication  but doesn t that affect my driving capability  and can i just go to a gp  explain this situation and hope he prescribes it to me  and if this all work out  how doe medication feel  i ve never been medicated before tbh,anxiety

331,hello  all  so  i ve suffered from gad  sad  depression and bdd for a long time now  in the past few year  i ve started having panic attack  they didn t use to be very common  maybe two occurrence every few month  but now they re solidified a a part of my life  i ve had some very severe one  but the worst i had  by far  wa last night  i m surprised i woke up today  honestly  let me explain  sorry if it s long   normally  my panic attack last around       minute  which is average  i had one a few year ago that lasted an hour  which i helped by jumping into the shower for a while  they normally fade after i do my breathing exercise and create friction on my skin  rubbing my hand together  massaging my palm etc     but last night wa very different    i smoke cannabis  though i hadn t touched it in two day  i wa away for the weekend   when i came back  i had three draw  then stopped because i knew it would be enough  everything wa fine    for around ten minute    then  my heart began pounding  it wa severe  i thought i wa starting to have a heart attack  more minute passed  and i began to have flash and tremble  and my hand  back and chest became coated in sweat  i wa shaking like crazy  laying in bed wasn t helping  so i started moving around my room  which helped a little  i started feeling my symptom fade  but it didn t last long  after a few minute  they all came back  it felt like it wa coming in wave  like  it would ease for a few minute  then come back full force  even worse than before  it made me feel really dizzy and faint    so  i thought the shower trick would surely help   i ran to the bathroom and jumped in for around twenty minute  i just sat at the bottom of the shower  trying to focus on the hot water  normally  this help  and it did for a little while  but it just wasn t cutting it this time  it literally felt like my body wa shutting down    i got out of the shower and stood in the cold for a minute or so  hoping the external sensation would soothe me  it didn t  so i got dressed again  went back into my room  and started pacing  i wa finding it hard to breathe  my chest felt tight  i felt like i wa out of it   i wa dissociating  which made me feel even worse   all of my previous technique just weren t working  so at this point  around an hour and a half in  i wa in a full state of panic  i thought i wa having a stroke or seizure  any stimulation made it worse   i turned my light and tv off  got into bed  under the cover  and clinched onto one of my plushies  i don t know how i managed to fall asleep   i remember counting my breath out loud a i lay on my side  this all happened over the span of     hour  which surely can t be normal    i even started thinking  is my cannabis laced with something  but that would be impossible   i ve had the same bag for a month now  still  no more sativas for me      i have heard of  rolling  panic attack  but that they aren t common  maybe this wa one  ha anyone ever had anything like this before  i wa so frightened  i ve never felt this way before  i feel ok ish today  though drinking coffee certainly didn t help with my anxiety this morning  should i have called an ambulance  i wa very close to  because i ve never had an attack like this  if it wa one ,anxiety
332,had a big realization that helped  i realized for panic or depression caused from external reason like people or thing object  it feel  le bothering if i know that to me it s not a problem but when i include people into it then it feel bothering  let me explain further   if no one existed in this planet and i were the only one  living here and still had this feeling i wouldn t care because i can  handle the feeling since the reason the feeling exist is because other people  or thing        so just tell yourself to you the feeling doesn t bother you unless it s about other people  or thing   you have to not worry about other thing except you  kind ve like constructive selfishness  you will notice the panic depression lower somewhat ,anxiety

348,i m a male in my early   s and and suffer from panic disorder and social anxiety  my first panic attack happened in  th grade  the first time wa more mild and i didn t think much of it  my vision got blurry  i started sweating  and i felt dizzy  i got to the bathroom a fast a i could and i puked my brain out  not very fun but i didn t think i wa dying   the  nd attack wa much worse  i wa mowing the lawn for my grandparent two and a half year later  i started feeling lightheaded and i thought it wa just the heat  i went inside to grab some water and a i got closer to the house i started to get more dizzy and my heart started racing  at this point my vision wa so blurry and my hand were shaking so bad that i almost couldn t even fill a glass with tap water  i drank the whole glass because i thought that it wa heatstroke  after a few more second i knew i had to get to get in bed or risk collapsing in the kitchen  i went to the spare room a fast a i could and curled up in a ball on the bed  everything kept getting worse and by this point i thought it wa a heart attack  i wa too afraid to go downstairs and outside to tell anyone because i knew it wa unlikely but i also didn t know it wa a panic attack  so    i just remember thinking  this is how i ll die  they ll find me dead in this bed and nobody will know what happened to me  including myself  until it s too late   this went on for only a few more second and suddenly it just faded away and left me feeling emotionally and exhausted   i never told anyone about that day until   year later when the panic attack became more frequent and i started having them every     day  at that point i wa diagnosed and put on medication  the med never helped and the therapy sucked too  i learned a couple thing that helped me and decreased the amount of attack to about   or   a month   st let it happen  don t fight the attack  breathing and thinking exercise are okay but don t try and stop them  just try and make yourself comfortable  it s the most uncomfortable thing in the world so just make it more comfortable and they re not a scary  the  nd thing is that you are not crazy  it s just your body dumping adrenaline and panicking because of it  in turn  your body just dump even more adrenaline until a different part of your brain stop it  the point is that it always stop it  even if it didn t you d simply run out of adrenaline and take a hell of a nap later   rd and easiest to do is just try not to hyperventilate  you d be surprised how much hyperventilation cause a lot of the symptom  i don t like counting or holding my breath so i just keep my teeth together and only open my mouth a small amount   if you re on here because you had a panic attack than i m sorry  however  you now are part of a group of people who have seen the pit of hell and lived to tell about it  if it doe happen again you can rest assured that you will wake up tomorrow  you will probably get a fantastic night s sleep after all that energy is gone  and you will get better  have a great day  stay strong and stay smart ,anxiety

451,hi    y male here  this will be a long post because i just want to find some answer about my condition and don t want to leave out anything significant      about   month ago i ended up in the hospital for    day diagnosed with severe rhabdomyolysis  i got it from overexertion while exercising  i thought i could endure it  and i did  mentally but not physically  i ve always been active but i stopped training a year ago   the first symptom after exercising wa numbness in my thigh muscle  then it turned into severe pain and not being able to walk because i couldn t bend my leg without screaming  i went to school   day after the exercise  because i had to correct my grade because it wa the end of the school year    and couldn t take it anymore  i broke down in front of my biology teacher and she reassured me and told me to go home if i m in pain  i stayed for two more class and then left  when i left the school i experienced my first panic attack  dizziness  cry  fast pulse  hyperventilation  but when i saw my mother car when she came to pick me up i immediately calmed down and acted a if i wa okay  at this point i didn t know it wa rhabdo and that i wa in danger  then i came home and saw  blood  in my piss  i googled and saw the    death rate and started praying and cry  then again my parent came home and i told them while being calm that we need to go to the hospital  we went the next day and i wa dispatched into a hospital in another city   hour away from home  i wa on iv fluid      for    day  had to pee into a bottle next to the bed  have my blood drawn regularly    some very traumatic thing i would say  while in the hospital i wasn t very sad  my theory is that i wa suppressing my emotion in front of others for so long that it stopped being an act   all in all  i wa back at home in    day and wa feeling good  i still thought of it all every night    then came summer and this wa the first summer that i spent doing nothing  not working or training   i felt lonely all summer and i didn t even go out with friend  i couldn t wait for school to start  i wasn t really depressed but i wa in a weird phase of not knowing if i m safe to exercise and all that  i felt kind of down and maybe even emotionally numb  i ve been an anxious person all my life and i used to have tremor all the time and  i used to be a stressed person   then school started and i started feeling le anxious and even started going to the gym and going on trip with friend  but then exactly   week ago i noticed on my biology class  right before my presentation  that i started feeling dizzy  shaky  and i couldn t breathe and had a strong and fast pulse  i didn t panic but i wa disoriented and confused  i didn t think much of it  i also felt similarly when my biology teacher  again  talked about kidney and dialysis  i wa in danger of kidney failure because of the illness   i thought mybe it wa ptsd after that i felt   short period of emotional numbness  like   hour of feeling nothing  i understood why people self harm   i then talked to my school psychologist about ptsd and stuff  that thursday i scheduled a meeting with him to talk some more   i should mention that that week and day wa stressful  preparing to travel abroad for a project  almost caught cheating on an exam    after i scheduled the meeting i had biology and then my heart started going     bpm for no reason and started beating rapidly  then i started gradually shaking worse and worse  i couldn t straighten my finger  i wa physically numb and felt pin and needle  i couldn t deep breath  felt something wa stuck in my throat when swallowing  my chest started hurting and i felt so distressed and awful  at first i thought it wa a heart attack  about four minute after it all started i rushed to the psychologist to calm me down  i wa shaking tremendously and i noticed it would stop for    s after i moved and it then started again   it lasted about    minute  he took me to the hospital and a soon a i exited the car my leg stopped shaking  we thought it wa hyperthyroidism because my mom ha it  turn out my blood work wa great and mostly healthy  some hormone slightly elevated but not enough for thyroid disease  i had a temperature      c  about   hour after it and i wa exhausted  at home nothing happened but i wa still distressed physically and my heart rate wa    bpm  the next morning while goin to school i felt my  heart beat and when i got to school i felt it starting again  bpm wa     this time  heart beating rapidly with force  i didn t want to wait for the climax and rushed to the psychologist again  i started shaking again and he calmed me down by making me picture a ball on my body and how it move from one place to another  trying to get my attention off of the situation  it worked  but not for long  when i left the office i started feeling distressed again about    minute after  i used this method that he showed me but it wa so painful and awful trying to hold it in  i didn t want to come to him again because i would have his class in   class  he also teach psychology   when he came  i told him what wa happening and then it happened again while i wa in class  i also felt very cold  i then went to the doctor and she told me to get some more blood test and some examination    that day my pulse wa still high     bpm  and i had a temperature that subsided until the evening  the next few day i wa at home and i felt kind of fine  on monday i went to school and i got out of breath  oh the stair  and felt it almost start to happen again  i then looked through the window and started singing and i successfully stopped it from happening  i ve since felt well in term of stress  i skipped the school project and i didn t go abroad  i didn t have any really stressful situation but i did feel depressed for a day after talking to the psychologist when he told me he doesn t think these are panic attack because i didn t have cold sweat  when i spoke to him my leg started shaking but it stopped and it didn t feel a if it wa a panic attack   i tried to force my panic attack just to show him and myself that it is not something neurological or cognitive  but psychological  it didn t work   what i forgot to mention wa that i have an older brother and sister and they both left for college  brother   year ago  sister   year ago   i miss them but i don t show it  and also about     week ago  my father also left for work and went to my sibling  taking my dog too  they would all come sometimes and when they came i never felt too happy or excited  except for the dog   just passive  i know i miss them very much but i don t show it even to myself  last time they were all here and then left  tear started coming out of my eye and i felt sad  i didn t want to feel that way   also after me talking to the psychologist a week ago and him not really trusting me and believing me i feel like i can cry any moment but tear wont come out  i start making a cry face and my body start doing the weeps but no sound or tear come out  i feel like i m cry all the time  but also never  i can also force it  but the sadness still feel real  it also happens when i think of my panic attack or when i talk about sensitive thing like the emotional numbness and rhabdomyolysis    i m really not sure why i wrote all of this in this post  it is a mess   but i just want to know if these are even good enough reason to develop a panic disorder  i m just so confused and want some answer  do you have to have cold sweat when having a panic attack  what are your thought on this all ,anxiety

456,i need help understanding a concept  when people say saying bad will happen with a panic attack  i know this is supposed to be a way to feel safe  but it doesn t help me    because to me the panic attack is the bad thing  i know i may not actually die  but the attack is real  and when it happens  it traumatizes me  because then i can t leave the house in fear of that attack  happening again   so when they say panic attack aren t harmful or dangerous  this isn t completely true  they are dangerous and harmful to your life  my life is completely ruined from them  how are they not harmful or dangerous  the danger is getting caught in a cycle of severe panic attack  once you get one bad one  then another  and another  and then you end up housebound with no life like me and many other people   how do i understand this concept  that nothing bad will happen during a panic attack  but that s false  a traumatic experience where my body think i m at death door is happening  over and over and over  i am going insane  i can t even sleep at night from an attack during the day    btw if you disagree with me please be nice about it cuz i m extremely vulnerable right now  i m just trying to explain my feeling,anxiety

energy but not nearly enough but it ha some unpleasant side effect like sweating ton like i never have  i also lost weight on that which i didn t mind lol     but because of the side effect  i switched to name brand adderall and then teva  both of which somewhat expand my vocabulary and help me focus a little but do nothing for my energy level and i sleep all day some day  i used to take adderall twice daily   mg each and then switched to    mg once a day after dropping zoloft down to    mg where it s still helping but some instrusive thought have come back again and a month or so ago after dropping down to    mg zoloft  i also started wellbutrin    mg  i take the zoloft and one klonopin at night a well a a      ropinirole for the most brutal thing i m now suffering with because of the setraline and adderall and i had this condition before a well but it s gotten a million time worse on these med to the point where i m truly suffering and that is restless leg syndrome  that combined with how i m always so tired is pure torture  i hate how unproductive i ve become  i also have phisical pain from other condition and a car accident   year ago  i wa an electrician ik construction but i have not been able to work in a couple of year now  i m a family man and a very active father in my kid life a they are my world although it s definitely been tougher the last couple of year  i m trying to find the right combination of these   medication including my hypothyroidism hashimotos but i also am very afraid because of the chance of seizure which i ve never had one but i keep increasing and adding more med and so we will see what happens but i definitely do not want to have a seizure  i also have asthma and ibs and most likely rheumatoid arthritis a well and who know what else  one more thing i ll add is that   hour energy drink used to help me at work when tired some day and so every now and then i will take that a well or some other form of caffeine and i ve ever tried all type of vitamin s a well at time which get expensive when struggling financially  my situation is very complex a you can see  i know the     mg in a caffeine energy shot drink probably increase danger but i am so desperate to feel more energy and sometimes that even make me sleep and other time it give me a slight boost  i also have   special need child out of my   kid and one way worse then the other and he ha the ocd but way worse then i did a a child with the thought etc  and he ha a low iq so it s hard for him to comprehend it and know how to deal with it  i m seeing a new phychiatrist for the first time tonight  the one my   and   year old son s see for adhd etc  and am going to discus this all with him but he s a much much older gentleman and not what he once wa probably but i will see what he say  i wa seeing a psychologist for a while too until recently  i loved this video though and you seem so very knowledgeable so i d love to hear what you would have to say about my very long comment which i apologize for but like i said my situation is very complex unfortunately  i forgot to mention that the caffeine also make the rls much worse and at time even if i m not sleeping  i still can t get up because rubbing my foot together or against the sheet or anything really is addicting because it s the only relief i feel from the rls and so i m still nonproductive even then      the rls is all day nonstop even while moving at time and i will grind my leg and foot so hard into the sheet i will get cut or bruise or even put hole in the sheet  i m not a crazy a it sound here a if you met me   i can definitely have a normal conversation no problem but i m suffering in many way  i almost want to get off of all of it when hopefully soon the magic mushroom become legal in my state a a treatment for anxiety and depression and i ve been reading so much about that and how it help dramatically but without the side effect but it s not legal in my state yet  i am praying you reply because i d love to read or listen and again   i am sorry for writing you a book  thank you ,anxiety

543,hi guy  i m new here    skip to the bottom of you don t want a wall of contex   i didn t know this subreddit existed until just now but i m glad it doe a it give me comfort knowing i m not the only one with this problem  nobody i know seems to know what panic attack even are and even laugh at me for it a if it s just a joke lol   anyway i just wanted to share my experience  i ve been reading about panic attack a lot recently and find it help knowing that people can come out of the other side of an attack absolutely fine   so  for year i ve had attack at a frequency of around     a year   my first attack i discovered stemmed from drinking far too much coffee  it wa only by chance while listening to a podcast a few day after having a really bad attack  that drinking stupid amount of coffee doesn t help  since then  lowering my coffee intake ha made a noticeable difference   my issue with some attack also stemmed from thinking about stupid thing whilst i m trying to sleep  for example  i would somehow start thinking about death and what it would be like to be dead and the whole thought of not existing ha caused me multiple panic attack over the year  i have nearly broken this cycle entirely by listening to audiobooks while i try and sleep  this take my mind off thing and i get to listen to a good book  so win  win right   however  even after stopping my   biggest reason to panic attack  i have had   episode over the past month which have me concerned because i can t see a reason for them starting at all   my first one this month wa at work  i wa working very hard physically  more than i usually do  i came to a stop to check my work and had a very small episode  i thought i wa going to have a heart attack and instantly started coughing   i read or saw that coughing can help whilst having a heart attack   i sat down after that and stupidly didn t tell anyone at work through fear of looking weak  after taking it easy for the rest of the day  the symptom dissapeared completely  all in all  it wa a sudden but short lived attack thankfully   about   hour ago i just had my worst attack ever  i just woke up from having a nap  went to sit on the couch to watch tv with my wife and then all of a sudden  my face went super hot  i started panicking and said to my wife  i m having a panic attack   she went into panic mode herself  and tried to calm me down and got me some eucalyptus oil to smell to take my mind off it  however  this attack just spiraled out of control and i practically begged her to phone an ambulance which she did  i really did think i wa going to die right there in my house  heart beating out my check  nausea  the feeling of impending doom   this attack wa the first time it s actually caused me to be sick and i wa shakingg really bad with im guessing adrenaline   after i tried to be sick  i felt better enough that i took the phone from wife who wa talking to     and i said not to come here because i ve calmed down and got it more under control   at this point i wa kinda stuck with my head in the toilet  unsure whether to be sick  but whenever i stood up  the attack would start getting worse so i stayed on the floor   i then just burst out cry because i wanted to see my dad who just got back off holiday and it almost felt a if i needed to see him before i died or something  i don t know quite how to explain it   either way  he came over and talked a if nothing serious is happening it s just another visit to my house  it almost sound like he didn t care but  that normality eventually bought me out of the attack and we just ended up drinking tea and having a chat and before you know it  the symptom dissapeared   i haven t had a look around this subreddit much  but i m just wondering if it s common for everyone to have the feeling of impending doom   it s really hard to describe such a feeling to someone that hasnt experienced an attack  people say they feel like they were gonna die all the time from simple thing like a bad hangover and it s almost impossible to describe to them or convince them that the feeling is the real deal during an attack   after googling a lot of info that state attack are generally not serious  i m still      sure that if my wife wasn t there with me  i wouldn t have been able to stop it getting worse until something serious happened  i m intrigued a to what would actually happen at that point  would i faint  have a heart attack   at the time of an attack i m sure it s going to lead to something serious if i don t stop it  which lead to further panicking and i m not convinced while i m having an attack that it won t be serious if it doesn t stop   either way  that s my story  i ll be lurking around here regularly looking for any useful information and hope someone can get something out of my experience ,anxiety

596,  f  a few month ago i felt around my vagina and found a weird bump to the right about an inch or le in  almost seems like a chunk of skin i could grab  i dont think it grown and it not really big but i dont feel much of it on the other side  ive noticed that friction hurt it  sex is a bit achy there and especially achy pain when fingered  i used to have sex all the time zero issue and i went   year no sex and now it doesnt feel the same the area is sore when rubbed too much  the first dr i went to said it wa skin and the second dr i went to told me it could be a polyp  ive been referred to a gyno a few time now and keep getting declined  ive had bloodwork  pelvic  transvaginal ultrasound  sti test all fine  im so scared what could it be  ,anxiety
597,so i ve noticed a weird symptom that happens sometimes when i m coming down from a panic attack  i ll basically go from high alert panic mode to being fully asleep without even noticing i wa falling asleep at all  for me  this usually look like me playing relaxing puzzle game on my phone  trying to calm myself down even a little  and then next thing i know i m woken up by my phone buzzing  it s really disorienting because i pretty much have no warning for falling asleep  plus just moment before i wa in the midst of a panic attack  ie  sleep seemed like an impossible thing for my body to do in that moment    i ve also experienced this phenomenon with intense anger before  but not in a long time  one would assume sadness and cry would have the same effect but surprisingly that s not the case  i ve only had these sleep attack when i m extremely scared or extremely angry  i   briefly   researched narcolepsy and cataplexy  but neither one sound like what i m experiencing  i m not  super  worried  because i m at home all the time and i can get myself safely to a bed if i m worried about basically passing out  which ha never happened by the way   but i have to admit it s a little scary to find out your body just shut itself down without warning like that   also  a a point of reference  i ve dealt with panic attack since i wa    but they ve gotten significantly worse in the past couple year  at this point  i don t know what symptom are just normal panic attack thing and what symptom are specific to me because i ve experienced near constant long term panic   doe anyone know what might be happening to me  and ha anyone else dealt with the same thing ,anxiety
598,when im in the middle of an attack  the one thing that brings me back is the thought that i can go to a hospital  just the fact that i know if it get too bad  i can go to the hospital and they will give me something to relieve me of panic  it kind of a way out to bring me back to reality and realize that this isnt forever  just wondering if anyone else had a coping thought or anything like that ,anxiety
