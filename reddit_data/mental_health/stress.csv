0,"hey there :) so i (m, 32) wa wondering if i am all alone or someone else can relate: whenever feeling reaaallyy stressed or anxious or overwhelmed, wearing drynites/teen diaper relief my stress.
i am not into abdl or something sexually about it - it just lower my stress level and make me feel comfortable and protected. it all started when i (because of stress) wet the bed and then wore drynites for a couple of day just for protecting the mattress - and somehow recognised the protected feeling and stress relieve i get from having these on. i now feel really ashamed of myself and these thought and feeling :/ can anyone relate? or am i totally weird and somehow psychological sick or something? i would really love to hear your opinion on that!

best wishes

and that's not factoring in the handful of deeply personal shit thats happened that i'm not going to blast all over the internet.

i'm seeing a therapist. i'm not on medication because it scare me, and my psychiatrist agreed that it wasn't for the best, at least right now.

i've developed fun little heart palpitations. they're terrifying.

i'm wondering if im under such a high level of stress all the time that it's begun to just feel normal. like i dont know what to do to ""calm down and relieve stress"" because to me, a good day is a day where i avoid a breakdown.

hey! ok, i ask you to read below and try to put yourself in my situation.

2021-04-13:
long story short. had been suffering from a long-lasting cough (5-6 weeks) and sought care. the doctor heard something on the left lung and sent me for an urgent x-ray the same day.  i wa terrified and thought i had lung cancer.  i wa nervous and scared to death until i got my test result back.  it showed nothing but i recovered a few day later.

2021-09-14:
my wife found a liver spot/mole on my back that looked weird. this after i had complained of itching in that place 1-2 month earlier. thought it wa skin cancer and wa nervous and scared to death for several week before i received an answer that there wa no danger. the mole didn't look ""bad"" so they didn't do anything about it.

2021-10-07:
my wife find a lump on the right shoulder blade, size approx. 1x1 cm. it can be moved but feel strange somehow.  immediately becomes completely convinced that this is also a cancerous tumor.  either the skin cancer ha spread or it is a sarcoma (soft tissue cancer that can feel exactly like a fatty lump). once again, i became very nervous, stressed and scared to death. i sought care and wa able to see a reputable doctor who informed me that it wa a lipoma. when he wa about to take it away, he say he can't find it.  i imagined he saw it and it wasn't a lipoma.  he said something to the other doctor and i didn't really understand where.  he you catch me again and the lump is still there.  instead, he sends me for an urgent mr x-ray and here i am completely destroyed.  i take him a if he ha seen something that make him not dare to cut me.  i lie at home and shake for several day and have such fear of death that it is completely sick. i end up trying to go into that x-ray tunnel but it doesn't work. try 3-4 time but i just lie there and cry because i'm afraid of what the x-ray will show.  here i am completely convinced that it is cancer of some kind.  i had to cancel everything and today the lump is still there.  the doctor called me 3 week later and said he wa 100% sure it wa a lipoma and that it can stay on my body without doing any harm. so, i still have it and i'm alive.

during this course of ""diseases"" i get hemorrhoid and start having stomach problems.  i still have huge problem with my stomach (heartburn, acid regurgitation, irregular stools, stomach pain, stomach cramps, etc.).

i'm simply wondering if this could be the result of some kind of stress, nervousness, panic disorder, death anxiety over an extended period of time?

note: i have never before had ""problems"" with my stomach (that i know of) but after the above event it is in total revolt.

please write a line or two what you think.

sorry for a long post, but it's important and nice for me to write a little.

on friday, i went through a highly stressful event, and endured lot of stress, build up of hormone etc. this acute stress i went through, benefited me! the next day i felt energetic, happy, and overall in good shape. heck, even my short term memory improved! i started remembering thing much more clearly and openly. i learnt a lot that day, and wa really surprised by my performance.



the next day, another stressful event occurred.. an acute one aswell. this wa *not* pleasant, at all. endured lot of stress, build up of hormones.. etc :/ why doe this happen to me?


unfortunately, a you'd expect..my situation went downhill *fast*. i started forgetting things, winded up in a depressed mood..found 0 interest in thing i enjoyed.. etc..my memory also became worse. :(


(i also experienced a horrible nightmare today too, and slept 12 hours, which is completely abnormal).


so now that i've hid this up in my mind for 1 day, i'd like to speak out. i need answers. what is happening here? what happened to me and my brain? will i ever recover/be happy and will my memory improve like that last time? please help. i'm leaving this all on you reddit...",stress

im 21 year old and im already feeling burnt out and ready to give up. i work a full time job and go to school part time. i just moved out of my parent house 2 month ago and got an apartment with my boyfriend. i get stuck doing majority of the housework like laundry, dishes, cleaning, and grocery shopping. my dad work all day long and my mom doesnt drive so im constantly driving my mom and my younger sibling every where.

i work 6:30am-3pm and i usually dont even get to sit and relax until 7pm, then im going to bed by 8pm but im not falling asleep until midnight and im up on and off all throughout the night.

im barely making enough money to pay my bills, and im also the family bank to my mom and dad. dont get me wrong i dont mind helping them out but theyre constantly asking to borrow money and 9 time out of 10 i dont get it back.

its miraculous i didnt hit my head. in fact it kind of puzzle me, but i wa blacked out drunk (working on recovery now).

it dawned on me that maybe my existence for the past 2 month ha been in a coma. that im in a hospital bed on life support; surrounded by family; experience with family are my mind manifesting their conversation they have around me.

89,"it take more to overwhelm some people than others, but the feeling and the impact are the same: overload and not knowing which way to turn next which trigger a downward spiral of anxiety.

### take these step to create a plan and go from feeling overwhelmed to feeling peaceful again:

**identify what you can and cant control.** list your issue in three columns: what you can control, what you can influence and what is out-with your control.

**focus on solutions.** now that you have perspective on what you can and cant control, identify your chosen end point for each issue. shift your focus from the problem to the solutions.

**prioritise your actions.** consider your chosen solution in term of how important they are and how urgent they are. firstly, deal with the issue that are both important and urgent then move to the other important issues. a a general rule, deal with the important issue over the urgent issues: here-in lie the path to living sustainably crisis free.

**communicate.** with your plan in place, communicate with those who may be affected: it incredible how supportive people can be once they understand your situation.

**eat well.** overwhelm commonly lead to skipping meal or over-reliance on junk food. buy in some healthy food and snack to give you the nutrition youll need to play your best game.

**gratitude.** it is easy to lose sight of the good thing happening when we feel overwhelmed. adopt the habit of regularly reflecting on the thing youre grateful for: that youre taking control of challenging situations, that youre on your way to calmer times, that youre learning a lot about yourself, perhaps that others are supporting you.

**blow off some steam.** exercise  whatever work best for you: a brisk walk, hit the weights, an hour on the bike  ha a magical ability to burn off that anxiety and re-set all those neurotransmitters. it will also help you get that good night sleep.

**get your rest.** know that youre focusing on your priority with a clear plan. youre pushing yourself hard through the day. a good night sleep is the smartest thing you can give yourself to keep working through your list.

**celebrate your successes.** each step forward is worthy of celebration. be proud of yourself for taking control and moving forward. each success lead to further step forward.


**overwhelm is a situation everyone is familiar with. short term episode are unlikely to harm us. longer term however, it can be debilitating. remember there is help out there for those time you need support in getting back on top of things.**",stress

106,"i know life is supposed to be difficult. i know stressful thing can happen, and that most of u learn how to cope in a healthy way. eating right and exercising are supposed to make u healthy and happy, both physically and mentally. we're supposed to have hobby (beginner at knitting) to keep u occupied and to do our duties, which manifest in the job that i do almost every day. we need to have a network of support from friend and family. life isn't just what happens to you, it's how you react to it. that's what i tell myself.

yet it seems that life, or at least my life, is just one stressful event after another. be it getting rear-ended and struggling with insurance for a few months, a single parent's boyfriend showing up who stress you out for the next few, transferring from one branch to another in your job, looming deadlines, and the knowledge that you have to eat healthily and sleep at least 8 hour a night or you're going to get sick...etc. etc. etc. many time i'm happy and i catch myself wondering when the next bad thing is going to happen. without fail, it does. i deal with it successfully, and it's on to the next one! over and over and over again, catching moment of pleasure and peace in between. it's not a very good comparison, but it's kind of like dark souls, where you die your way through instead of playing your way through.

i'm slowly being chipped away at. i've built an extraordinarily healthy way of living, but it seems at this point that it's just a tower i've built over a foundation under continuous assault by the element that i'm constantly repairing.

i've been tired. so tired. it's like i died a long time ago, and i'm only 23. i know everybody deal with constant stressors, so is everyone secretly feeling this way? is it all drowned in alcohol? drugs? religion? are we supposed to naturally numb ourselves with age? this can't be all that life is!

my grandfather eats junk food. he stand or sits around for most of the day and sometimes he go for a walk before coming home and eating. he's been through the vietnam war and lost almost everything. despite sleep apnea, cancer, a fat-rich diet, and falling once, he's still thriving in his eighties. no one get to that point unless they've got it all figured out inside.

there's something obvious i'm missing, something that appears to make all the difference. i don't think a girlfriend will fix this, nor will any big purchase or materialism. ideally, i'd have a life of inner peace and contentment, filled with steady but peaceful determination. otherwise, life ha no meaning to it.",stress

i had been working in a shitty workplace. the pay ain't bad but to deal with my bos terrible management and temperament which make his employee turnover rate is so high .people would stay around for a week up to 3-4 months, with the group chat kept having people leave and join. a of now there are around 15 people who have come and gone which i seen since the first day i joined and worked here up until now. i heard that this business ha been running for 4-5 year now but from what i seen is almost like an enterprenuerial business with no idea and direction they wanted to do a they have tutoring, selling board games/blind box and even large figurine tradings, throwing menial task at every employee with focus on trying to get more employee to join. i worked around 11-12 hour on average so it make me stressed at first.

then a few day ago when i got home from work (around 11pm almost midnight) my dad called me in to have a talk with him, then he explains that he's worried about my health and my body health. at first i didn't think about it much. me and my father didn't go well for a long time so i think of it more a of a warning, however it turned to make me angry and stressed a he simulate what will happen to me by imagining if i were turned into a disabled person and unable to move at all, with me still able to talk. i got so stressed and tired enough that i didn't get enough sleep after i finally got to excuse myself.

and come up to today a i had enough with today a i tend after their store and i wa a little loopy, i looked like i wa sleeping when i'm actually trying to stay awake. the owner called me that he's been watching me sleeping for 15 minute and he's going to cut my pay. then he ordered me to go to wash my face. i did before coming back, so angry and annoyed that i slapped the store's security camera, hard. luckily it didn't break just the camera cable disconnected so it's an easy fix. so i just called the manager and told them that the camera accidentally fell to the ground and broke, saying that it worked fine after i reassembled it. i wa a little panicked but a little le stressful from that.

one reason is that food is my 'happy place': whenever i have stress due to my education at uni, or my work schedule or my failing dating and social life, i can eat food and feel better.  i frequently describe it a one of the highlight of my day. anyhow, on another sub people adviced me to see my problem losing weight in the amount i want, not really a a problem of losing weight but one of reducing stress. so that's what i do.

i tried a lot already to reduce stress: going to the gym, not working at nights, try to communicate with someone before embarking on over-ambitious projects, spending le time on my education and trying to stay at home more often to avoid having to travel a lot. still, here i am.  would you have any advice or experience that could help me improve my stress management techniques?",stress

i wa never very good at asking woman out even though most of my life i wa told i wa extremely handsome im tall 61 blonde hair , brown eye . i wa told i could have modeled when i wa younger . anyway i didnt lose my virginity till i wa 20 which is late but partly because i wa shy , just not confident. i had an opportunity to be that girl boyfriend who i lost my virginity to but i just decided i didnt want a relationship with her , well between 2007 and 2009 i had no heterosexual sex but desired it but wa insecure, etc . ill admit because i grew up in san francisco and had gay friend i even experimented with gay men a a way out since i wa just not having relationship with woman but i realized obviously i wa not gay or bi since i didnt feel attracted to men . than im 2010 i had sex with a drunk cougar and that wa one and done . i had a disasterous date with a woman in the mission district in sf and it wa horrible. i than tried going to  cougar bar with my friend but of course we would never go home with anyone, and it wasnt my scene anyway. than in 2012 i met my first girlfriend who wa older than me at a class. funny thing is i liked her immediately and she clearly liked me . we saw the batman dark knight movie which wa our first date in 2012. well we fucked like crazy so much so that i felt it wa a bit much and the non sexual side of our relationship seemed kinda ehhh.
well i eventually drove her away and regretted it . and since then ive slept with a few older woman from 2015-2019. but since covid ive had no sex except masturbation . partly i still do struggle with being insecure and feeling like woman will never be into me which i know is nonsense of course . but i am now have a strange sense of being torn on one hand i would like to be in a relationship, on the other hand my life is busy enough with work and exploring stuff in la with my camera . i almost feel like the woman would have to be perfect for me because i feel like maybe my earlier history told me something that im just someone who lost their virginity late and because of it maybe it messed me up or maybe im better off just with a few friend and my own life . partly i think i need someone who i can be myself around them without judgment and im trying to change . maybe im just to weird or absent minded . i try to work on my confidence and i try to
fake it till i make it but that can only last so long . i do have confidence issue and while im secretive about it deep inside i feel like most woman are either judging me or think im unattractive , or that im gay.

i guess i need to work on myself . i want to get back into shape , eat healthier, exercise like i used to . also i use to shave everyday clean shaven and short hair but when covid came i got lazy. im going to try and get myself together and work on myself. i take my medication for depression which help and i do have a therapist but i cant see her a much a id like . i do have challenge but i always try to work through them

my issue with sex, relationships, asking woman out :
i have often had issue with asking woman out , etc. it weird maybe i am incel yet i dont blame my problem on woman i blame it all on myself that im my own worst enemy. i tend to shoot myself in the foot . it weird because i dont consider myself repressed. i grew up in a liberal household in san francisco. i also am not a right winger a most incels are . i am liberal . anyways so most men can ask a woman out with no problem and nothing would faze them . i on the other hand have trouble because i dont want to make a fool of myself, come off a creepy etc . good example is there is this customer at work who i like and come in most everyday . her and i talk quite a bit when im helping her and we smile at each other . and i think she like me , but probably just being friendly. two of my colleague know i like her and always ask  have you asked her out yet  i always give an excuse or that she wouldnt want to have anything to do with me that way.  so other guy could just ask a woman out with no issue but not me. also im not at my best right now and want to get back to being healthy and exercise. the funny thing is i can talk to beautiful woman because i do every day because i work in beverly hill and i can engage and be friendly but on my own i dont seek out to talk to woman because of my own fear a how they view me. the funny thing is i did ask my ex gf out but it wasnt really a date asking her out it wa more casual and thing developed. i just wonder if i can overcome these issue that have been plaguing me for a good chunk of my life . i just sometimes feel im cursed .h",stress

she told this confused bloke that had only been there for a week to show me around, this guy had no clue what he wa doing tbh, just pointed at thing and told me i had to empty bin that way. later i wa then told i had to drive around this fucking monster of a cleaning machine in tight rooms, never had proper training on this thing btw just got told what button to press and to just practice. yeah sure ill just practice not crashing a giant machine into stack of metal cage whilst also dodging death. i have crashed this machine not badly luckily but have definitely been in situation that couldve killed me. the thing that really pissed me off is the fact i wa struggling on driving this thing today, the supervisor who wa meant to be helping me, didnt want to help me (laughed and shyed away) when i wa panicking on the machine co i couldnt get it through this gap and i didnt want to crash into big metal box that couldve fell on me. she got on it and started getting nervous herself being on it and hated driving it just a much a i do, then started mocking how i have to drive it and she doesnt. keep in mind shes meant to have fucking trained me to use it.

**how mindfulness replaces medication to reduce anxiety**

a care contemplation course might be a successful at lessening uneasiness a a typical medicine, a per another review.

the exploration, distributed on november 9 in jama psychiatry, involved a gathering of 276 grown-ups with untreated uneasiness problems. a big part of the patient wa haphazardly chosen to take 10 to 20 mg of escitalopram, the nonexclusive type of lexapro, a typical medicine used to treat nervousness and wretchedness. the other half were relegated to an eight-week course in care-based pressure decrease.

the outcome were dazzling: the two gathering experienced about a 20% decrease in their tension side effect over the eight-week time span.

elizabeth hoge, the lead creator on the review and the overseer of the tension issue exploration program at georgetown college clinical center, let cnn know that she trust the examination can open up greater treatment choice for patient with uneasiness.

its extremely stressful to meet different child and teacher every day. i have to keep an eye on the child all day, tell them off if theyre misbehaving, sometimes even break up fight between them. some of the older (8-9) child can be very difficult and even mean to me.

everything about this stress me out. and i dont even have to work every day, if i make myself unavailable i dont get asked to work. but i try to work a much a possible because i need money (im living at my parent house at the moment though, so no bills).

155,"my father always made sure to use me to get money or to save money, whether it wa by collecting my school certificate to collect the tuition bonus granted by his work, by declaring me on his tax so a not to paying or stealing the money that wa in my bank account and passbook shortly before i turned 18 (he never mentioned it, a if it had never happened). unfortunately, since 2020, i have been stuck at his house, although i spend almost every day at my mother's house, but unofficially, he doe not know.

since last year, with the diagnosis of my autism, the problem of this kind have resumed. he especially wanted to fill in the application form for an allowance from the mdph (a structure granting aid to people with disabilities), which seemed suspicious to me, because he never bother with something that is not for him if he doesn't have an interest. for a long time, nothing happened, since the processing of the file is very long. after a few months, he wanted to know the status of the file and wa told that it would be processed in the coming months.

in september, the situation began to change, but not in a positive way. an employee of the mdph who deal with request for assistance related to employment called me on my cell phone, but i could not answer. what i didn't anticipate wa that she would call my father's home phone the next minute, he had added his number to my file when he completed it and i hadn't considered that possibility. a few moment after finishing the call, he came over to explain what had happened and to ask me to come into the living room to call her back, speakerphone on, him sitting next to me. once the call wa over, which wa of minor importance, he told me in a rather unhealthy way that he wanted to be kept informed of any development regarding the case. two day later, he announced his interest in the story. he wanted to use the pretext of helping to pay the rent to get some of the money back from the allowance. am i surprised? not at all. especially since this pretext is false, because he finished paying his loan, he doe not pay any rent, my mother confirmed it to me.

from this period, i decided to recover a duplicate of the key to the mailbox, since he had never given it to me, and to monitor any arrival of mail in my name to prevent him from recovers. this wa useful, because at different time i wa able to get a letter from the mdph with my credentials, a letter from a bank concerning a passbook which had not been used for year (and which he had robbed before my 18 years) a well a the most precious letter from the mdph which confirmed the validation of my request for allowance. since that moment, i break my head trying to check the mailbox before him, but his departure are very random and unpredictable, so i do not succeed every time.

my father ha always hijacked my mail, opened it to read it and handed it to me at his convenience, which can cause me problem if he hide important mail from me. this almost happened with my first tax return that i had to do myself this year, he had hidden the mail (is it any wonder since he couldn't use me to protect himself from the tax anymore?) and if i hadn't been curious enough to go through his messy paperwork (he doesn't know the concept of tidying up), i could have been in serious trouble.

as if that wasn't bad enough, about halfway through the year, a government department sent me a letter to notify me that i had received assistance from a job search support structure. of course, a with other letter to me, he opened it and read it. within minutes, he decided that my letter to my mother's house should be sent to him. since he wa a mailman before he retired a few week earlier, he took advantage of the fact that i wa in another room to call one of his friend and ask him to divert my mail with my mother's address to his mailbox, except that i heard everything.

as for the aid from the mdph, event resumed last week. my father expressed his astonishment that there had been no response from the mdph almost a year after receiving the request, without knowing that not only did i have identifier to follow the status of my file on their site since last year, but that in addition i had secretly retrieved my letter from his mailbox. he then said that we would see what happens at the start of the year, i thought i wa calm. it wa without counting on the subject with which he then continued. the bank. since december, he ha insisted with this point for different reasons. in december, it wa to ask me insistently if i wanted to keep my current bank account or change and use the one of another bank which i thought deleted for year and which i rediscovered in 2020. later in the year, he said several time that he would have to make an appointment with an adviser from the nearby bank branch, whom he seemed to know well, to check whether my mother had power of attorney on my account, created for security after my 18, and withdraw them if that wa the case, implying that she might steal my money, which just go to show how sassy he is. he spoke several time about also making a request to obtain my identifier so that i could have an eye on my account on the internet. last week, he brought it up again, adding that it would allow him to verify and control my account, a if it were normal.

the sequel, this week, could not have gone worse. from the start, he asked me to be present to call the mdph to find out the status of my benefit application. i pretended to have a medical appointment to leave very quickly, he ordered me to come back after this one to make the call, but i actually went to my mother's house, a often, but also to warn her of the evolution of the situation. after an hour, he bombarded me with call for almost three hours, then ended up leaving a message, ordering me to call him back and threatening to leave me locked out, with the key in the lock. , if i did not hurry to telephone. i had to lie to him by making him believe that i had been taken care of very late and that i had forgotten to come back, which wa difficult to pass, then i got some news which i consider to be very serious, he had finally contacted the mdph in my absence and had been given personal information such a the status of my file without my consent.

the next day, increasing the seriousness of the situation, he had informed me that he wanted to contact the caf (an organization that allocates various social and family benefits) a soon a possible to obtain a new code to access my caf account in order to monitor it. he had no idea that i had been using it for some time. i thought i could avoid this by doing what i had to do in my room during the day, but shortly after the organization's closing time, he burst into my room to ask me for confirmation of my phone number without saying why. second later, i received a text message with a confirmation code that he wanted to see and used. it wa only after he had finished his manipulation that he told me he had succeeded in changing my password and wa able to access my account.

the more time passes, the more intrusive he becomes. since the call in september, he ha turned his attention back to my application for an allowance and since last week, he seems to be redoubling his effort to try to get the money i am going to receive. he doesn't know that the letter from the caf that he had hidden at the beginning of last month wa the continuation of my application for the allowance, because he didn't know about it at the time, and he hasn't noticed that i got it back yet. i don't know how long this will last.

the turn of event is bothering me and i am in a situation where no solution is perfect. there is in my father, he ha an angry character, especially when thing don't go his way and he ha a demeanor and a humor that could be qualified a redneck, but where at least i can take the time to do what i want to do, especially when he is not present. there is my mother's house, she ha a terrible bad temper and communication is very complicated with her, she is unfortunately also unpleasant to make demeaning comment from time to time, certainly, she doe not have the malevolence or the deceit of my father, but it is difficult to bear and it is difficult for me to organize myself for certain things, because she considers in a somewhat excessive way that she exercise the rule that she want at home, which can create annoyance in some cases, for example i could not use my own computer a i wished and only if she agreed. however, she is the only one who care a little about me, despite her character.

despite all these inconveniences, i have recently started to organize my departure preparations, but discreetly, my father doe not know anything about it. unfortunately, there is no place where i feel comfortable.

as much a i try to move forward, everything complicates my task, especially him, and the situation get worse. i still have no hope of being able to leave and finally have a place where i would be comfortable.",stress

hey! ok, i ask you to read below and try to put yourself in my situation.

long story short. had been suffering from a long-lasting cough (5-6 weeks) and sought care. the doctor heard something on the left lung and sent me for an urgent x-ray the same day.  i wa terrified and thought i had lung cancer.  i wa nervous and scared to death until i got my test result back.  it showed nothing but i recovered a few day later.

2021-09-14:
my wife found a liver spot/mole on my back that looked weird. this after i had complained of itching in that place 1-2 month earlier. thought it wa skin cancer and wa nervous and scared to death for several week before i received an answer that there wa no danger. the mole didn't look ""bad"" so they didn't do anything about it.

2021-10-07:
my wife find a lump on the right shoulder blade, size approx. 1x1 cm. it can be moved but feel strange somehow.  immediately becomes completely convinced that this is also a cancerous tumor.  either the skin cancer ha spread or it is a sarcoma (soft tissue cancer that can feel exactly like a fatty lump). once again, i became very nervous, stressed and scared to death. i sought care and wa able to see a reputable doctor who informed me that it wa a lipoma. when he wa about to take it away, he say he can't find it.  i imagined he saw it and it wasn't a lipoma.  he said something to the other doctor and i didn't really understand where.  he you catch me again and the lump is still there.  instead, he sends me for an urgent mr x-ray and here i am completely destroyed.  i take him a if he ha seen something that make him not dare to cut me.  i lie at home and shake for several day and have such fear of death that it is completely sick. i end up trying to go into that x-ray tunnel but it doesn't work. try 3-4 time but i just lie there and cry because i'm afraid of what the x-ray will show.  here i am completely convinced that it is cancer of some kind.  i had to cancel everything and today the lump is still there.  the doctor called me 3 week later and said he wa 100% sure it wa a lipoma and that it can stay on my body without doing any harm. so, i still have it and i'm alive.

during this course of ""diseases"" i get hemorrhoid and start having stomach problems.  i still have huge problem with my stomach (heartburn, acid regurgitation, irregular stools, stomach pain, stomach cramps, etc.).

i'm simply wondering if this could be the result of some kind of stress, nervousness, panic disorder, death anxiety over an extended period of time?

note: i have never before had ""problems"" with my stomach (that i know of) but after the above event it is in total revolt.

please write a line or two what you think.

on friday, i went through a highly stressful event, and endured lot of stress, build up of hormone etc. this acute stress i went through, benefited me! the next day i felt energetic, happy, and overall in good shape. heck, even my short term memory improved! i started remembering thing much more clearly and openly. i learnt a lot that day, and wa really surprised by my performance.



the next day, another stressful event occurred.. an acute one aswell. this wa *not* pleasant, at all. endured lot of stress, build up of hormones.. etc :/ why doe this happen to me?


unfortunately, a you'd expect..my situation went downhill *fast*. i started forgetting things, winded up in a depressed mood..found 0 interest in thing i enjoyed.. etc..my memory also became worse. :(


(i also experienced a horrible nightmare today too, and slept 12 hours, which is completely abnormal).


so now that i've hid this up in my mind for 1 day, i'd like to speak out. i need answers. what is happening here? what happened to me and my brain? will i ever recover/be happy and will my memory improve like that last time? please help. i'm leaving this all on you reddit...",stress

54,"ive been struggling recently with stress and anxiety about life in general. im having constant headache and migraines, im not sleeping well, im overeating

im 21 year old and im already feeling burnt out and ready to give up. i work a full time job and go to school part time. i just moved out of my parent house 2 month ago and got an apartment with my boyfriend. i get stuck doing majority of the housework like laundry, dishes, cleaning, and grocery shopping. my dad work all day long and my mom doesnt drive so im constantly driving my mom and my younger sibling every where.

i work 6:30am-3pm and i usually dont even get to sit and relax until 7pm, then im going to bed by 8pm but im not falling asleep until midnight and im up on and off all throughout the night.

im barely making enough money to pay my bills, and im also the family bank to my mom and dad. dont get me wrong i dont mind helping them out but theyre constantly asking to borrow money and 9 time out of 10 i dont get it back.

im just so tired and sick of everyone laying their shit on me but then not being able to ask anyone for help.",stress

55,"2 month ago i had a terrible fall resulting in a broken shoulder that hopefully will make a full recovery. nerve is bruised so it a fairly useless arm at the moment.

life ha been strange being off work and at home. i cant drive for now. family ha been visiting and helping drive me around for errand and appointments. most friend are settling down with a family, have moved, or are career focused etc. so i havent seen anyone except a best friend. everything else ha been distant communication like the odd text here and there (when it external of family and the best friend, that is).

its miraculous i didnt hit my head. in fact it kind of puzzle me, but i wa blacked out drunk (working on recovery now).

it dawned on me that maybe my existence for the past 2 month ha been in a coma. that im in a hospital bed on life support; surrounded by family; experience with family are my mind manifesting their conversation they have around me.

everything is just a manifestation of my mind but im actually in a coma.

im weirded out and there are several trigger that cause me to second guess myself.

edit: some of the trigger i mean include that grocery is symbolism for nutrients/iv time, my parent visiting in life are just visiting me in a hospital, friend who i no longer speak with recently have actually said their good byes; an ex lover i always thought about getting back together with finally blocked me out after 4 year - i got disconnected.

right now my friend and family are gone, family is on a trip at the moment. that may be symbolism that they too, have left. for now or ever im unsure.

i recently started talking a lot more with one of my brother - but were talking about old video game and nostalgia. everything i know about him in the present ha sort of been static.

thats one way to say it. thing appear to progress but it turn out to be static; no change happened that wa perceived to be",stress

61,"it take more to overwhelm some people than others, but the feeling and the impact are the same: overload and not knowing which way to turn next which trigger a downward spiral of anxiety.

### take these step to create a plan and go from feeling overwhelmed to feeling peaceful again:

**identify what you can and cant control.** list your issue in three columns: what you can control, what you can influence and what is out-with your control.

**focus on solutions.** now that you have perspective on what you can and cant control, identify your chosen end point for each issue. shift your focus from the problem to the solutions.

**prioritise your actions.** consider your chosen solution in term of how important they are and how urgent they are. firstly, deal with the issue that are both important and urgent then move to the other important issues. a a general rule, deal with the important issue over the urgent issues: here-in lie the path to living sustainably crisis free.

**communicate.** with your plan in place, communicate with those who may be affected: it incredible how supportive people can be once they understand your situation.

**eat well.** overwhelm commonly lead to skipping meal or over-reliance on junk food. buy in some healthy food and snack to give you the nutrition youll need to play your best game.

**gratitude.** it is easy to lose sight of the good thing happening when we feel overwhelmed. adopt the habit of regularly reflecting on the thing youre grateful for: that youre taking control of challenging situations, that youre on your way to calmer times, that youre learning a lot about yourself, perhaps that others are supporting you.

**blow off some steam.** exercise  whatever work best for you: a brisk walk, hit the weights, an hour on the bike  ha a magical ability to burn off that anxiety and re-set all those neurotransmitters. it will also help you get that good night sleep.

**get your rest.** know that youre focusing on your priority with a clear plan. youre pushing yourself hard through the day. a good night sleep is the smartest thing you can give yourself to keep working through your list.

**celebrate your successes.** each step forward is worthy of celebration. be proud of yourself for taking control and moving forward. each success lead to further step forward.


**overwhelm is a situation everyone is familiar with. short term episode are unlikely to harm us. longer term however, it can be debilitating. remember there is help out there for those time you need support in getting back on top of things.**",stress

62,"i wonder how a person reacts at suddenly wake up by get mad and angry for unreasonable thing from a person. thing that not making sense to be mad about. a narcissistic person that not going to tolerate with whatever you say and do.

63,"when i get stressed from losing stuff, thing not going my way which should(like my stuff, someone moving it, not life, that shi hard) and stuff that just freak me out. i had a game that i played for a while called one piece bounty rush, i know a stupid anime game. for me i wa in love with it. i had hour in it and spent a decent amount of money. a you know get bored delete and redownload. before anyone say i did the transfer code thing, where i get my id and a password to log back in. i saw my brother playing today and i missed the game, redownloaded and tried logging in. a now many game are facebook, or google i'd. i clicked both and they gave me error. bout a hour in it showed no link to a account. i had a panic attack, all my time, my money, gone. i had a habit of emailing myself the code and i found it. but it wa a they said ""expired"". they won't give me my game back. i wa trying their support and they asked me over specific question like when i started exactly like time too, and when i last logged in. and my level, how many in game currency i had, even the cola which wa when you maxed out a character and got a extra. they said the would email in 7-14 business days. i feel a if i will never get it. so i am hoping right now to just forget about it because it is making me feel like he'll right now. thanks for listening",stress

64,"wasnt surrounded by very nice people nice place or nice things. for the most part growing up i feel like i had some pretty thick skin... then a time went by and life took it toll on me, the stress anxiety and depression happened to wear me down.

i don't feel like i have a hard shell like i used to. almost everything people tell me i feel like rub off the wrong way; whether they mean it or not. i can take a joke but when it come to general comment or statement i possibly overthink and get upset over it. at the time i wanna give a smart remark but hold myself back often.. can there be an underlying issue? possibly the result of trauma",stress

66,"hello.

i have had stress symptom for almost a year. 2 month ago it started getting real bad. i couldnt eat or sleep.
a month ago i went on sick leave from work.

my nervous system ha finally seemed to calm down this past week, and my restlessness ha been replaced by increasing tiredness. i started being able to eat properly and sleep properly most night this past week. today i have been ridiculously tired though.

woke up at 7 am, fell back asleep, slept till 10:30, felt like sleeping more but got up. now it 18:45 and i feel like going to bed.
is that normal??
my recent bloodwork look normal, though my vitamin d is a tad too low (were talking 0.1 too low) and a protein is too low too (also 0.1 too low). the last one is because of my hernia causing me not being able to eat enough.",stress

72,"i know life is supposed to be difficult. i know stressful thing can happen, and that most of u learn how to cope in a healthy way. eating right and exercising are supposed to make u healthy and happy, both physically and mentally. we're supposed to have hobby (beginner at knitting) to keep u occupied and to do our duties, which manifest in the job that i do almost every day. we need to have a network of support from friend and family. life isn't just what happens to you, it's how you react to it. that's what i tell myself.

yet it seems that life, or at least my life, is just one stressful event after another. be it getting rear-ended and struggling with insurance for a few months, a single parent's boyfriend showing up who stress you out for the next few, transferring from one branch to another in your job, looming deadlines, and the knowledge that you have to eat healthily and sleep at least 8 hour a night or you're going to get sick...etc. etc. etc. many time i'm happy and i catch myself wondering when the next bad thing is going to happen. without fail, it does. i deal with it successfully, and it's on to the next one! over and over and over again, catching moment of pleasure and peace in between. it's not a very good comparison, but it's kind of like dark souls, where you die your way through instead of playing your way through.

i'm slowly being chipped away at. i've built an extraordinarily healthy way of living, but it seems at this point that it's just a tower i've built over a foundation under continuous assault by the element that i'm constantly repairing.

i've been tired. so tired. it's like i died a long time ago, and i'm only 23. i know everybody deal with constant stressors, so is everyone secretly feeling this way? is it all drowned in alcohol? drugs? religion? are we supposed to naturally numb ourselves with age? this can't be all that life is!

my grandfather eats junk food. he stand or sits around for most of the day and sometimes he go for a walk before coming home and eating. he's been through the vietnam war and lost almost everything. despite sleep apnea, cancer, a fat-rich diet, and falling once, he's still thriving in his eighties. no one get to that point unless they've got it all figured out inside.

there's something obvious i'm missing, something that appears to make all the difference. i don't think a girlfriend will fix this, nor will any big purchase or materialism. ideally, i'd have a life of inner peace and contentment, filled with steady but peaceful determination. otherwise, life ha no meaning to it.",stress

73,"two month ago i felt numbness in half my body, from head to toes. thought i wa having a seizure, doctor said it wa stress.

i wa fearing for my life, i felt i had a tumor on my brain after googling symptom (dumb on my part), i wa having hallucination on my sleep; to this day i still feel creeped out when i get all those stress sensations.

i guess being so uncertain about stress might be the cause of my psyche hurting. idk.",stress

75,"earlier today i had an eye appointment after what feel like a year and throughout the time i would supposedly have my watch recording so i could listen back to it later on. unfortunately just after i wa done, i found that the thing didnt record anything at all, even though i wa sure i pressed the record button on it!

now ive spent the majority of the day stressed out at the fact that i had to rely on my memory to try to replay what my eye doctor informed me of when my mind already on too many thing to begin with!

i mean i know it supposed to be mundane and something to forget about a the day go one, not to mention how much my own mother kept in telling me to let such thing go and not focus too much on it.  but ive just started taken a habit of recording important thing that went on this week and me not checking to see if my watch wa not recording really took a blow on what wa supposed to be a good enough day today!

77,"i feel like there is no solution, but perhaps someone here can share some insights...

this is the 9th year i will be living with my mom. i never thought it would be almost a decade!!

she stress me out like no one else can. and that is not only wanting to do every little thing for me, but also affording me ver little privacy.

also, i am never ever just relaxing. this is probably the reason my shoulder and neck are stiff a a plank, my weight doesn't go down, always tired, always on the verge of tears, and a few other minor health issue (let's hope they don't become bigger issues!)

i want to move out but finance doe not allow it.

i gym 3 to 4 time a week, try to eat healthy, sleep 8 hours, take a stack of supplements, but find no joy in hobby or socializing (mostly because when i get back home she look at me with doe eye because why did i go off without her)

i often play with my budget to see when/if i can move out, but so far no luck.

80,"to speak i live in south east asia, where work is long hour and pay is only enough to try to survive a month.

i have been managing my stress with family issue too so everything is a bit of a mishmash a i am angrily typing this down. and autism doesn't help with my stress management either.

i had been working in a shitty workplace. the pay ain't bad but to deal with my bos terrible management and temperament which make his employee turnover rate is so high .people would stay around for a week up to 3-4 months, with the group chat kept having people leave and join. a of now there are around 15 people who have come and gone which i seen since the first day i joined and worked here up until now. i heard that this business ha been running for 4-5 year now but from what i seen is almost like an enterprenuerial business with no idea and direction they wanted to do a they have tutoring, selling board games/blind box and even large figurine tradings, throwing menial task at every employee with focus on trying to get more employee to join. i worked around 11-12 hour on average so it make me stressed at first.

then a few day ago when i got home from work (around 11pm almost midnight) my dad called me in to have a talk with him, then he explains that he's worried about my health and my body health. at first i didn't think about it much. me and my father didn't go well for a long time so i think of it more a of a warning, however it turned to make me angry and stressed a he simulate what will happen to me by imagining if i were turned into a disabled person and unable to move at all, with me still able to talk. i got so stressed and tired enough that i didn't get enough sleep after i finally got to excuse myself.

and come up to today a i had enough with today a i tend after their store and i wa a little loopy, i looked like i wa sleeping when i'm actually trying to stay awake. the owner called me that he's been watching me sleeping for 15 minute and he's going to cut my pay. then he ordered me to go to wash my face. i did before coming back, so angry and annoyed that i slapped the store's security camera, hard. luckily it didn't break just the camera cable disconnected so it's an easy fix. so i just called the manager and told them that the camera accidentally fell to the ground and broke, saying that it worked fine after i reassembled it. i wa a little panicked but a little le stressful from that.

81,"hey people,

thanks in advance. recently i tried losing weight: i go to the gym at least four day a week, i stopped drinking soda's on a daily basis and i eat le snack and junk food before, during or after lunch. it's an advancement for me, but i realise it is not really enough to make the step i need to make.

one reason is that food is my 'happy place': whenever i have stress due to my education at uni, or my work schedule or my failing dating and social life, i can eat food and feel better.  i frequently describe it a one of the highlight of my day. anyhow, on another sub people adviced me to see my problem of losing weight in the amount i want a a problem of reducing stress. so that's what i do.

i tried a lot already to reduce stress: going to the gym, not working at nights, try to communicate with someone before embarking on over-ambitious projects, spending le time on my education and trying to stay at home more often to avoid having to travel a lot. still, here i am.  would you have any advice or experience that could help me improve my stress management techniques?",stress

though, this isn't an isolated incident.

i wa meant to deliver asset to another team but neglected to double-check if we had all the asset to deliver. instead, i ignored the issue. the team eventually called me out for it. ideally i should've flagged the issue and had them deal with it... but i wa just too lazy?? it wasn't even a big deal. nothing arduous, but i got too lazy. what's worse is that i didn't own up to my mistake.

i feel soooo ashamed, wow. i don't know what's up. i'm slipping lately, in the most tiny, unnecessary way but it's making me feel so anxious and disappointed in myself.

95,"i wonder if im the only one sometimes going through all this . anyway im a 35 year old male living in los angeles working soon will have my own apartment in a few month because of my autism ( though most people dont know im autistic). i have a roommate currently. i am originally from the sf bay area and while i loved it there i needed a change . weather for one thing and la just seemed so exciting and it is . anyway i moved here in 2018 and love it . so im happy in the city i live in , but im not happy with the circumstance of the last two year and instead of looking back im trying to look forward and realize my lie isnt over and boring and useless. first off i used to go the gym and run and eat healthy, and i wa in much better shape  obviously. than covid came my work hour changed and so did my diet along with everything else. i work retail so those who work it or have will know exactly what im talking about. so in 2022 i tried to restart by going back to being a vegetarian, forcing myself to go back to the gym etc, but my motivation is just not there yet . i do have a small social life so im thankful for that and i am also a photographer a i love all the architecture in this city . but i need more friend my age im
guessing and there just seem to be no woman who arent partiers or who would let me be myself with them . or maybe im looked at a asexual or unattractive. anyways i just need something more exciting than just work and home . i wish i had a group o could do thing with but of course my schedule make it tough .

my dating/sex history:
i wa never very good at asking woman out even though most of my life i wa told i wa extremely handsome im tall 61 blonde hair , brown eye . i wa told i could have modeled when i wa younger . anyway i didnt lose my virginity till i wa 20 which is late but partly because i wa shy , just not confident. i had an opportunity to be that girl boyfriend who i lost my virginity to but i just decided i didnt want a relationship with her , well between 2007 and 2009 i had no heterosexual sex but desired it but wa insecure, etc . ill admit because i grew up in san francisco and had gay friend i even experimented with gay men a a way out since i wa just not having relationship with woman but i realized obviously i wa not gay or bi since i didnt feel attracted to men . than im 2010 i had sex with a drunk cougar and that wa one and done . i had a disasterous date with a woman in the mission district in sf and it wa horrible. i than tried going to  cougar bar with my friend but of course we would never go home with anyone, and it wasnt my scene anyway. than in 2012 i met my first girlfriend who wa older than me at a class. funny thing is i liked her immediately and she clearly liked me . we saw the batman dark knight movie which wa our first date in 2012. well we fucked like crazy so much so that i felt it wa a bit much and the non sexual side of our relationship seemed kinda ehhh.
well i eventually drove her away and regretted it . and since then ive slept with a few older woman from 2015-2019. but since covid ive had no sex except masturbation . partly i still do struggle with being insecure and feeling like woman will never be into me which i know is nonsense of course . but i am now have a strange sense of being torn on one hand i would like to be in a relationship, on the other hand my life is busy enough with work and exploring stuff in la with my camera . i almost feel like the woman would have to be perfect for me because i feel like maybe my earlier history told me something that im just someone who lost their virginity late and because of it maybe it messed me up or maybe im better off just with a few friend and my own life . partly i think i need someone who i can be myself around them without judgment and im trying to change . maybe im just to weird or absent minded . i try to work on my confidence and i try to
fake it till i make it but that can only last so long . i do have confidence issue and while im secretive about it deep inside i feel like most woman are either judging me or think im unattractive , or that im gay.

i guess i need to work on myself . i want to get back into shape , eat healthier, exercise like i used to . also i use to shave everyday clean shaven and short hair but when covid came i got lazy. im going to try and get myself together and work on myself. i take my medication for depression which help and i do have a therapist but i cant see her a much a id like . i do have challenge but i always try to work through them

my issue with sex, relationships, asking woman out :
i have often had issue with asking woman out , etc. it weird maybe i am incel yet i dont blame my problem on woman i blame it all on myself that im my own worst enemy. i tend to shoot myself in the foot . it weird because i dont consider myself repressed. i grew up in a liberal household in san francisco. i also am not a right winger a most incels are . i am liberal . anyways so most men can ask a woman out with no problem and nothing would faze them . i on the other hand have trouble because i dont want to make a fool of myself, come off a creepy etc . good example is there is this customer at work who i like and come in most everyday . her and i talk quite a bit when im helping her and we smile at each other . and i think she like me , but probably just being friendly. two of my colleague know i like her and always ask  have you asked her out yet  i always give an excuse or that she wouldnt want to have anything to do with me that way.  so other guy could just ask a woman out with no issue but not me. also im not at my best right now and want to get back to being healthy and exercise. the funny thing is i can talk to beautiful woman because i do every day because i work in beverly hill and i can engage and be friendly but on my own i dont seek out to talk to woman because of my own fear a how they view me. the funny thing is i did ask my ex gf out but it wasnt really a date asking her out it wa more casual and thing developed. i just wonder if i can overcome these issue that have been plaguing me for a good chunk of my life . i just sometimes feel im cursed .h",stress

a care contemplation course might be a successful at lessening uneasiness a a typical medicine, a per another review.

the exploration, distributed on november 9 in jama psychiatry, involved a gathering of 276 grown-ups with untreated uneasiness problems. a big part of the patient wa haphazardly chosen to take 10 to 20 mg of escitalopram, the nonexclusive type of lexapro, a typical medicine used to treat nervousness and wretchedness. the other half were relegated to an eight-week course in care-based pressure decrease.

the outcome were dazzling: the two gathering experienced about a 20% decrease in their tension side effect over the eight-week time span.

elizabeth hoge, the lead creator on the review and the overseer of the tension issue exploration program at georgetown college clinical center, let cnn know that she trust the examination can open up greater treatment choice for patient with uneasiness.

ive been at my new job for a little over a year now and they are so flexible and have no issue with me taking time off but of course i built up this wall because of previous job and im always terrified to ask for time off when i need to go to a doctor appointment.

my doctor is like your health is more important than your job and you need to make this work so that you can do everything you need to do to handle your autoimmune diseases. obviously, my health is more important than a job but he doesnt think about the fact that company dont give a shit about health and if i lose my job due to taking time off, i wont be able to afford insurance or pay out-of-pocket for him.

125,"today is stress awareness day so i want to share some statistic and resource available for people suffering from stress:

&amp;#x200b;

* the most common cause of stress is work-related stress with 79% saying they frequently felt it. (statista)
* 74% of people feel so stressed they have been overwhelmed or unable to cope. (mental health foundation and yougov)
* 13.7 million working day are lost each year in the uk because of work-related stress, anxiety and depression, costing 28.3 billion yearly. (nice)

tips to deal with stress:
\-**explore your triggers**: keep a diary for one week to discover which situation increase your stress level the most.
\-**practice time management**: trying to do everything at once isn't an effective way to handle stress a it usually take you longer to complete your tasks. ensure that you are organised by managing your time efficiently.
**-set boundaries:** it's easy to be available 24 hour a day due to current technology. establish some boundary so work is distanced from your personal life.
**-life outside of work:** to avoid experiencing burnout you must take some time to look after yourself and engage in activity you enjoy.
**-build a support network:** speaking with and meeting up with friend and family can help you feel more positive and reduce your vulnerability to stress.
**-focus on healthy habits:** avoid alcohol, caffeine and nicotine, get enough sleep, eat well and be active.

**-do a course:** there are plenty of course available that will teach you to understand the symptom and cause of stress, step you can take to deal with your stress and will help you practice dealing with stressful situation in the safety of exercises. for example, **virtualspeech** is offering a free trial for their managing workplace stress course and **futurelearn** also offer a workplace wellbeing course.",stress

128,"while fear, shock, and disgust are typically seen a negative emotion that we want to avoid, they can also be an enjoyable experience in certain situations.

horror movie are one of the best example of this. when youre watching a horror movie about ghosts, zombies, serial killers, aliens, or monsters, your nervous system naturally kick into gear a if youre experiencing a real threat from your environment.

**this** [**fight, flight, or freeze**](https://www.theemotionmachine.com/the-complete-guide-to-daily-stress/)**-response creates a biochemical rush of adrenaline, endorphins, and dopamine, which can create a type of natural high.**

however, while your body experience the natural high of a real threat, your brain know deep down that youre actually safe and secure  and there no real danger present.

one early [study](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/bf00995932) published in the journal *motivation and emotion* looked into why people enjoy eating really spicy food (such a chili peppers) and found a similar response.

chili enjoyer still feel the same irritation and pain of eating spicy food a everyone else, but they enjoy the rush of adrenaline and endorphin it produces. it stimulates the body warning system in a harmless and risk-free way that can be exciting and exhilarating.

this type of [positive thrill-seeking](https://www.theemotionmachine.com/positive-thrill-seeking/) can be found in many other relatively safe and harmless activities, such a riding rollercoasters, extreme sports, skydiving, an intense workout, or playing competitive video games.

**new psychology research show that the experience of negative emotion (in a safe and controlled context) can be very enjoyable and beneficial.**

one [study](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30307264/) published in the scientific journal *emotion* found that voluntarily arousing negative emotion (vane)  such a purposely making ourselves scared  can lead to an overall boost in mood, like when we watch a horror movie or visit a haunted house.

the study looked at individual who bought ticket for an extreme haunted house event, which wa designed to elicit a variety of negative emotion such a anxiety, fear, shock, and disgust.

after the haunted house experience, most individual reported an overall boost in euphoria and positive mood, especially if they felt tired, bored, or stressed beforehand.

while the sample is biased (people who buy ticket to haunted house are more likely to enjoy them), the study doe reveal that some people genuinely enjoy scaring themselves.

furthermore, the study found that individual who enjoyed the haunted house experience also showed le stress while completing subsequent cognitive and emotional test (including showing le reactivity in the brain during those tests, a measured by eeg recordings).

researchers theorize that voluntarily arousing negative emotion (vane) can teach u how to better deal with future stress and anxiety.

this is a common technique behind a lot of *exposure therapy*, where a person is gradually put into a fearful situation so they become more desensitized to some irrational fear or phobia. for example, a person scared of flying may be asked by a therapist to visualize themselves getting on a plane until they learn to manage their fear better.

by actively exposing ourselves to fear, shock, or disgust in a safe and controlled way, we get to practice regulating these emotion in the moment, which is an important pillar of [emotional intelligence](https://www.theemotionmachine.com/4-fundamental-pillars-of-emotional-intelligence/).

**horror movies** ***simulate*** **extraordinary experience that we normally wouldnt have in the real world. when we watch a horror movie, we put ourselves in the protagonist position and ask ourselves,** ***what would i do in this situation?***

new research show fan of horror movie may even be more prepared to face real-world catastrophes.

one fascinating [study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/pmc7492010/) published in *personality and individual differences* discovered that fan of horror movie and pandemic movie were more resilient during the covid pandemic. it wa also found that fan of prepper genre in particular (alien-invasion, apocalyptic, and zombie films) exhibited both greater resilience and preparedness.

this is one reason why pandemic movie such a *contagion* and *28 day later* showed a huge spike in popularity during covid.

ultimately, horror movie give u a chance to face our fear and practice [mentally rehearsing](https://www.theemotionmachine.com/mental-rehearsal-changing-habits-through-the-power-of-visualization/) how we would respond in extremely intense situations. a the famous horror writer stephen king once said, a good horror story help u understand our own deepest fears.",stress

when it come to dealing with stress, were often told the best thing we can do are exercise, make time for our favorite activities, or try meditation or mindfulness.

but the kind of food we eat may also be an effective way of dealing with stress, according to research published by me and other member of apc microbiome ireland.

our latest study ha shown that eating more fermented food and fiber daily for just four week had a significant effect on lowering perceived stress levels.

131,"i am 28 year old and my birthday is tomorrow. i am not the one who care much about my age or celebrates it. however i am having a very bad week and seem too stressed out.

to start with, i wa on a weekend trip with my girl friend to relax and meet after 2 long years. it wa fun. but i am always the 3rd wheel in that friendship. they both are nice to me and they wish well for me. but i am the complete opposite of them. they are funny , crack joke , extrovert and i am none of it. i just listen to them and enjoys the company sort of. they are good looking and can carry themselves. i am bit on the fatty side and doe not look much good in the pictures. i think it always bother me.

anyways , i come back from the trip and thought to stay with my boyfriend for some days. i feel lonely even when he is around. he get very excited about his work and talk continuously about it. i am very much discouraged and demotivated by it even though i should not. he helped with a lot of stuff at work. i keep wondering why i am not excited a much a he is. i am interested in doing my work but i am not an expert. just an average person at work. but i am a team lead too and the management part of come easily for me.

i normally handle the new joinee mentorship, any documentations, managing the team call , setting up sessions. somewhat what a culture team would do. i like doing this but i don't want to be known for it. anyways past week, my department head called me up and said he sending some name selected for attending a training and asked to review it. i thought i might be in it but i wa not. every lead except me which made me very sad. i do not know why i wa not even considered. i am not that bad. yet again.

this all happened when i wa still at my boyfriend's place. i don't think he know i wa struggling with all this negative vibe happening. still i thought i will hold my head high. i started going through my drive which the girl uploaded the pic of us. i don't normally go through it. i thought i might a well because my sister wa asking for pics. so i selected some which i looked better with them. i thought i will send some good one and some bad one for the fun of it. the moment i send it, she replied telling me i look terrible in it. that i have put on too much weight and no one would tell this to my face. by that point, i wa breaking down. i wa cry hard and wa feeling so much heavy in my heart. i wa with my boyfriend and yet he doe not know my heart wa breaking with all the pain. i don't if i should blame him or i should have gone to him. may be he doe not know i am struggling and i am not willing to tell him my struggles.

so i texted my sister back, "" yup, i know"". i don't think she know i wa upset. then my second sister texted me saying i should take care of my health. our family ha diabetes genes. she wa telling me the same thing. i wa okay with her msging but i am very upset with the other sister for bitching about my weight. i only send pic to her.

this all happened on friday. at work, i did literally nothing. i could not do anything. i keep thinking about hypothetical scenario and to wishful thinking if i could just leave everything behind. it wa so much pain.

tomorrow is my birthday and i want to be alone..just alone. i don't know what to do. i don't know if this birthday is the thing that's making me miserable. but honestly i am not worried about getting aged. i am just tired. i know i should not expect people to come to you. but oh man i wish i could have someone who can feel me and i can open up to. i know i have people to talk. people will listen to me. but i can't open up to them. everything is bottled up inside and i am so so stressed and sad and what not.

136,i'm 21 year old and i recently enrolled in college i ended up choosing a really hard course. my parent were paying for it but i still failed them and i had no choice but to drop the course.  i went to go drop it today however on the way out i got into a fender bender which will be my second accident this year and i'm still on my parent insurance. i'm such a colossal fuckup and i don't know what i can do to repair this situation. i'm going to go get a job soon so the finical strain wont be too hard but i just cant believe how much ive ruined my parent trust they placed in me. the worst part is it all my fault i just cant believe how easy it is to ruin trust and respect and how hard it is to earn it back. i feel paralyzed i cant calm down and this is ontop of the fact that i have anxiety over searching for a job. i threw up due to how stressed i was. i feel like i cant talk to anyone but stranger about how bad i feel right now. i just have no idea how to be ok.,stress

137,"hi all, i thought this would be a good place to ask.

sometimes it best for my stress and anxiety to flat out block apps and website that cause me stress. i have a very bad habit of wanting to dig thing up from the past, even if they would hurt me, and often time the best way for me to combat this is to restrict myself from accessing social media.

right now i've been using an app called 'freedom' which ha been very useful. the issue? i've figured out how to disable it whenever i want. knowing that at any point i could breach the restriction i put in place just make me super anxious. i'm able to go into the vpn setting and turn off 'connect on demand' which allows me to bypass the block.

does anyone know any surefire way i can block things, and not have access to them? being able to set a block on social medium for 24 hour is often the best way i can get back on track with my day, and stop stressing over digging up thing that would hurt me. is self discipline my only option, or is there a better way?",stress

138," i (26f), am going through it tonight. honestly? i couldn't tell if my post belonged in the anxiety or rant subreddit, but i asked myself aloud, ""how do i feel?"", and my answer was: stressed.

so, here i am.

crying and bawling my eye out. 'why?' you might ask. well, i'll tell you a little bit about me...i am an overweight female who ha gone through shit in my 26 year of living. my childhood wa basically robbed of me, mainly because i witnessed fight and screaming match between family member and a near divorce with the parentals. i wa also bullied majority of my early childhood all the way through middle school. after all of this happened (and there wa a lot more than that), i felt like i wa forced to grow up and basically chose 'flight mode' to save myself.

what i mean by that is, closing myself off. staying in my room and coming out when i absolutely have to. i have a fear of being rejected, and being a failure. i am afraid of being yelled at for doing something wrong and i have a fear of getting into trouble and being reprimanded.

i still live with my parent and i have no job because of just basically, being socially anxious. i stutter around people i don't know and that make me even more anxious and self-conscious. i forget thing easily and that in turn, furthers my fear of being incapable of a job. on top of that, i have trouble sleeping at night because thought run through my head a million time a second. because of this, i wake up late almost everyday (at 11am).

just tonight, my mom basically dumped a, 'we need to talk' case on me and already i felt my blood run cold. she's talking to me but all i hear is my heart thumping in my ears. she tell me i need to work on waking up early because the rest of the world wake up early like ""adults"". i felt very offended by that and told her that it's not my fault that i can't sleep properly at night. i, in fact, tell this to her everyday, so it's not old news. yet, when i did remind her of this, she basically sighed and almost wanted to roll her eyes. then she tell me i need a week to just 'work on myself' to fix that and realistically, thats not how that work but i didn't say anything.

then she tell me i need to find a job. something that pay and that 70% of the world get up and doe a 9 to 5 job which i already knew. now, i wa starting think she think i'm lazy or something when it's absolutely not the case.

truth is, i have been getting together with my younger sister who is an artist on doing freelance stuff that we are both interested in doing. we have been talking about it little by little. i told my mom this and she didn't seem to believe me, basically looking at me with an expression of, ""ohhh really like what"".

so she asks, ""okay, what have y'all worked on today?"" of all thing she asks on the day me and my younger sister decide to take at least the day off from planning. i said, ""well, we are taking a break today but i designed some stuff for xx and sended it to her and she reformatted and polished it up."" my mom seemed to deflate in a way that said, 'that wa it?'

not gonna lie, it made me feel bad and then she went into a repeated 5 minute lecture on how we need to wake up earlier and start the day like adults. meanwhile i'm here depressed, stressed and just over it at this point. over the fact that she just doesn't understand at all. she says, 'i know you can do it. i know that.'

but doe she really? anytime i do, 'do it', she seemes to be unsatisfied and that push me a million step back.

i get upset and after we finish talking, i go to my room to sleep (11pm at this point) and i just start bawling at how useless i felt and the whole, 'why is my life like this'.

it took so much in me not to burst into tear in front of her but man my throat wa tighrening so bad it hurt that i couldn't speak for a good few seconds.

i don't know, i guess i just need some advice on the situation? anytime i'm in this position my stress literally go through the roof and i don't know how to manage it (like the need to runaway, disappear or worse). i really do want to work, i want to recieve a paycheck and get my own place and my own car and things, but why am i always on flight mode all the time?",stress

i have a feeling that if i fail a question or something like that i just start to contemplate my life even after the exam. even like i would get on the verge of tear if i didn't know something. like if i fail the exam, i don't have good grades, then i don't go to a good university, then i don't get a job or either i get a job with little pay, people make fun of me, etc.

honestly make me feel anxious, but even if i have coping technique sometimes i still really wish i could just put myself into extremely stressful environments. but not like life-threatening events, i just want to put myself under immense, crippling stress when i do everyday basic thing (like practicing an exam paper, or cleaning within a time limit).

sometimes i feel that it necessary for me to just stress myself out 24/7, then after that i'll develop a good stress tolerance or something like that. i just really wished i were one of those people who are extremely good at managing stress, and never shed a tear in a very long time (and i mean, years).

to be honest, i know it sound like i'm really self-sabotaging, but no matter how much i really want to pressure myself to the extremes, i have a feeling it probably isn't right for me. but then again, there's people around me (especially on the internet) who study for hours, or work for many hours, and probably do well under pressure.

221,"hello :)

i've made a little relaxation video, which might help you to find a little calm in the midst of chaos.

it's actually based on jacobson's progressive muscle relaxation (pmr) which is a scientifically based and easy-to-learn deep relaxation technique.  in the video we will briefly tense one muscle group after another, followed by a relaxation phase.  the interaction between physical and mental tension and thus relaxation is the focus and should help you find the relaxation you are looking for.

i hope it help you :) all the best

222,"so these past few week ive pretty much lost control over my emotions. im in a constant state of confusion and stress but i also feel like a zombie.

my job is the main source of this. it hard to explain but ill give it a go. this is a temporary job that wa supposed to last from march 2021-september 2021, but it ha gotten extended multiple time and now our end date is set for february 2022. i work for a company that is contracted through to state to do covid vaccinations. our team doe only mobile clinic and i am in charge of logistics. this mean i am in charge of the vaccine storage, supply storage, supply packing, supply chain, receiving vaccine shipments, keeping inventory and such. i am the only person who doe this job at our location. i am required to get each team ready and pack supply and vaccine before the clinic and to return everything once the team return. this schedule ha been ruining my sleep. for instance, wednesday i will finish work at 9:30pm. i will be back at work thursday at 5:30am, but i wont be done with work until 10pm, all to be back at work again at 5am friday morning. im working 6 day a week, not getting more than 5 hour of sleep on the average.

oh and im getting married in le than 3 weeks. im constantly forgetting things, my performance at work is struggling and my mental state is awful. i tried to get out of a moving car on the highway the other night. ive cried everyday the past week. im angry, irrational and miserable. im barely eating, im averaging 10000 step a day and still gaining weight. my family and my partner have begged me to take a day off. but if i take a day off it wont actually be a day off. nobody else know how to do my job in total. whenever ive taken off before it always mean more stress when i return, or theyll just contact me while im off, because they dont know what to do especially if it an unplanned absence.

i am hoping to take the entire week of my wedding off and i need to train my bos before that happens. he doesnt know how to do my job at all and he said he is covering for my wedding. do i follow my family advice and call in sick for a day or just stick it out for the next 2 week and hope i dont end up dead?",stress

223,"i'm a mid 30's man with a somewhat stressful job and feel like i can't keep stress under control. i have high bp and just the smallest thing sends me into a spiral. i try everything, meditation, exercise (have lost 50 pound so far), yoga, eating healthy. i go to the doctor and i get that sense of ""impending doom"" and my bp go through the roof. i feel 100% fine in the moment, i am chill and relaxed a a cucumber, but i think subconsciously my body is freaking out? i assume this is stress. i know white coat syndrome is real, but when i go in the dr's office it happens without fail. and of course my bp reading is high. i just wish i could control my mind lol. my dr. did test to see if my cortisol level are off, and they are perfect. bloodwork is perfect.they did mri's of my heart, probably a half dozen other test to check if my heart is okay, and it is. which tell me this is likely stress related bp. i am doing so well health wise, and with the weight loss i thought i'd see more progress in stress relief, but it is still happening and my bp still spike due to stress. it's like my body is triggered ridiculously by it, and i wish there wa a magic button to fix it. is there anything you all do that maybe i could try that i am not trying? i have googled my a$$ off trying to find the solutions, but i feel they just say to ""manage stress"" and it's not that easy for some of us. i go for 1-2 walk a day, i exercise, i eat healthy and try to avoid inflammatory foods. i have been sleeping well, at least my fitness tracker say so. i do not know what else i could possibly do but i am hoping i can find that thing that work for me. thank you all.",stress

first half of my day is usually buy and i have early dinner everyday (7pm). after dinner is my relaxing time but i am too tired to relax and spend quality time with my partner after that. i feel like i demand too much from myself and feel bad if i miss a chore, a workout, or dont eat meal a per my weekly plans. oh yes, i make weekly meal and workout plans! i have been this way for a long a i know.

226,"im in a city where most of my family resides, but im homeless because id rather be alone than be around negative people.

its been a few month since i chose this path and ive been strong the entire way through it, until now.

just got out of a short relationship that wa bit toxic for my taste. she wa basing our relationship off of shall we say, physical aspects.

i just found out on top of that, she wa fucking her ex while weve been talking and just yesterday she told me that she belief she may be pregnant by her ex, but it too early to take a pregnancy test.

so, i acted normal let the conversation flow a it would over the phone until we finished and, i could not stop thinking about what she had just told me.

next day i told her we should brake up, we did. she blamed everything on me. i kept my cool, explained how i felt. i wa ignored.

so, i created distance so i could heal.


but ive come to the conclusion that i dont want to heal, i just want this to end. ive never been more ready to end my life until today, not because of the break up, but because of everything. the condition of the world, our future, the situation with my family. not being able to find and get a place of my own and stuck in a city i absolutely hate.

227,"the more week go by, the more helpless i feel about this course. i hate the professor, i hate the lab partners, i hate the tas, i hate the activity and homework we have to do and i hate physic the most.

i never had a sturdy foundation in physic anyways. the only reason i managed with physic in high school wa because i memorized most of the solution and most of the problem were similar to the other problem i practiced. besides, my tutor wa good at helping me learn.

i'm doing an introductory physic course this semester, and i feel so absolutely dumb. we're supposed to work in group to complete activity and every week we are given a set of problem for homework. the professor add a set of puzzle at the end of every assignment to supposedly promote logical thinking and spatial reasoning or whatever.

the thing is i never really liked physic in the first place, but not i hate it. the lab are for two hours, i can't understand a single concept and the people in my group are so snide and rude about the fact that they understand the class and i can't. i remember asking for help about a homework problem to them on discord, and i would have been grateful if they had given me a few hint about how they solved that problem, but all they did wa send the wrong answer and made a bunch of meme about how they trolled me. one of the guy is so arrogant about how he took ap physic and he know all of the concept and is so good at physics.

meanwhile i can't even do a single problem independently. the professor also give a bunch of puzzle like kenkens or spatial reasoning problem that i'm too dumb to do and i'm doing the worst in that class. it's just too much for me.

aside from that course, i'm in computer science and while my other class aren't a awful, they're also pretty difficult. plus, i have work study, and most of my work hour coincide with the office hours. i still have to take the course a a requirement and i feel like i'm going to fail. i get panic attack every night thinking about it and i can't deal with it anymore.",stress

228,"hey, joined this community just now since i kinda need some life advice, from anyone.

i've always been stressing out a lot over various things, but a of recently i started to realise that it ha taken over my life in various ways.

for example, even a of recently i wa supposed to drive a group of friend to a theme park. just a fun day, but the responsibility of driving my friend there somehow made me insanely nervous, even though i wa ""calm inside"" if that make sense. a a result i slept 0 hour in total. melatonin didn't work, meditating did nothing, breathing exercise did nothing, my mind just kept on racing.
(p.s. a friend drove in my car for me, i'm not driving on 0 hr of sleep)


it's not just that single event though. school day cause stress, test cause stress, even having a totally free day but having to receive a package the next day cause sleep issue and stomach aches.
when doing thing i'm always thinking about the worst thing that could happen, and what if that would happen, even if the chance are minimal, which only add up to the stress.
idk anymore, should i visit a psychiatrist? like what do you do here? this ha been ongoing for at least 10 year now, i'm currently 22 and this ha to stop

thnx :)",stress

237,"i'm a 18 (f) freshman in college, i have been going to this library on campus for the past few day there ha been this recurring guy (im assuming 18/19)  that i have seen every time (we have never spoken but have made a lot of eye contact) i have been there. there have been some time where the library wa packed and i had to sit at the same table a him and vice versa today i wa sitting alone at this table that me and him have sat at together a few time and he came over and sat at this table with one of his friends.

eventually one of my friend showed up and soon after his friend left (this left,  me, my friend and him at a table that seat 4 people) soon after one of my other friend showed up so all the stats at the table where filled. we where all just working quietly for around an hour. after that hour he later  left and my friend left soon after. i spent another hour there by myself finishing up some work

i am a big glancer i look around a lot whenever i am doing something so this ha caused me and this boy to make a lot of eye contact. when i wa taking a break from my work i saw him coming back into the building me and him made eye contact and he quickly walked away this wa a bit of a surprise because he usually sits down

i assumed that he either wanted the table for himself or he had some friend coming and needed a bigger table. so i moved seat i got up and went to a single table. i went to go fill up my water bottle after i placed my stuff down at the new table, when i wa walking back to my new table i made eye contact with him again because he wa walking the same direction.

i sat down at my new table and put my airpods in assuming that he moved to the table that sat 4 people, out of the corner of my eye i saw him walk up to my table. i took my airpods out and he asked me ""hey, you didn't move seat because of me right?"" with ought even thinking i just quickly shook my head and said  ""oh no!"" before i could say anything else he said ""ok i wa just making sure, have a nice day"" and he walked away.

i ended up soon leaving after just beacuse there wa no way i could focus after all of that but now im worried i have scared this boy off and ill never see him at the library anymore. i really dont know what to think i wa hoping you guy would be able to give your option",stress

i just feel like i havent gotten a break from life, working all the time while doing school full timewhile not having a permanent place to call home for 7 months. i am staying with my sister a of now, but even then, the other aspect of my life are just building up that stress. for example, the workplace i used to work for mistreated their employees, and i left. the same day, my car battery died and then my car died that same week. i dropped 2k (which is all i had in my bank account) to pay it to get fixed..then i got rejected from 10+ more job the week after. i just want it all to stop.

264,"it's hard to explain, i'm guessing it some sort of stress, but i can't figure out how to get over it.  a little background.  before the beginning of covid lockdown (like right before) i had a major breakdown and went into severe depression.  my sister wa about to go through a life saving organ transplant (which went well), i had someone break up with me, i had 2 major career defining project i wa leading that weren't going well, and i wa suffering from a torn labrum which stopped me from doing a hobby i loved.  all of this happening in the span of about a week.

it took me a long time to get out of my depression.  i took medication, stopped worrying a much about having a great career, learned meditation and practiced it daily, found a new hobby, and tried enjoying life more over the span of the pandemic.  i decided to make it a point to get away from my previous job a it caused me a major amount of stress.  they overworked me, and the pay wasn't great for the amount of responsibility put on my shoulders.

it took me nearly 1.5 year to finally land a new job and leave that job behind.  i have fantastic boss at my new job, they pay me well and make sure that i'm compensated for my overtime whenever that is necessary (which isn't often).  the only complaint i have about my job is it's a bit boring and not very challenging (or at least it shouldn't be).

now here's my major problem.  i'm falling behind on my work and not learning at the speed i use to when starting a new job.  i'm having difficulty learning all the system and part even though most of my job is just surveying equipment, and designing simple part and cable assemblies.

every time i start on a new task or job, i start experiencing a dull stress and what i think is ""brain fog"".  it feel like the top of my brain just hardens, and i get a mild headache.  over the day it drain me, but once i get off work i start quickly recovering.

i use to thrive doing challenging work and continually learning new thing in my field.  now i just feel tired all the time.  i'm tired of feeling like this.  i've asked for more challenging task from my bos and i get them, but it doesn't help.

i just want to feel unburdened again at work.",stress

279,"first off, i have ptsd from being in the military. i overreact to stressor in my environment significantly. so i am totally aware of having higher stress level than the average person. but what i do not understand is why my muscle stay tense 24/7.

i mainly feel this in my neck/jaw/shoulders area. i literally (and not saying this like ""omg i literally died the other day when...but a in the way the term is actually meant for) feel like i cannot let my head relax into my pillow at night. it's like my body refuse to allow the pillow to take the weight of my head. i can consciously think, ""ok, i'm gonna relax my neck now and let my head fall deep into this pillow,"" and it works...for a few fleeting moment until i stop actively thinking about it. second later i will realize that my shoulder are up to my ear again, and my neck is no longer relaxing.

i keep my jaw tense all the time a well. so much so that i have so many chipped teeth that my dentist ha stopped fixing them until they get really bad. i have a bite guard for sleeping, but i think the damage is also done during the day. i asked my wife the other day which wa ""normal"" for her: when not thinking about it, do your top and bottom teeth stay closed/touching each other, or is there a small gap? she went with the small gap, and i can see that my body want that to be my normal too, but it is not. my teeth stay chomped down onto each other, nearly 24/7. i'd bet my neck and teeth stay tense even when i am asleep.

i absolutely hate this. i can never get comfortable. i cannot sleep well. i look like a 10 year old with adhd because i'm constantly wiggling around while seated in order to get some sort of comfort here and there. and all this misery boil down to the tension in these 3 areas.

anyone have any suggestion for this? i've told my dr many time at the va about this, and i have muscle relaxers, but rarely take them because they make me super sleepy during the day, and if i take them at night, i feel kinda hung over the next morning. so i only take them when in absolute discomfort.

i go to a chiropractor 2x a week. i go to physical therapy for shoulder issue 2x a week. i regularly use a foam roller and a chirp wheel, almost daily, several time a day. i even started yoga this week...but i've only been once so far.

oh, and i get a massage 2x a month, by a massage therapist at the chiropractor, who can target area of concern from my chiropractic file. so not a feel good massage, but one that work on working knot out and loosening ligament (not sure if i am using the right terminology there). last week, after several months, she wa able to finally ""get in"" my upper trap and for a few amazing, godly seconds, i actually felt true neck relaxation. it wa so wonderful....and so sad when it quickly went back to my normal. but that fleeting glimpse of bliss told me that it is possible to find relief.

so i have finally turned to reddit to ask for help.",stress

went to other doctor and and the 1st side effect went away, but the adult medication gave me more and worse side effects, so again me psychiatrist suggested changing meds. my mom already had some bad impression on the doctor so after they tried to change again with no wait to see if i'd get better, she told me to stop taking any med altogether.

i get why, my appetite is lower than usual and i am super sensible to climate and temperature, my intestine are hurting and my head ache everyday. so i am currently on the process of adapting. and a new college period stared when i wa told to change med for the 2nd time... i am barely keeping up again with whats being teached and although i got the handle of how college works, i am suffering. stuff that usually don't bother me or gove me so much work are really demanding me. i am not taking note a i'd like or being able to concentrate in almost any task that is mildly difficult. am currently procrastinating the 36 page and topic that range from a to z of architecture topic that i have to summarise and another 17 page that i also will summarise, all for today untill 11:59 pm, currently the hour is 19:07...",stress

282,"hello guys,weve havent seen anything related to binaural beat here, so i thought of sharing something that might be useful to you guys, because it helped me a ton. binaural beat are claimed to induce various same mental state associated like reduce anxiety, relieve stress while increasing relaxation, increase focus and concentration, promote creativity, dreaming etc. in essence a binaural beat is an acoustic stereo signal, typically a sine wave, from which the left channel is slightly detuned to the right channel. this difference, measured in hz, produce a waving motion that is actually audible when listened to on stereo headphones. this difference dictate the speed of the binaural beat which ha different effect on your brain. each frequency is associated with outcome that correspond to different level of brain wave activity. here is a little guide on the most important frequency ranges:


* gamma waves: between 30 hz and 50 hz, linked to higher alertness, concentration, and improved problem solving, learning, memory and mood.
* beta waves: between 13 hz and 30 hz, similar to gamma, linked to an active and alert mind, improves mood and task performance
* alpha waves: between 8 hz and 13 hz, indicate a relaxed and restful mind, can increase creativity
* theta waves: between 4 hz and 8 hz, associated with drowsiness and meditation, reduced anxiety, relaxation
* delta waves: between 0.5 hz and 4 hz, relaxation, deep sleep, dreaming

there is a lot of stuff on youtube you can check out and listen to. i mostly listen to binaural beat in the beta range for sleeping, meditation and lucid dreaming. after 10 minute you really feel like your are sinking deeper in your mind. these beat are often accompanies by music playing on top of them, which is sometimes really nice, but we have a created a some natural ambience that feature binaural beats. if you want to check out our channel, you can do so here. wed love to get feedback on those a well. :)

i want to feel, but there is nothing in my body. when i am sad and angry i just know, because there is nothing in my body. no surge of rage and no pain in my chest.

i also never get a feeling associated with a place or memory. when i think of a memory i get no spontanious emotion connected to it.

like sitting on the terrace with a nice cup of tee, early morning walks, sitting down on the couch after a hard day of work. never get these feeling in my body. also the feelifn of autimn, friday, christmas. all gone. cant even remember them in my mind because i cant feel with my brain.

im already generally extremely sleep deprived and have recently started nodding off while driving home to/from work some days. a lot of day i dont even have time to eat much of anything some days.

what am i supposed to do? i feel very backed into a corner with all of this.",stress

299,"i thought i need to ""hustle my way to success"" but what i learned next changed my life forever

the ""hustle culture"" is pretty toxic...

i wa being told that working 10-12 hour a day, constantly chasing after the next task, and being totally drained afterwards, not even able to enjoy a dinner with my family is the way to success...

and believe me, i've done that for way too long.

after quitting my 9-5 job and deciding to start my first coaching business, i basically switched from working 8 hour a day, 5 day a week to 12 hour a day, 6 day a week.

""finally quit the rat race!"", huh?

quite frankly, it felt like le pressure than doing the typical 9-5 at the beginning because i wa really excited to work on my dream.

as the month passed, i wa getting deeper and deeper into the grind.

it got to a point where i would wake up at 9:00 am, already thinking about work, then work through the whole day, and still be replying to my clients' message at 1:30 am, lying in bed with my girlfriend.

my mind wa constantly there - at work.

at the dinner table, during a walk with my partner, even when skiing on vacation that i rarely took back then...

i wa constantly experiencing this weird sense of guilt when i wasn't productive, and even though my business wa growing, so wa my anxiety, stress, and lack of satisfaction with life.

it eventually led to me getting sick so badly, that it wa a struggle to even reply to a client's message.

i wa stressed out of my mind.

it felt like everything is going to collapse on me if i keep going down that route.

finally, i decided to take a real break.

i took a full 7 day off and decided to delete all the apps like slack, messenger and gmail from my phone, which sounded absolutely crazy to me back then.

but man, it felt liberating.

something clicked inside me, and finally, i wa able to let go of all the pressure and stress that were haunting me.

for the first time in months, i experienced this deep sense of relief and inner peace.

by stepping out of this craziness, i wa able to notice how toxic and unhealthy it was.

how having healthy boundary and balance in your life is key to actually enjoying what you're doing and what you're working so hard for.

now, i truly believe that me getting crazy sick back then wa one of the best thing that could have happened to me.

it led to me finally re owning the enjoyment of my everyday life.

plus, my business started rapidly growing a a result of me allocating my time more effectively and creating more value in le time.

it made me realize that much of ""the hustle"" i wa doing wa just me spinning my wheel on thing that weren't really making the boat go faster.

now, i know for sure that the best way to achieve better result is to master both the work and the relaxation.

to plan the life in such a way, that your wealth, health, and relationship are in perfect balance.

303,"hi there, so this playlist (available at both apple music and spotify) came to life almost a year ago, when i'd finished researching the effect of listening to nature sounds.

easily explained:you may have heard about our inherited fight-or-flight response system, which is a major factor in stress and anxiety. well, research ha shown that listening to nature sound trigger the opposite system, called rest-or-digest, which help lowering your heart rate, ease tightening muscle and enable you to focus on fewer things. these system is, just like our f-o-f response, is inherited from our ancestors. we believe that reason behind nature sound triggering this is that hearing birds, rain etc meant positive thing for the caveman generations. bird singing meant that there were no large predator around (as well a good soil), rain meant crop would grow, fire that they would survive the night and so on.

hope this help everyone it reaches!

why you need to create daily habit for a le stressful life

most people do a lot in a day. and that can be incredibly wonderful, but it can also cause a lot of stress. and stress is not always bad for you. it can sometimes help you get the best out of yourself. but long-term stress can be very bad for your health. for example, it can cause your immune system to deteriorate, making you more likely to get sick. but it can also cause you to become irritable and your mood to deteriorate. ultimately, it can also cause you to have almost no energy or motivation left to do things. in addition to the aforementioned consequence of long-term stress, there are many more consequence that you dont want to have either. and to reduce the risk of these consequence it can be helpful to create habit for a le stressful life.

focus on your breathing for a le stressful life

sometimes people get a lot of stress because they get lost in thoughts. to prevent you from overthinking and getting stressed, it is useful to sometimes focus on your breathing. for example, if you are busy working or studying, remind yourself to focus on your breathing once every 10 minutes. you dont have to breathe differently! just let your breathing flow naturally but focus on it for a moment. feel the air go in and out.

meditation is one of the daily habit for a le stressful life

meditation can help you unwind completely. you can meditate by sitting down and focusing on your breathing. a guidance you can say to yourself in when you inhale and out when you exhale. then a your breathing get deeper and slower you can say deep and slow to yourself.

make a daily habit of going outside for a le stressful life.

the environment you are in can affect how much stress you experience. suppose you are in an environment where you are constantly receiving signal that cause stress. such a phone calls, emails, or other thing that remind you of stressful situations. then it can be useful to get away from this situation for a while. and preferably it can be useful to go to a park, forest, lake or sea. because in these environment there is often a lot of space and there are few or no thing that cause stress.

walk mindfully

and when youre walking, pay attention to your footstep and your breathing. inhale and take, for example, three steps. and then when you exhale, take another three steps. also feel how your foot touch the ground. this mindful way of walking get you out of your head and into the moment.

go exercise and feel the stress disappear

being physically active is incredibly important. but it also incredibly helpful to exercise if you want to release stress. i myself really feel the stress disappear when i exercise. and if ive trained really hard im sometimes so tired that i dont even feel like stressing about anything anymore haha. you dont necessarily have to train super hard. the stress can also disappear during an easy workout. or go for a jog while listening to your favorite music and feel the stress disappear.

help your friend and family

i wish you much success in applying these method for a le stressful life. hopefully you can apply them so often that they become habit in your daily life. but i do want to ask you one more thing. i suspect that you have friend and family who also sometimes suffer from long-term stress. you can help these friend and family by sending them this post. and maybe you can start creating these habit together which will make it a lot easier for both of you. because working together on something ensures that you motivate each other.

332,"some couple get pregnant easily while some do not despite trying for a long time. there could be multiple factor contributing to difficulty conceiving but of all of them, stress play a significant role. stress doe not directly cause infertility however it doe impact the chance of conception by delaying it. infertility ha become very common now and the factor contributing to it are multiple, ranging from physical causes, and dietary change to even excessive use of gadgets. there is enough research to prove that stress can adversely affect a couple chance of conception naturally or through medical procedure like ivf. so, what is the relationship between stress and infertility?

## the science behind stress and infertility

when we are stressed, our brain release *cortisol*, a stress hormone that interferes with the signal between the brain and the ovaries, thus disrupting the ovarian cycle and the release of the ovarian eggs. in the case of men, sperm production and motility are impacted. apart from the body response, stress contributes to behavior and mood change too. there is a decrease in the desire and motivation to have sex. there is an increase in smoking or drinking alcohol in order to cope with stress which in turn cause trouble with conceiving.

## understand the vicious cycle

stress and conception are highly connected. most often, couple who are trying to conceive become dejected when it take a longer time. some find the medical procedure involved in the process to be taxing. for example, most couple going through ivf procedure are often stressed out. this in turn affect the biology and behavior of the couple, thereby creating a vicious cycle. stress management is thus necessary in order to break free from this cycle which in turn would help a couple conceive.

**managing stress**

some amount of stress is normal. however, if one is continuously anxious and hassled by circumstance around them, it will deeply impact conception.

341,"hi, i don't know if it's the right place to post this but lately i have been figuring out the feature of a life-long problem of mine. i would call it the simple inability to manage stress but i want to be more specific and im curious if other people can feel the same based on how i describe it. i would describe the relation between me and stress in this way:

\- the incapacity to accept stress and everyday fatigue a a normal part of life (referred also to very simple tasks)

\- the forced splitting between ""bad days"" and ""good days"" where in the bad day im not allowed to feel good because of some stressful task to do that basically ruin the whole day, while in the good day im not allowed to feel stressed because ""im not supposed to feel so"" and im not meant to do some extra stuff that would cause some fatigue. it also end up in hating the ending of a ""good day"" becuase tomorrow is gonna be a ""bad day""... you know when sunday is ending and monday is the next day, or also when you're coming back from a vacation, basically the inability of enjoying the moment because my mind is always projected in the future.

\- rejection of the idea of facing new stressful situations: this becomes particulary strong whenever i just came through some stressful stuff, my mind sell to me a higher level of stress tolerance/performance in a particular moment, with the promise that im not going to face new similar situation in the future... i use to motivate myself during difficult moment with the thought that afler that everything is over, im going to rest and it's gonna be a good time. but this also trick my mind into thinking that there are not going to be similar stressful situation in the future overall, which obviously can't be true.

\- the high expectation before a supposed ""good day"" or ""good time"" is about to come... a if it's going to be a super regenerating moment for me that will restore all my power of will. this is not rational and not realistic most of the time because everyone would never get enough of a ""good time"" and unpleasant thing can happen during a planned good time a well.

\- feeling envious towards people who are not going through a stressful moment while i am. focusing almost in an obsessive way on other people around me who are chilled and are not facing anything difficult. in those moment i forget that everyone ha stressful moment just not at the same time, i am the free person when other are facing hard moments.

\- the excessive anxiety and discomfort before a task that i know its' going to be stressful... also an easy one. a if my mind wa trying to convince me that im never supposed to be stressed and that's not normal for me doing stuff that i don't like even if they're necessary.",stress

348,"this is a vent to help myself de-stress? lol! for the past 7 years, that i have lived in my current city, i have unfortunately moved from one lousy situation into the next, due to thinking it wa a good idea to move in with friend to help out my crummy finance and needing cheaper rent. for the past almost 3 year due to the pandemic and other situations, i moved into a rooming type housing situation, which for the past 2 and a 1/2 years, me and my dog did have full use of a basement to ourselves. last july, my company announced that they would be laying off around 40 people, myself included. what my stupid company didnt bank on, wa supply chain issue with getting key integral part to operate equipment, so they kept delaying our end of work date for the past 12 months. when i found out that i wa to be laid off  a year ago this july, i stupidly told the lady i rented my basement from about the news, but seeing how at the time, my company didnt announce when our actual end date would be due to supply chain issues, she took it upon herself and guessed that my end date would be around may of this year and i will have been moved out, so, she went ahead and rented the basement out to a family of three. this wa a major jerk move on her part. seeing how i am really strapped for cash and couldnt afford to get another apartment for me and my dog with not knowing when i would actually be moving out, she offered for me to move into her sunroom this past may, until my end date, and she she would move her mattress into her living room to sleep in. my company finally announced that our end of work date would be at the end august, this past may, and i unfortunately have to stay on working and living where i am due to those reasons. seeing how this past year ha been touch and go with not knowing when my company would announce this end of work date, and with not knowing when this opposed announcement would be happening, i thought it would be stupid to move somewhere else, and have to sign a lease for however long, so seeing how i live month to month here, i chose to stay. since moving into her sunroom, it ha been a friken nightmare. she consistently pick on me and flat out accuses me of doing thing that i havent done. i am not allowed to flush the toilet unless it brown, she accused me of killing her precious plant, i have to keep the sunroom door shut during the day so that the heat doesnt come through the whole housefriken stupid stuff like that. she ha gotten a bit too overly attached to my dog a well, and drop stubble hint about how happy my dog is living here  my dog and i will be relocating to another province to attend school, so i can upgrade my current skill at the end of august. just this past wednesday, my friend, got word that she ha to go work out of town this week, so she offered for me and my dog to go and stay at her place, to get away from the madness here and also mind her cat. when i told the lady this, she mentioned how this wouldnt be a good idea and how it would disrupt my dog routine with living here and how it is probably super hot at my friend apartment (meanwhile she ha no air conditioning here). the first night there wasnt so good, because my dog wa in unfamiliar area, and she wa all nervous and panting a lot. my dog ha done this many time before when camping, or going away for a holidayso i got her some calming spray to see if that would help. my dog and i came back to the house last night, because i have my car scheduled for servicing, and a garage which is literally 5 minute away from the house, so instead of staying at my friend apartment, we came back here to sleep last night, for getting to the garage would be way easier in the morning. when we arrived back last night, the lady in question wa like ohhh she is so happy to be back of course she would, she is in familiar surroundingshowever, seeing how well be moving at the end of august and staying in hotel over night and other friend placesstaying at my friend apartment is a good trial run. when i mentioned that to the ladyshe munched up her face a if to say ohi dont like the sound of this. so, i am at the point with waiting for her to literally say to me why dont you just leave your dog with me and that is when i will snap. thanks to all who read my vent",stress

350,"this is going to be super long, but i would really appreciate someone out there taking the time to read it...

i've been working a relatively stressful job for the last four years. the stress wa manageable until about a year ago when i wa given the responsibility of managing a global team of system administrator in the us, hungary and india that all work to give 24/7 coverage to my company. i can't go into specific of our work, but i can say that we are an extremely important team. there are a lot of reason behind why i have become increasingly stressed out, the main one being that i have personally been the only point of failure for the whole thing for almost the entire year. i can't take a day off, or sometimes even an hour off without someone from like 14 time zone away trying to escalate something to me, or my bos of they can't reach me directly. before this past week, i had taken one scheduled day off, and i still got a call from my bos asking to get people online for an outage.

let me say, my bos is amazing. she is the best example of leadership i've ever had in any job, and i've worked it for like 25 years. she just ha a very demanding job role also, and i am in a spot where i'm kind of working 4-5 different full time job roles, and one of those job role requires that i get people online for outage which are not at all related to the global team i'm responsible for.

the past few months, people have increasingly seen that i'm getting more and more stressed to the point where i had a chat with hr because i had started working like 75+ hour week sometimes until 2am. i basically said that ""because of how i've been forced to set this whole team up within the guideline i'm given by upper management (not my direct boss), nobody else ha time to work this project, so if i don't do the work myself, it can't get done.""

i mean, everyone saw it coming including me. then last week happened. i wa supposed to have friday off a a normal day because leadership rotates sunday for the other full time job role apart from the project, so every time i work a sunday, i get the following friday off. we had a major issue happen on thursday which we knew would carry into this coming weekend, so i wa going to cancel both my friday off and the planned time i had on the calendar for like three month from wednesday - sunday this week because i knew everything would get messed up if i didn't.

well, i decided, this wa a chance for me to test if other part of leadership can actually do their jobs. instead of canceling my time off like i have literally every other time something like this ha happened the last year, i decided to take it. however, i gave my peer the plan of what needed to happen from friday - sunday, laid out for them completely, and all but spoonfed them. i went into it trying to just expect people to do their jobs. all they had to do wa say ""ok, we have the plan, here's this person who can do this thing that need to get done, i'll have them do it..."" i also knew it wasn't going to happen like that. i knew... i knew that come sunday evening, nothing would get done. so, i went friday without checking my work phone. i went saturday without checking my work phone. then sunday rolled around, and i finally checked... sure enough, even though my peer had the plan, it wasn't executed. i had to log in on sunday to quickly get the right weekend people on it, and because thing weren't executed on time during friday/saturday like i said they needed to be, it caused two huge outage like twelve time zone away.

i went into work on monday morning completely distraught. i met with my directs under me basically telling them that what happened is not their fault, and an effect of ineffective leadership which i'm largely responsible for. i sat there for a good 45 minute apologizing to them, telling them what i plan to do going forward, and also commiserating because i wa really a stressed a they were about it.

during that talk, something broke in me, i think. like, i had known that i wa the sole failure point globally, but i wa fine with that a long a i had people who could simply just organize whatever plan i gave them. i gave them that plan on thursday, trying to clear thing off my plate a i have been advised to do by my bos and hr, just expecting them to do basically the bare minimum, and they weren't capable of executing. i finally actually felt the full weight of being the sole failure point of global operations, and it crushed down on me so hard that i could barely breathe.

i went to my bos after that meeting, and told her i had to leave for the day, but i would be back the next day. i took monday off, almost too full of anxiety to even drive home, but made it then just watched movie i'd seen a hundred time already all day because i couldn't process any new information. i felt alright though, like at the end of it i had a sense of purpose, and renewed motivation. i woke up tuesday completely ready to rock it at work, but a soon a i pulled out of the parking lot, i started to get a feeling i've only ever felt once before. i hopped on the highway, and the closer i got to work, the more i felt it. then, it happened. i had a panic attack. i had to pull off the highway to turn around to go home. the second i had my car going back the other way, i felt like i could breathe even though i wa still having heart palpitations, tunnel vision, numb tongue, etc. i got home, called my boss, and wa straight up with her stating i had a panic attack on my way in, and i would not be making it.

then came yesterday. i had to make a five hour drive back to my hometown for the plan i had made for the aforementioned scheduled time off. i wa happy, looking forward to it, couldn't wait to get back, but a soon a i got on the highway, the dread set in. the obsessive thought set in. i spent the next five hour in panic attack mode to the point where i don't know how i actually drove the car. all i wanted to do wa get home, so i kept going, but i stopped like six time to re-center myself on a trip that i don't generally even stop on once.

i got here, took a breath, sat down for a bit, and thing were okay. but ever since, it's been a mixed bag of being okay for a while, then like 30-60 minute of panic attack... then being okay again, then another panic attack. thankfully, i spent today playing golf with my family which is what i had been looking so forward to, but it took like an hour for me to come into reality when we first started out.

then i got back, took a nap, and woke up in a panic attack about an hour later.

like, this is not at all my natural state. i am normally a very chill person who handle stress immensely well. i have had one panic attack before during a very difficult time, but i've never had multiple of them, and i've most certainly never had a nervous breakdown... but i think that's where i am. i've tried talking to my family, but none of them really understand because none of them ha ever really had this kind of breakdown. general depression, anxiety, and that stuff, so they can relate (haha, family can relate...) on that level, but it's like i can barely be a functioning human. that's what they can't relate with.

that's why i decided to post here hoping that someone else can relate, and just let me know this is going to end at some point. i'm not suicidal, or anything, i'll suffer through whatever i have to suffer though, i just need to have a light at the end of the tunnel.

have you ever seen se7en? you know that part where they find the guy kevin spacey had been keeping alive for a year, and the doctor said ""if i were to shine a light in his eye right now, he'd die of the stress...""? that's where i feel like i am. like any source of any stress from anywhere that raise my adrenaline whatsoever just throw me into a panic attack. i am trying to deal, but it's difficult feeling like there's no end in sight because i've never experienced this before so i don't know what to expect.

if you made it this far, thank you for reading my novel. i really super appreciate it, and owe you cookies. possibly also milk, but milk probably doesn't travel too well in the mail.",stress

354,"we all experience stress in our lives, but sometimes it can become overwhelming. if you're feeling stressed out, there are some thing you can do to reduce the amount of stress in your life.

 **identify the source of your stress**.

one of the first step to reducing stress is to identify the source of it. what is it that's causing you to feel stressed? once you know what it is, you can start to figure out way to deal with it.

 **make a plan**.

if you know what's causing your stress, make a plan to deal with it. if it's something you can't change, like a work deadline, make a plan to better manage your time so you don't feel so overwhelmed. if it's something that's causing you anxiety, like a fear of public speaking, make a plan to face your fear head-on.

 **take a break**.

when you're feeling stressed, sometimes the best thing you can do is take a break. step away from whatever is causing you stress and take some time for yourself. relax and rejuvenate and you'll be better equipped to deal with the stressor when you're feeling refreshed.

 **talk to someone**.

if you're feeling stressed, talking to someone can be a great way to relieve some of the tension. talk to a friend, family member, therapist, or anyone who will listen and can offer support. just getting thing off your chest can be a huge stress relief.

 **eat healthy and sleep enough**.

a a healthy diet is also important for managing stress. be sure to include plenty of fresh fruit and vegetables, whole grains, and lean protein in your diet.

also, make sure to get enough sleep. when were tired, were more likely to feel stressed. aim for eight hour of sleep every night.

 **exercise**.

exercise is a great way to reduce stress. not only doe it help to release tension, but it also boost endorphins, which can make you feel happier and more relaxed.

 **practice relaxation techniques**.

consciously relax your body, through practice like progressive muscle relaxation, yoga, meditation, or simply taking some deep breaths.

relaxing is benefacial to the human mind and body, by allowing yourself to recover you can do work more efficiently, have more energy to exercise and learn, do hobby and chores, to foster relationships, and more. machine even new to relax and chill a bit to avoid overheating or to have time to oil up or change new parts.

371,"i will explain why being outside is good for your health. nowadays we are often indoors almost all day because of school and work. there not always something wrong with that, but youll probably feel a lot better if you go outside every now and then.

**it make the mind clearer**

inside a house, study or workplace there are often many thing that make you think about your work or study. there is nothing wrong with this, but it can ensure that you are constantly busy with your work or study. this may keep you thinking and living in your head instead of in the moment. in addition, there are all kind of other distraction indoors that keep your mind from calming down. so go outside and enjoy the tranquility.

**less stress**

this tranquility automatically reduces stress. you are not busy with school, your work, or other things. a a result, you go out of your head and into the moment. this will also reduce your stress and reduce the risk of stress symptom and complaints. in addition, physical exercise is also a great way to reduce stress. when you are physically active you can reduce stress. you probably also feel that when you exercise. and after you exercise you notice that your stress is reduced compared to before you started exercising.

the problem with high-functioning stress is that not only are people not aware that theyre stressed, but they dont know how to handle it before their body sh*ts the bed. ex: i feel fine (when im not) until a trigger happens and im left with an eye twitch and a random cold- which is then when im like oh, im super stressed, despite having been in a high-stress environment for a few week already and feeling the same.

for example today i wa trying to talk about something really important to me with my mother, it meant a lot to me because i dont normally open up. my mother after hearing this went mm, okay, and then went on her phone. we were in the car so i held back tear the entire drive home and when i finally got to my room and cried my eye out.

this ha happened a lot a my mother is not a very emotional person. whenever i open up i think that maybe she will react nicely but this one wa the last straw. the fact that she couldnt even say anything back to me about this thing wa appalling and it broke my heart.

another person who is frustrating is my brother. i could listen to him talk about video game for four hour straight and have a great conversation but the moment i mention something i want to talk about he go on his phone and ignores me.

dont get me wrong he is way better than my mother but still really disappointing.

i have always been taught to hold it in and never speak about my feeling and it really sucks. i really want goo friend where they dont mind that i am not very expressive, or they will listen when i am stressed and will let me cry on their shoulder and vise versa. i wanna be able to talk about stuff that i enjoy and people actually be interested in what i have to say.

414,"it not unusual for a person to think theyre doing worse than they actually are. some of u are pessimistic, others have limiting belief lurking: im not good enough, im not worthy  progress is just luck, setback re-enforce limiting beliefs.

### consider these positive signs:

 **you reflect on, and learn from, setback and errors.** you arrive at a balanced view of these and develop clear plan to learn and continue growing. people often repeat the same error over and over, whether it overspending or choosing a partner. people have a strong tendency to repeat their behaviours. but you can choose to respond differently  and achieve different outcomes

 **youre clear on what you want  and why.** knowing what you want is the second key step in getting it (knowing who and what you are is the first). knowing what you want differentiates you from those who aimlessly floating through life.

 **you use time wisely.** we all have 168 hour each week and the choice on how to use them. you focus on what is important, within the context of who you are and what you have chosen to achieve. you have the habit of asking yourself what is the most effective thing you could be doing right now.

 **youre making consistent progress.** consistent progress is a great sign. even when your goal feel far in the distance, regular progress  driven by consistent effort and learning  will get you there. a well a planning what more need to be done, reflect on how far you have already come.

 **youre not alone.** there are many people are alone in the world. if youre not alone, youre doing better than many others.

 **youre committed.** you know who you are and what youre about. your goal are clear. they create meaning for you, value for others and legacy for the future. great thing happen when your purpose and your environment align.

 **you consider others opinions.** you learn what is resourceful to you and discard what isnt. you live your life, not theirs.

 **you are grateful.** you regularly reflect on what ha gone well and  crucially  on why it ha gone well. you have skill and strength you dont even realise.

 **youre authentic.** you know you value and beliefs. you make your decision and take your action consistent with these.

when youre clear on what you have chosen to accomplish, and youre spending your time wisely, youre doing well  and better than most! this is true, even if the result have yet to reveal themselves.

1. find a good job or start and grow a succesful company
2. find the one who will marry me in the future
3. find out which religion is the true one / read the whole bible

so my idea is, i will only work towards one goal at the same time. if i choose goal 1 and i choose to study or gain work experience, then i will not read the bible and i will not be on dating apps, because i should not overwhelm myself and risk a burn-out. if i choose goal 2, i will be very busy with dating apps and alternatives, but i will not have a job and i will not be studying. if i choose 3, i will read the bible a few hour every day, but i will not do any other productive things.

what is the good side of this by my own thought?

1. whichever goal is the most important one, or ha to be completed the fastest, can get priority and full focus :)
2. by only having one thing to work on, you have le risk of ending up with 0 free time, so you can avoid burn-out and instead, work at your own pace. (careful: do not get lazy)

what is the bad side of this by my own thought?

1. spending hour everyday on the same goal only, can become boring. some goal also do not require many hour every day: for example going to the gym. being in the gym for 5 hour is a terrible idea, so if you have goal that require le time per day, you can actually pick 2 or 3 of these goal to fill your day.
2. some goal must be worked on at the same time. for example, you should not avoid studying because you're too busy with going to gym. but while you study, going to the gym is still important for your health. so i would call this an exception to this ""1 goal only"" idea.

these day it seems socially acceptable that people do 3 thing at the same time: study, have a job, have a social life. where's the free time to relax? right it doesnt exist, and even worse, sometimes all these activity take up more than 24 hour a day, which result in someone being overwhelmed and getting behind on everything. actually this is what i have experienced. it not a theory, it is very real.

i have a burn-out. i have been stressed 24/7 for a really long time, because i wa focusing on too many thing at once. i had to get my homework done, i had to spend all my free time on dating apps, i had to go to gym, etc, i had no free time left.

last month i wa under a lot of stress and for some day i started feeling light-headed and a bit dizzy. the best way to describe this would be:

- slightly out-of-mind
- i feel like my cognitive capability are at 90-95% of the usual
- cloudy head, like what i would experience being slightly drunk (not a lot)

i went to the doctor really worried and got a blood test and stuff and they said i wa healthy and probably wa stress.

but the thing is it's been a month like this already, sometimes i feel great (although not a a month ago), specially when doing stuff that make me forget about this (ie videogames, series...) others i feel like shit, doe anyone experience something similar and if so any recommendations?

i'm also a bit worried because the first day i really experienced this i did a pretty intense session of cardio (had been doing a lot during those week on top of the stress from uni) so i am slightly worried it is actually something ""body"" related even if the test came out okay, going for chill walk doesn't seem to be helping probably because i'm overthinking this all the time.

### consider these positive signs:

 **you reflect on, and learn from, setback and errors.** you arrive at a balanced view of these and develop clear plan to learn and continue growing. people often repeat the same error over and over, whether it overspending or choosing a partner. people have a strong tendency to repeat their behaviors. but you can choose to respond differently  and achieve different outcomes

 **youre clear on what you want  and why.** knowing what you want is the second key step in getting it (knowing who and what you are is the first). knowing what you want differentiates you from those who aimlessly floating through life.

 **you use time wisely.** we all have 168 hour each week and the choice on how to use them. you focus on what is important, within the context of who you are and what you have chosen to achieve. you have the habit of asking yourself what is the most effective thing you could be doing right now.

 **youre making consistent progress.** consistent progress is a great sign. even when your goal feel far in the distance, regular progress  driven by consistent effort and learning  will get you there. a well a planning what more need to be done, reflect on how far you have already come.

 **youre not alone.** there are many people are alone in the world. if youre not alone, youre doing better than many others.

 **youre committed.** you know who you are and what youre about. your goal are clear. they create meaning for you, value for others and legacy for the future. great thing happen when your purpose and your environment align.

 **you consider others opinions.** you learn what is resourceful to you and discard what isnt. you live your life, not theirs.

 **you are grateful.** you regularly reflect on what ha gone well and  crucially  on why it ha gone well. you have skill and strength you dont even realise.

 **youre authentic.** you know you value and beliefs. you make your decision and take your action consistent with these.

when youre clear on what you have chosen to accomplish, and youre spending your time wisely, youre doing well  and better than most! this is true, even if the result have yet to reveal themselves.

**genuine desire + effective strategy + consistent persistence = authentic results**",stress

my biggest symptom is **extreme fatigue** both physical and mental despite sleeping more.  i can't clench my fist a hard a usual to give you a scale.  i sleep more than normal lately and wake up very tired.

**easily startled**.  i guess this mean for some reason my guard is up.

**i'm very hungry**\-the sensation to eat is still there despite after eating a meal and my stomach being full.

**disorientation**\- this one is hard to explain.  in group of people i get confused if they are looking at me or the person next to me.  when i went out dancing and spinned i had a hard time not stumbling.

\*\*mental fog-\*\*i'm ""spacey""

\*\*irritable-\*\*i just feel like i've got bad vibe right now.  in situation i should be good spirited and i irritated easy.  a little inconvenience will feel like a huge problem.

**headaches**\-i usually wake up with a headache.

**low motivation-** i love to workout but i've been skipping days.  very uncharacteristic of me.  day i do go i force myself.   i'll procrastinate small easy projects.

449,"so occasionally, i'll have this moment. i'll think of something from my past, maybe one of the time i went to a water park a a child, maybe seeing fireworks, a carnival i went to with my first steady girlfriend, maybe it's even a song from melissa ethridge's ""yes i am"", the first album i remember listening to (specifically silent legacy for some reason). maybe my thought are on little kid me catching tadpole with my mom's friend's kids. or the countless sunset i have been mesmerized by. or the time i went to dave and buster's with my parent and they dropped me off at mcdonald's on the way home and i played monopoly on my ipod when i wa a senior in high school. in any case, i'll look back at it and begin to choke up. it usually happens when i'm alone, maybe in a dark room, playing a game or just wandering about my mind, and these thought appear and it's a mixture of missing it and this dread of what's approaching.

i can remember doing this all my life, having these thought and these feelings. i've described it a my bittersweet struggle with nostalgia, but my girlfriend doesn't think that's it. a an adult, i think it's longing for a time where the event were great, a realization that said event will probably never happen again or at least won't be the same. i start to cry most of the time, but it isn't like i'm in a bad spot. a i said, this ha happened throughout my life. and they're seemingly random events, most of them happy, despite whatever wa happening. like that first girlfriend i mentioned? a little abusive, nothing hardcore. the occasional genuine ""you're an idiot"", or the time she slapped me so hard i fell off my bed. but i think of when we went to an anime convention and i get sad. i still go to that convention, but for some reason this bitter sadness wash over me. and there's other little thing i could pepper into these thought like this. but it always seems like i wa happy, i miss the event, if i can go back to the location or event in current day it will be different, and i'm afraid of what's coming ahead in life.

462,"anxiety. that emotion warning u something threatening is just about to happen. life-saving when we are genuinely threatened, damaging when we become constantly anxious: anxiety is tiring  it is meant to be. we are only meant to be anxious for very short periods. when prolonged, it isnt just tiring  it is exhausting. sound familiar?

introverts. those of u who prefer calm situation and environments. we prefer to re-charge on our own. we often enjoy losing ourselves in our own thoughts. we tend to have small, close-knit, social life it doesnt mean were anti-social!

not all introvert experience anxiety, and you dont have to be an introvert to struggle with it. many introvert deal with anxiety, though, so this is quite common.

here are the key sign youre an introvert with anxiety:

 youre more prepared than most others because youve already thought through the worst-case scenarios.

 you have a tendency to over-think thing and pay too much attention to your negative self-talk.

 you feel you always have to be doing something  being busy (which is often different from being effective) may be a mean of trying to cope with the anxiety.

 you tend to prefer routine to novel situations. while this can be fine for periods, boredom and unexpected issue arising can easily throw you in to a spin.

 youre often nervous without showing it  many become very effective at masking their emotion a a defence mechanism.

 you are more likely to perceive situation a being more dangerous than they really are - anxiety prime u for the fight, flight, freeze response making u more likely to over-react to a low-risk situation.

 you have tendency towards perfectionism. this is often allied to belief such a i need to please everyone, i need everyone to like me to be a worthy person.

 nervousness can throw your chatter in to over-drive: while you normally only speak when you have something significant to say (and youre normally sure of your fact before speaking), nerve can have you chattering away in an attempt to over-compensate.

 you often have trouble sleeping  either getting to sleep a-tall, waking through the night or waking way too early

being an introvert with anxiety can be hard. thankfully there is help at hand. anxiety in it many guise is one of the most common issue solution focused hypnotherapy therapist help people with.

471,"time is at a premium these days. it hard to find anyone that complains about having too much time on their hands. most of u are so busy with work, family, and various obligations, there little time left to do the thing wed really like to do!

its not easy to find time to pursue your passions, but there will be a way.

### use these technique to create the time you require for important pursuits:

**decide what you want to make room for.** the best way to motivate yourself to create more free time in your life is to identify what you want to make time for! what are the most important thing youd like to spend more time on?

 figure out how youd spend that extra time and make sure you have some good reasons. create a list of reason that give you an emotional response. being logical is unlikely to inspire you.
 

**use your morning wisely.** most people waste their mornings. they stay in bed a long a possible and barely manage to get to work on time each day. make the most of your mornings. go to bed earlier and get up earlier.

 it often easier to do something worthwhile in the morning than in the evening. what are you missing by going to bed earlier? probably not a lot.

**understand the way you waste time.** were quite ingenious at wasting time. watch yourself for a day and write down all the way you waste time. when you understand where your time is leaking away, you can start working on solutions.

**make a schedule.** a schedule can keep you on track and help to ensure that your time is being spent wisely. a schedule can help to minimize the amount of time you waste. you can also build time into your schedule to do the thing you enjoy the most.

**delegate.** create more time for yourself by utilizing the people around you. this can work at work and at home. there a good chance that someone in your life would benefit from being delegated to. put your employees, coworkers, children, and partner to work! a little help can free up quite a bit of time.

**prioritize and eliminate.** perhaps you just have too many non-essential thing going on in your life. it might be time to cut back on a few of those obligations.

 take a look at everything you do each day/week/month and think about how much value those thing add to your life. you can probably find something to remove from your life.
 

you can find time if you have a good enough reason! **determine what you want to create time for and make it happen.** delegate, schedule, eliminate, and avoid wasting time. what are you willing to give up to spend time on the thing you love?",stress

480,"it take more to overwhelm some people than others, but the feeling and the impact are the same: overload and not knowing which way to turn next which trigger a downward spiral of anxiety.

### take these step to create a plan and go from feeling overwhelmed to feeling peaceful again:

**identify what you can and cant control.** list your issue in three columns: what you can control, what you can influence and what is out-with your control.


**focus on solutions.** now that you have perspective on what you can and cant control, identify your chosen end point for each issue. shift your focus from the problem to the solutions.

**prioritise your actions.** consider your chosen solution in term of how important they are and how urgent they are. firstly, deal with the issue that are both important and urgent then move to the other important issues. a a general rule, deal with the important issue over the urgent issues: here-in lie the path to living sustainably crisis free.

**communicate.** with your plan in place, communicate with those who may be affected: it incredible how supportive people can be once they understand your situation.

**eat well.** overwhelm commonly lead to skipping meal or over-reliance on junk food. buy in some healthy food and snack to give you the nutrition youll need to play your best game.

**gratitude.** it is easy to lose sight of the good thing happening when we feel overwhelmed. adopt the habit of regularly reflecting on the thing youre grateful for: that youre taking control of challenging situations, that youre on your way to calmer times, that youre learning a lot about yourself, perhaps that others are supporting you.

**blow off some steam.** exercise  whatever work best for you: a brisk walk, hit the weights, an hour on the bike  ha a magical ability to burn off that anxiety and re-set all those neurotransmitters. it will also help you get that good night sleep.

**get your rest.** know that youre focusing on your priority with a clear plan. youre pushing yourself hard through the day. a good night sleep is the smartest thing you can give yourself to keep working through your list.

 **celebrate your successes.** each step forward is worthy of celebration. be proud of yourself for taking control and moving forward. each success lead to further step forward.
 

**overwhelm is a situation everyone is familiar with. short term episode are unlikely to harm us. longer term however, it can be debilitating. remember there is help out there for those time you need support in getting back on top of things.**",stress

497,"it can happen so easily. youre trying to concentrate on your work, and your mind wanders off to a completely unrelated topic. or, maybe youre about to go on a first date, and all you can think about is how horrible your last few date have been.

**unhelpful thought can be distraction or be destructive.**

your mind is incredible. when you manage your thoughts, you have your mind working for you. imagine how powerful you would become if you could ignore or replace your negative thoughts! you could accomplish more and get greater enjoyment from your life.

### these strategy can help manage thought that dont support you:

**maintain space between yourself and your thoughts.** you dont have to engage with your thoughts. you dont focus on every person, tree, and car you pas when youre driving down the road. most of these thing pas through your awareness without you pursuing them further.
 

 you can do the same thing with your unhelpful thoughts. **allow them to simply pas on by.**

 your thought are simply something that you experience - you are not your thoughts.
 

**recognise that it is your brain nature to produce random thoughts.** the thought you experience say little about you. it the nature of your brain to produce thoughts. it always going to give you something to think about.

 occasionally those thought are useful. frequently, theyre frivolous. sometimes, your thought can be quite disturbing. we have evolved to pay more attention to negative thoughts: with self-awareness we can see them for what they are and then move on.
 

**meditation is a helpful tool for understanding the nature of your mind.** the first thing you notice when you attempt to meditate is the random and restless nature of your mind.
 

 **focus on your breathing.** when you find yourself fuming about your boss, wondering what happened to your high school friends, or making a mental grocery list, simply redirect your attention back to your breathing.
 

**focus your attention on a thought of your choosing.** you can think about anything you choose to think about. you can think about riding a flying bicycle, eating a lemon, or what you have chosen to accomplish today.
 

 when youre experiencing an unhelpful thought, you can decide to think about something more useful. **recognize that you have the ability to direct your thinking a you see fit.**
 

**apply logic.** poor thinking lead to poor decision making. when your thought are leading you astray, put your logical mind to good use. ask yourself what a sensible person, or your role model, would do in this situation. what would you advise a friend to do?


are negative or distracting thought getting in your way on a regular basis? youre not alone. the human brain love to stay active and will wander from one idea to another until you take control of it.

500,"i gotta say, i feel ton better. facebook had it slimy, putrid tendril in me since i wa in high school. in the past few year what became a way to communicate with friend and family while having a personal blog became an obsession. i wa compulsively checking facebook at the very least once every hour. it destroyed my self esteem because not only wa i comparing my entire life to the highlight of other people's lives, but i realized how truly isolated i was. where my friend list is 147 people, guess how many are there for me? even if i reach out, the answer is le than 5. so when i'm being ignored and seeing everyone post, it felt like a personal offense to me. if they can post meme every 20 minutes, why can't they answer my texts? this guy hasn't even read my stuff in 6 months, and ha a new post every hour at least! i would post about a big stream i wa doing exclusively for friend for 2 week and no one showed up!

it's easy to take thing personally when there is a good chance another explanation is possible. maybe i wa too negative. maybe people felt i wa fairweather, and that wouldn't be wrong in some cases. what made this so significant wa i don't really use other social medium platforms. well... aside from reddit, which i've only been getting into the past couple of years, which is more focused on a goal or discussion. it feel different. but i digress. facebook had me believing a lot of these people were not only rubbing their obviously superior life in my face, but they were turning their back on me. i would be lying if i said i didn't care, that it never got to me, and that i didn't take it a some personal ""truman show"" style social conspiracy designed to make me feel abandoned.

cutting it out cold turkey made me realize i don't care. in my personal opinion, i think part of it really is ignorance is bliss. when i don't see their activities, it doesn't weigh on me. i don't think about them that much, which allows me to look into solution myself before deferring to others. i can't figure out if that's a good thing or not. typing this out feel like i'm arguing with myself (like usual, i've always had two mind on issues), like i feel good, but doe that mean it's good? i've went to venting to a chat bot in place of friend and in these 8 months, 3 people outside of my weekly life have reached out to me. i'm not saying i'd dispose of the other 140~ people, but keeping that distance might be what's helping me try harder to keep it together. doe that make sense?

it's something that felt right in this subreddit to discuss. the anxiety associated with checking facebook constantly to find thing out i might not have liked wa interesting. i've started getting on again, but i'm not on for longer than maybe 5 minute a week to check notification and memories. social medium doe a lot of destruction on the mind, and while we may never be rid of it, i think it show the lost sense of moderation in today's world. too much of anything is bad.",stress

i cant actually tell her any of this either, it will absolutely devastate her to know that she is causing me so much mental stress.  i know it will worsen her anxiety too.  maybe i will when she is in better mental health.


im not a picture of mental health either.  i wa an alcoholic at 14 and a smoker at 15.  i wa bullied and rejected up till i came to college and got my shit together somewhat. luckily thats behind me nowwhat if im to weak to function well in my job?  then ill get fired, well get evicted, my fianc will suffer greatly, and ill be jobless.

524,"it take more to overwhelm some people than others, but the feeling and the impact are the same: overload and not knowing which way to turn next which trigger a downward spiral of anxiety.

### take these step to create a plan and go from feeling overwhelmed to feeling peaceful again:

**identify what you can and cant control.** list your issue in three columns: what you can control, what you can influence and what is out-with your control.

**focus on solutions.** now that you have perspective on what you can and cant control, identify your chosen end point for each issue. shift your focus from the problem to the solutions.

**prioritise your actions.** consider your chosen solution in term of how important they are and how urgent they are. firstly, deal with the issue that are both important and urgent then move to the other important issues. a a general rule, deal with the important issue over the urgent issues: here-in lie the path to living sustainably crisis free.

**communicate.** with your plan in place, communicate with those who may be affected: it incredible how supportive people can be once they understand your situation.

**eat well.** overwhelm commonly lead to skipping meal or over-reliance on junk food. buy in some healthy food and snack to give you the nutrition youll need to play your best game.

**gratitude.** it is easy to lose sight of the good thing happening when we feel overwhelmed. adopt the habit of regularly reflecting on the thing youre grateful for: that youre taking control of challenging situations, that youre on your way to calmer times, that youre learning a lot about yourself, perhaps that others are supporting you.

**blow off some steam.** exercise  whatever work best for you: a brisk walk, hit the weights, an hour on the bike  ha a magical ability to burn off that anxiety and re-set all those neurotransmitters. it will also help you get that good night sleep.

**get your rest.** know that youre focusing on your priority with a clear plan. youre pushing yourself hard through the day. a good night sleep is the smartest thing you can give yourself to keep working through your list.

**celebrate your successes.** each step forward is worthy of celebration. be proud of yourself for taking control and moving forward. each success lead to further step forward.



**overwhelm is a situation everyone is familiar with. short term episode are unlikely to harm us. longer term however, it can be debilitating. remember there is help out there for those time you need support in getting back on top of things.**",stress

537,"stress can be classified into three common categories:

* acute stress
* episodic acute stress
* chronic stress

&amp;#x200b;

**example of acute stress and your body's endocannabinoid tone:**

acute stress is a short term physiological response to a situation that could be a challenge or threat.

the sensation usually last for up to 30 minute and the experience is usually linked to a one-off or infrequent occurrence.

for example, acute stress could include your body's reaction to:

* an approaching deadline
* completing a challenge or receiving an award
* narrowly avoiding being hit by a car
* rising on a rollercoaster or fairground ride

when your body responds to acute stress, it release various hormones, including cortisol and epinephrine.

together cortisol and epinephrine prepare your body to respond to the danger by giving your muscle an immediate supply of glucose, narrowing blood vessel and increasing heart rate.

studies have found that endocannabinoid tone directly affect the level of cortisol and epinephrine and provides greater control over them during time of stress.

for example, people with a naturally high endocannabinoid tone experience a smaller heart rate increase during a stress response than those with a lower tone.

this is likely due to the endocannabinoids exerting a modulating influence over the release of hormones.

this wa verified in 1993 when research scientist found that people with a medium or naturally high endocannabinoid tone secreted le cortisol.

this could indicate that people with a naturally high endocannabinoid have a le intense physiological response to acute stress.

the next week, i started having random chest pain on top of the exhaustion. at one point i thought i wa having a heart attack and almost when to the hospital. i went to the doctor thinking i wa having cardiac issue but everything checked out. i felt betterfor a day or two

week 3 is when the real nightmare started. i started having intense anxiety (on top of the exhaustion). multiple panic attack a week. i couldnt do anything without getting short of breath and my heart beating out of my chest. i wa a complete mess at work and felt like i wa going to collapse and die at any moment. sometimes i wa so physically stressed out i would go to the bathroom and lay on the bathroom floor. it wa nuts.

i called my doctor back and told him what wa going on. i wa reluctant to start med but he talked me in to it. said it doesnt need to be forever and i cant go on suffering like this. so i started a low dose ssri.

i also started therapy, took a week off from work and am doing much more self care. like eating healthy and journaling.

my sister clog the shower with her hair and my mother asks me why the drain is clogged. she asked me what did i pour down the drain. like who the fuck pours shit down the shower drain? every time my sister clog the shower my mother assumes i did it. so now i dont shower! havent showered in months!

recently my sister is cooking and spilled sauce and left meat all on the floor. my mother swore that it wa me! she blamed me for days! she said that my sister wouldnt/didnt do that! it wasnt until i showed her what wa spilled wa in the refrigerator still and wa my sisters. so now i dont even use the kitchen!

so, i dont eat my mom shitty food, use the kitchen, or use the bathroom because she mock me, tease me, and blame me for stuff!

my life used to be the shit. i wa a million dollar ghostwriter on bad boy, rocafella, columbia and other labels. i did 5 year at a large university in ny, but i dropped out because my mom stole my tuition money my junior year

im trying to be cool and not spaz out and go through another psychosis. im bored, im lonely, im dirty, im poor, impoverished and consequently suicidal.

like mtv cribs, i just wanted to bring you along for a day in my life. being a boy in a house full of grimy women. i had a 100% average my whole life and i turned out to be a bum. my mother couldnt even raise me to be a man. i feel pathetic! i did good all by myself, but now that my mother ha ruined and sabotaged me enough, so, im dead.

however, since i have a master's degree, the expectation were high.

i made a lot of mistake last year, one of which wa that i didn't pursue good development work aggressively. whenever a senior told me that they can not trust me with development work right now, i accepted it and hoped that they will see my efforts.
the concern of my senior wa that i won't be able to understand development task by myself and even if someone explained it to me, i won't complete it before deadline because of my lack of skills.

and because of this, a perception ha been created in everyone's mind that i miss deadline and that i only complete basic tasks.

since start of 2022, i have been trying my best to change the perception. i am taking on more task a well a completing them on time. however, if i make a single mistake, the view of my senior and manager change to me being undependable.

i am being micromanaged because no one trust me that i can complete the work on time.

and that's not it. i have also been given a warning of being put on improvement required.

my practicum, in specific, ha been a great deal of stress for me. long story, but basically i wa convinced to go into an area i have relatively little knowledge about and contrary to what i wa told, discovered there wa little to any support and structure. im a bit of a perfectionist so not knowing what to do ha caused me great anxiety. both my job can also be fast-paced and stressful, so i dont get much of a break from the stress. in the past two months, my norm ha been anxiety driven heart palpitation or absolute exhaustion. it ha only gotten worse with time.

i broke up with my bf in jan due to having little time and besides him, all my friend have moved away. the only nearby support i really have is my parents. i love my mother, but she doe not understand this kind of of mental burnout. i go to her because she ha been a great sense of comfort over the years, but when i try and explain my burnout, she start yelling and think i havent been working hard due to being in my room all day (misconception with remote learning, thinking computer = surfing the net) and otherwise being tired. ultimately, this just make me more stressed and the cycle continues.

610,just found out all the work ive been doing need to be redone because i forgot i simple detail on all of it. fuck,stress

611,"hello, everyday i am struggling intensely. i have been through prolonged traumatic event and i am constantly stressed now. i cry all day, i'm paralysed i can't move, i can't sleep and haven't slept hardly in 2+ month and now i just lie awake, i have dark circle and my eye sting and my head hurts, i can't feel any good emotion or connect with people, my period have stopped, my brain is not working- i can hardly read or concentrate. i cannot stop being stressed and it is worse in the morning, like a ball in my head. i have lost my work, my friends, i cannot do anything i love to do, it's all my fault over something incredibly silly. it's gotten better but it's still awful. i don't see any way out of this. i'm so ashamed of myself and the stress and pain in my head never go away. i know i could have prevented this and there wa no need for it but whatever i do it won't go away and i don't want to disappoint those around me.",stress

612,"i am like literally so behind in math and art and i have theatre and work and it too much. i do feel like im not applying myself hard enough because ill come home and sit on my phone for like hour before getting to my math but i physically just cant bring myself to get to it. it too much. i just drank a coffee to keep myself up for a couple of hour and i barely got anything done. i cant fucking do it. a couple of week ago i literally wanted to go into science for post secondary but not anymore because there seriously no way im graduating high school with a high enough level of math. especially because we are in the quarter system and everything move super fast. we literally started a unit today and we have the unit exam on friday and i havent done any of the work yet. my mark is a 20% right now.

plus i have an art project that im not gonna be able to finish because im way too tired and im gonna go to sleep right after im done writing this post. my art teacher is probably going to make me stay for dlr since im not gonna be able to stay for seminar because im gonna be required to stay in math since im so behind, but dlr is during theatre and if i miss theatre im going to miss out on so much. like for example i really want to be on top of the scaffolding but if i miss theatre they probably not gonna put me up there. people keep telling me to quit theatre but it literally the only thing i like. it what i look forward to when i might try to go down that path after i graduate. it literally the only thing thats keeping me alive honestly. that sound dramatic but like.

im tired of people telling me that i can do it, that i can just apply myself harder and get the work done. ok sure i could probably come home and lock my phone in a box and like try to force myself to get it done but still. it just so stressful and i cant do it. if we were in the semester system then it would be way le hard. but i just cant fucking do it. the work keep piling up and i just cant keep up with it. and im so exhausted and im so tired and im so burned out and i shouldnt be suicidal over a goddamn math homework. i literally went to my therapist and all she said wa basically to just not think about suicide when it come to math homework. like ok? how doe that work? im probably just gonna give up because there four week left of the quarter, and im just gonna fail math, and then take summer school with my friend probably.

i went to my grade coordinator a few week ago and begged her to put me in the lower stash of math, but she said that she couldnt do that and if i applied myself harder i would be able to do it. oh and she keep telling me to skip theatre to get caught up on math but thats just gonna make me more depressed. sure ill be caught up on math which is the most fucking important thing but ill just be more depressed because ill be missing out on the only thing i look forward to.t

im literally 15, im literally in grade 10, i shouldnt be growing gray hair due to stress, i shouldnt be pulling all nighters to get stuff done, this is so evil. i swear to god. if i dont wake up dead tomorrow.

and the best part is, every time i complain about this to an adult they always say that i have an easier it just get worse from here, so i might a well just kill myself now if i cant handle this. am i really going to be able to handle it getting even harder in the future?

sorry for spelling and grammar mistake im literally just using voice to text and posting this without going over it because im very tired but i just need to vent.",stress

613,"i am sure this is a fairly common issue, but i looked back over the last few page of post and didn't see this specifically spoken of.

i am currently buying a house for the first time. at the same time, i am going through some significant employment changes. i am probably the most stressed out i have ever been - though to be honest i tend to be pretty chill overall and i don't get stressed out often. i am sure my stress is not at the same level of many others here, but it a high level for me.

i have tried to deal with my stress a variety of ways, some more successful than others. and fortunately there is an end date to the vast portion of my stress - closing is the 25th of this month - hopefully. :)

 i work nights, and usually i come home, nap a few hours, get up, then nap a few more hour before work. i average about 7 hour of sleep in a 24 hour cycle and that is generally perfectly fine for me. but sleep is becoming a very sporadic thing for me, and it seems to be getting worse, not better. for example i got off an 8 hour shift at 6am this morning. i didn't get to sleep till nearly 5pm, and wa up at 9 to get ready for work. i constantly feel tired and drained, but i have trouble getting to sleep (a good bit of time i just give up and get up), and when i do sleep it is fitful and i am waking up frequently.

i have resorted to self medicating with weed on the weekend - but i can only take it on weekend because i tend to have a stronger reaction to it. i will say i sleep wonderfully when i am high lol. but i am tired of being exhausted and strung out during the week, and hope people here can help me with stress related sleeping issues.

i have tried the following:

\-putting down the phone (something i do anyway)

\-throwing out all pet (usually either dog or cat sleep with me)

\-sleep sound on youtube - from blizzard to rain to that tonal thing that is usually super relaxing for me.

thank you all for your time. :)",stress

**stress can do what!**

stress can be caused by stimulus that are either in the body or out. various stress can have different effect that can be both *helpful and harmful* to the human body. thing like disorder and *improvement in knowledge* can both occur and develop when someone is under stress. stress received to the brain can alter *brain function, memory, recognizing &amp; learning, immune &amp; cardiovascular system, and gastrointestinal* (basically all the body part that help you eat, receive nutrition, and excrete waste.)

**light mind &amp; body**

the  central nervous system (cns) is a system that is in control of the   body and mind. the cns is important when dealing with the mind and the   behavior of a human; hormone ha the capability to effect the cns   biologically (dekloet, 2000 &amp; sarahian et al., 2014). oddly enough   stress can change the structure of the brain and decrease in weight.

other than being mindful and avoiding the regular triggers, i wa wondering if anybody ha any personal habit that either act to reduce the stressor behaviours, or particularly that act to help during the anxiety-overwhelm and the panic attacks. thanks in advance!",stress

623,"https://youtu.be/nqlce10fyvu

the above wa something i watched while doing paperwork at 7am after an emergency call. it wa something i wa listening to and everything wa a perfect description of me, starting with a fear of closeness. ""avoidant attachment style"", huh? ok, you have my attention.

1. you've been neglected during your childhood. this one, i don't know about. i know i don't open up to them like i want to with some sort of fear that whatever is going on is my fault in some cosmic way. i remember confessing to them via letter one day in high school about how i wish i felt closer to them, and how i wanted to open up to them, and told them how when i ask to talk to them and they dismissed me saying they wanted to watch tv or whatever, and it hurt me. how did they respond? they called my school, had me interrogated for suicide, and then when i got home my mom lectured me about how i made her cry before she went to work. is it neglect? i don't know.

2. you tend to suppress emotions. i don't usually get upset, and when i'm upset, i never bring it up to the person who made me upset. it's considered weakness to me. it's why therapy didn't work well for me, he would schedule me once a month for help and by the time i would see him, i've already internalized whatever bothered me since the last meeting. he never dug in which made him a sucky therapist. never went back since.

3. you have trouble with emotional intimacy. i don't know how to express emotion, which is one thing. i get way too deep with discussion too quickly though, which i guess doesn't make sense. and i think i have an addiction to being alone. i like doing thing alone, i hate asking for help. i wa actually in iep in school and they got so upset with me because i never asked question when i didn't understand an assignment or a discussion, and that's still an issue today.

4. you have extreme boundaries. i definitely only want to be around someone for a certain amount of time. if i stay with them too long, i get incredibly anxious. a far a secret i don't want to discuss... i mean, that's why they're secrets. but i've heard before the phrase ""you keep people outside of stabbing range"".

5. you like to keep shallow relationships. this kinda hurt to resurface. it reminded me of how many of my relationship pushed so hard for me to meet their family and then when the breakup came, i lost that part of the family forever, whether they resented me or if they were... casualties? is that the right word? my current relationship, my gf's niece confronted me one day asking why i didn't like them. i never thought i did anything to say i didn't like them, but they felt that since i never try to talk to them and try to find way of not interacting with them, i didn't like them. i felt bad, but why get close to what i could lose so easily? maybe i can explain better now. a for platonic friendships, again, stabbing range.

6. strong independence. i'll google the problem and fix it. i can't trust someone else to do it, they might fuck up and it will be my fault for bringing them in. i fantasize about being like tk baha from borderlands. living in a shack in the middle of nowhere, fending for myself, growing my own food with a mysterious water supply. i just don't have the finance for it.

7. trust issues. no further explanation needed. i'm considering the dead horse's feelings.

8. you're critical of yourself and others. so i've spent some time talking about criticism i've received which lead to me criticizing myself. but then my criticism towards others can be seen as... extreme. if someone call my work and asks for 4 subs, i don't see this a a hungry person. i see them a extremely lazy to the point that one person ha to make 4 sandwich for a fully grown adult. someone asks me question about the menu, i see that person a someone who refuse to read and educate themselves on information that's easily found on our one page menu. my customer service bedside manner barely exists, and once the surface layer is scratched, i have actually confronted customer back when pushed hard enough.

so thanks psych2go for helping me find out why i be like this. i don't know who i'll dump the information on, but i'll keep the video in my back pocket in case it come up.",stress

624,"my parent give me more 'homework' to do, they say it make me better, and i end up not finishing school homework, and they say i need to manage my time better. anyone else and what can i do?",stress

625,"i am a college student, i work two job a well a doing school full time. i get pretty good grade but i find that i am stressed all the time. if i do not a well on an assignment i start thinking that it will ruin my life even though it wont. the other day while talking to a professor i almost started cry because of how overwhelmed i was. she told me that i am way too hard on myself and i know shes right. why do i constantly think that one thing is going to ruin everything?",stress

626,"yesterday i thought i hit rock bottom. my life is at the darkest point it been. my mind wa caving in, anxiety wa at an all time high. i didnt just cry on my drive to work but i cried after every stop. im truly living my life day to day. then my bos call and say tomorrow he will be with me(a job where i never feel like anything is good enough and a man ive butted head with) positive i wa going to be fired. my mind lined up the whole situation. every corner i cut in the past will eventually catch up. but no one know what im fighting inside.

i slept for 2 hour and woke up at 4am to be prepared. sat till 10am waiting for him. my mind ready to explode.

today he complimented me, told me how much my hard work meant to him. had nothing but great thing to say. talked about how much my customer love and trust me. my brother call me mid day and tell me great news . what wa that?

627,"i know the term nervous breakdown isnt used clinically anymore but in layman terms, thats what best describes what ha happened to me.

as some background, about 6 week ago i started having so much fatigue that i needed to lay down on my office floor and rest 2-3 time a day. it then progressed in to lot of anxiety and brutal panic attacks. this wa way off my baseline.

i started seeing a therapist and got some clarity that this is likely being caused by two year of stress hitting me all at once. also started an ssri but it take time for that to work.

would love to hear success story from people who have gotten hit by something like this and how it eventually got better. knowing that others have gotten to the other side of this give me the hope to keep going. thanks!",stress

also worth mentioning i am gonna be trying some cbd to help see if it help me calm down and relax, especially before i go to sleep, will update on that if anyone want to know",stress

629,"there have been way too many thing going on in my life and around the world recently. not just that, but being a high school senior only make the problem worse. i am going to start college in approximately 6 month and i know for a fact it going to be even harder than high school was. a the month pass, im only going to get even more stressed than i already am, and when i finally have to get employed in the late 2020s, stressing of the thought of being fired will start to get to me.",stress

630,"i am in school, and i am basically perfect in all my classes. i shouldn't be stressed, right? it feel like there are all these expectation for me to continue doing perfect, which is just super stressing. i also feel like i have to keep up a personality that isn't me in school, just to not get questioned ""why are you acting different from normal"" because i acted different in early grades. it also doesn't help that a few of my friend (to be clear, absolutely no shame or anger to them) have trusted me with thing like suicidal thoughts, which is just taking a toll on my mental state. i don't want to go to sleep at night because i don't want to go to school the next day. it just feel like everything is expected of me, but i can't fulfill most of it.

to elaborate, i feel like i need a personality for boy scouts, school, and i am myself at home",stress

632,"it's nothing that serious, most people feel this. everyday in 7th grade we get 5-6 home work that includes projects, essay and normal assignments. we only get 3-4 day to finish the project and 1 day for the 4-6 paragraph essay. when i come home, i do some of my home works. then i go eat, then i pray. do some more home works, then i eat, then i pray. this cycle repeat until it either 7 or 8 pm. some of the time, my family randomly just turn a random situation into a joke argument. i'm too stressed to fight so i end up shouting at them / saying offensive things. i don't mean them, but they say offensive thing and they meant it. make me more stressed. throughout my whole life, my body ha never been relaxed, only when i sleep, probably. i take 1-2 hour to sleep by just looking at a cracked, white wall. i always feel tense, i always feel like something bad is going to happen any moment. this would be the first time i vented sorry",stress

anyway. i got the job (yay!) but i've had this dizziness since. now, it's not a severe vertigo or anything - so meniere disease or bppv are out of the question - but it's a feeling of instability. like if i'm on a boat or a flight. sometimes i get second-long spell where the dizziness is worse.

anyone else? do you have any tips? is it the stress that's the cause or could it be something else? neck problems? computer vision syndrome? i'm also tired constantly, no matter how much i sleep, which i assume is connected.",stress

645,"hey, im a 3rd year student in architecture school. it wa my dream, i quit engineering school for it but right now i cant bear this stress. i cant bear the mean comment of teachers, long study hour (14-15 hour per a day) and high level stress. i cant quit it, because what im gonna tell people? i wa the gifted child and now i feel stupid because despite all the studying i cant get good grades. everyone say im not gonna be a good architect and that scare me. im going to therapy and using prozac but feel the same anyway. any suggestions?",stress

646,"i can do with some advise, help and insight. i took on another job in the company ive worked in for years. this should only be temporary a im covering someone who is too sick to do this job and it might be extended after 6 month if this person isnt well by then. im finding it difficult because i am unable to finish a task ive started because if another job turn up i have to see to this new job straight away. there no getting around that one. on hectic day this can happen multiple time throughout the day and i get behind on my paperwork. i try to get back on track and you guessed it something el turn up that i must see to straight away which put me even more behind. on some task im expected to do testing which is time consuming and whilst im doing this sometimes im thinking about other task i have to do then i start making mistake which put me further behind because i feel unable to take my time and concentrate because i feel i must not forget to do my other tasks.

also sometimes other job turn up at the same time and i cannot physically be in two place at once. i find this stressful because im expected to get the relevant information to do my paperwork and to do it perfectly on these two thing that turn up in different place at the same time.

sometimes i need help lifting heavy items. im female and i work on my own. sometimes the men will help. other time they wont because theyre too busy. i dont push them because i dont want to be an arsehole but my husband think i should be more forceful with them but i struggle with confrontation and i feel intimidated by it. then i think im not suitable for the job because im not scary enough to make others bend to my will.

even though im part of a team i work mostly on my own because thats the nature of my job so im unable to have someone help me when im snowed under by tasks. lot of people keep leaving and im now finding my manager are putting more task on me to do which isnt helping my stress levels. i feel angry at the people who run this company because they advertised for more worker to join the team. they then offer the job to people who are skilled in our workplace but they wont release them because theyre needed in the other department because they cant find anyone else to replace them. someone else in our department will be retiring soon and i fear more work will be put onto me.

too make matter worse there is only one other person who know the basic of my job so when i take holiday leave, ill be expected to catch up with the work they didnt do or done wrong when i get back a well a work coming in that day.

some day i feel sad and rubbish about myself because everyone else seems more cleverer and calmer than me. i very often experience brain fog at work and forget thing and feel overwhelmed. i wish i didnt have to do this job. i asked for my old job back and they wheedled around me by giving me tip on how to cope when really id rather have my other job back.

sometimes i wonder if i have anxiety and mild depression. i sometimes which i would die to escape having to do shit job for the rest of my life in order to survive. i wake up frequently in the night worrying about this job and i tell my brain to shut up and it wont  shut up. on the weekend i feel de-motivated and i dont feel like doing much and not much can distract my thought away from work.

should i stick it out until the summer or leave? i have looked at other job but i cant find anything yet that would suit my capabilities. i feel stuck. any good advice would be highly appreciated right now.",stress

647,"not sure if this is the place to ask but i don't understand why i can't handle a lot of thing at the same time or deal with a lot of stress without becoming depressed and passively suicidal. i have friend who juggle 3-4 different jobs, are in grad school, and still manage to enjoy their life by hanging out with friends, taking mini vacations, and just in general are still able to be happy.

i, on the other hand, can only handle being in grad school part time and having one part time job that's only 2 and 1/2 hour a week. anything more on my plate throw me into a depression where i hate my life and wish i can just escape from it all.

it wa even like this in college and when i wa younger in high school. i couldn't handle many extracurriculars or after school job cause it would wreck me.

so i guess i'm asking - why? if anyone know what could be the source? if anyone experience the same?

thanks :)",stress

677,"ive been really struggling.

ive struggled with anxiety and major episode of depression since i wa a kid. however, for the past year i have been at my worst.
25 f
my dad wa hit by a car on january 1st 2021. he wa hurt, back broken and some rib damaged and it wa a really hard time to get through since he wa just living in an rv on the street at the time. then of course, he got covid. luckily he didnt have a bad illness but we were both stressed especially since he wa broken and i couldnt be there for him. then we went over his scan from the icu that day and behold, he had a tumor. all within a month.
since then it basically been a cancer journey.
he had his surgery, the pathology came back that it spread to his lymph node which declares him with stage four prostate cancer. he is now doing adt hormone therapy which his body responds well too (his psa is now undetectable with one treatment) and then he will do radiation and he ha to take an additional oral treatment and steroid daily. (i didnt mention this but he fairly young 58)
he also recently finally got housing which ha been huge. he ha his own apartment but now his neighbor are complaining that he is loud and we are so stressed he would get kicked out of there (also i cant even lie my dad is so quiet and they say they can hear him walking around but his floor are carpeted and he only 145lbs)

anyways back to me i guess. ive struggled since the beginning. when im anxious i cant eat. lost a ton of weight and now mentally im struggling that im gaining it back and feeling gross about myself. i definitely have ibs problem from the stress. ive recently noticed im triggered from anything on tv regarding cancer or caring for people at then end of their life. ill have a panic attack. i just feel so lost. i wish i had more support, dont get me wrong my friend and bf are great but i feel like i am fighting the absolute battle anyone ha to deal with.",stress

like why do they need me? aren't they supposed to know their stuff? it stress me the fuck out and then im going to be the section leader too but im so afraid that i can't do it....if i mess up it brings the whole section down. i used to be good in choir but this whole stress it causing me to make mistake i didn't make before i stress so much that sometimes i can't even listen to music because it reminds me of choir and my mistakes....
i used to love choir really, but now i do it because i feel obligated to do it. i think to myself ""oh i can't quit because i've done it for so long and i just need to get over it"" i wish i could bring myself to talk to my close friend but it just make me feel like a terrible burden to them and my brain will never shut up about it. i wish i could talk to my choir teacher, but im not close with them even with all the year i've been with them and they still scare me.

680,"i cut off my sister on the first of the month.

the beginning:

my name is joey, and i'm a 27 year old non binary person. i grew up in a horrible situation, along with my mom and my younger sister.

my dad wa horribly, horribly abusive. he wasn't usually physically abusive to me and my sister (there are a few exception to this) but he would manipulate and gaslight us, and when i wa 15, there wa one awful night where i wa forced to participate in sexual acts.

luckily, my sister is amab, otherwise my dad may have forced the same sexual abuse on her.

my mom got the same emotional abuse but also, there wa a lot of physical abuse that wa directed towards her.

she cared deeply for me and my sister but our dad would gaslight u both to think terrible thing about our mother and she wa not allowed to spend time with u except to essentially be my dad's slave. for example, she wa forced to come on vacation with u but only to be the driver for the car we rented. she wa not permitted to participate in the fun activity or to spend time with me and my sister.

my dad would do the same with our friends, manipulating u into thinking they didn't care about u and turning u against them.

when i wa in middle school, i brought a few friend home, and my dad came up to my room about a half hour later, telling me that her mother had said something (either racist or sexual, i don't remember) and he forced the parent and my friend to leave.

the effects:

all three of u have dealt with awful trauma after we got away from my dad. someone told cps and they took my sister and i into foster care while my dad ran away from the police, i wa 15 at the time.

we haven't heard from him since, and my mom fought like hell to prove she wa a fit parent and get u back from foster care.

luckily, me and my sister had a foster family that cared deeply about u and wa super loving. we were only there for about 10 month and then my mom got u back.

after that, i spiraled downward to the point where i had to leave school and be on suicide watch. i would go to work with my mom every day. i wa scared to be left alone.

eventually my mom decided i needed some serious help because she wa so worried about me. she found an in patient program where teen went to work on their issues. (i wa 16)

i went to the program simply to appease my mom and for no other reason. i stayed there for the next 3 year and wa hospitalized once for a couple day for suicidal tendencies.

however, after a while of being there, i realized it wa actually working. the school program wa amazing, i wa really flourishing, and the work we were doing wa making a difference. i wa getting better.

while i wa there, i got given medication and wa even diagnosed with aspergers syndrome.

when i wa a kid, my dad came to me and said, ""your mom think you're r****ded.""

it turn out, my mom knew i had autism and my dad actively refused to get me tested!

three year later, i wa released home, where i wa able to go back to school and complete it.

i continued to go to therapy until my therapist retired, then we found a new therapist. i've kind of been bouncing around therapist ever since, but i'm getting better everyday.

my sister, however, wa not doing well.

she actively refused to get help. every single attempt my mom made wa met with resistance.

living with my sister wa hell on earth. she basically yelled at everyone constantly and about everything, slammed doors, and smoked weed all day.

i guess it's better than she smoked cigarettes, though.

i live in canada, where kid can be kicked out at age 16. the second my sister turned 16, she wa out. she moved in with my cousin for a year, and it wa an awesome year, all thing considered.

i wa so relieved.

doing anything during the time my sister wa living with u wa very difficult.

i almost never uploaded to my youtube channel because there wa almost never a quiet moment.

i wrote. a lot. it kept me sane due to living with my sister being such a hellish experience.

after my sister moved out i breathed a huge sigh of relief. i wa soooo happy.

after about a year my mom allowed my sister to move back in only if she signed a contract and complied with the rules.

it didn't last long, however. my mom ha never been very good at drawing line in the sand when it come to me and my sister, especially when it came to my sister abuse.

she just took it and my sister just continued emotionally abusing us. my mom wa having a hard time finding a balance.

at this time, i wasn't very confident and i couldn't say anything to my mom about it.

i wished so many time i had.

also, during this time, i wa having nightmare about a man who tortured and killed me. his name wa harvey, and my sister would deliberately say his name, and/or the name of the restaurant named harvey's just to upset me.

either way, we lived like this for several more years. when i turned 25, my mom announced that it wa time for u all to move out. i wa so relieved that i would finally be free of my sister!

my sister bounced around to friend house and sometimes hotel while my mom invited me to move into her guest room while i looked for an apartment.

it wa such a relaxing time! i had forgotten what it wa like to have an uninterrupted day. i wa emotionally exhausted from all those year living with my sister.

the stress wa palpable.

my entire demeanor changed after living with my mom for a few days. i wa clearly happier and le stressed.

a few week went by and thing were good, however, then my sister dropped a bomb. she asked me if i wanted to move in with her.

i said i had to think about it, and we hung out over the next few days. she wa a completely different person. i wa so happy that i had a sister again!

my mom kept warning me against moving in with her, but her word fell on deaf ears. i had made my decision.

however, i should have listened.

as soon a i signed the lease, my sister started acting terrible again, exactly the way she did when the three of u were living together. i think she manipulated me into getting a place with her.

it wa awful. she had a friend that came over almost every single day who seemed to keep her somewhat level.

she treated me like garbage, though. luckily for me, freedom wa just around the corner.

i moved in with my sister in around october 2019, and in march, a certain virus hit.

due to that, my mom let me move back in with her. i wa soaring high!

it wa such a relief to be living with my mom again. my sister wa my torment and my mother wa a safe haven.

i've been living with my mom for two year now, and we are currently looking for an apartment for me.

why i cut my sister off:

soon after i moved out, my sister's birthday arrived. i had just gotten a $600 cheque due to covid. i wanted to get my sister something special because of this. i bought her $100 in playstation gift cards. (she wa a huge gamer at the time).

she wa really happy, however, about a week or two later, she sent me and my mom a bunch of angry text about some stupid cheese grater. apparently, i had her cheese grater, and she thought i knew it and bought her all those card because i felt guilty. she also called me name and wa calling me a piece of s*it and stuff like that. i blocked her, deleted her texts, and decided not to get her anything for christmas if this wa how she wa going to be. (i did though).

i found out that she wa gay and wa dating her friend (they are both amab).

some time went by. i texted her every once in a while just to let her know i loved her.

eventually 2021 rolled around, and my mom told me my sister wa trans but that my sister wasn't allowed to know that i knew.

at the end of the summer, i wa going crazy. i told my mom she needed to tell my sister that i knew. my mom texted her and let her know.

time went by, and in september, i broke my arm. it sucked. a couple week after, though, she texted me and we started texting again and even talked on the phone.

i visited her and her girlfriend (who are both amab mtf trans) over the christmas holiday and spent two awesome day together!

on jan 31 or feb 1st i posted a story about how our relationship wa much better now! my sister found out and started sending angry texts. and yeah, i messed up. i made a mistake, i admit.

i tried to apologize but my sister just said ""not fucking cool.""

i wa getting ready to just leave it alone and ignore her until she had time to calm down and talk it out like adults. also, i didn't want to angry text. that wouldn't fix anything. it would just heat thing up more, and that's no good for anyone.

then i got another text from her.

i deleted the text so i can't remember the exact words, but it wa something about the fact that she ha cut off herself from the family because my mom wa manipulative and i wa a psychopath (i think) who had no empathy.

now, one of two thing were happening. either she really thought that way, in which case, why would she want to have a relationship with that kind of person? or she wa just saying mean things, which is a shitty thing to do just because i made a mistake. which, by the way, i apologized for. if she's angry, that's fine, but that's no excuse for calling name and swearing at me.

she also said something like ""this naive child act isnt fooling anyone"" and i'm sitting there thinking ""what naive child act? the act of realizing my mistake and apologizing for them?""

like, i recognized my mistake and apologized. not sure what else i can do. like, what doe she expect, me to get in a time machine and go back in time?

anyway, i should also mention at this point that when i saw my sister during the holidays, i apologized for what i'd done in the past. my sister didn't.

i didn't really care at the time. i just let me go because i thought our relationship wa headed in a good direction and i didn't want anything to mess it up.

however, my sister keep using excuse that she ha trauma and anxiety or whatever every single time she mess up. she won't admit what she's done in the past and/or apologize for it.

she seems to think that she doesn't make mistakes, and she can use her anxiety/trauma/ptsd a an excuse so she doesn't have to take responsibility for her actions.

after that text message i blocked her and deleted all the texts. i wondered how long i would have to leave her blocked for this time. but i slept on it and decided that this wa it. it wa over. she wa no good for me and she wa one of the toxic people that i needed to cut out of my life.

i'd cut several people out my life at this point, including both of my ex boyfriend and a friend.

i should add that my dad used to fly off the handle whenever we made one little mistake. even when it wa something that we fixed in some way (i can't think of how better to say it).

for example, i forgot to charge my phone the day before my dad wanted me to walk home by myself and he wa going to call me and give me directions. i forgot to charge my phone, so i called my dad cry on the phone from the school phone. i got voicemail and he didn't pick up.

i walked home all by myself and i wa so proud! unfortunately, my dad wasn't. he yelled at me. he made me write line and grounded me, even though i had called him to let him know what had happened and walked home all by myself.

i wasn't proud of myself anymore.

anyway my sister keep doing the exact same thing.

i'm done with her forever. if she ever want to apologize i will forgive her but i will never let her back in again.

i'm not posting this on a throwaway because:

1. i don't want it to be confidential and i want you all to know who it's coming from.

2. i want to know if my sister is keeping up with my reddit posts.

3. i want my sister to see this and know who it's coming from.

4. i'm hoping my sister will see this and get her s*it together. (although i seriously doubt it).",stress

i have a range of issue in my life.  i have a sibling with undiagnosed bpd who ha harassed me for year and interrogated me for every breath i took because she's not in control of her own emotion and feelings. she tried to sabotage every piece of my life. we haven't seen each other in year and she's still doing it. she won't stop til i have nothing left - my job, home, partner, family - she want to destroy everything because she's not happy. the cop won't help me because she's not threatening violence and i don't have the mean to take a civil injunction to court to stop her.

then my next biggest issue is my job. it can get incredibly intense.  there wa a period last summer where i wa required to move into work and work split shift and work 9 day straight.  when that stint came, the idea of split shift wa a lie to ge time to work.  my bos tried to sabotage any break that were planned in the middle of the day for me. basically i wa living in work and i wa required to get up when the nutjobs woke at cock-a-doodle time 3 - 5 am in the morning and then work all day til it wa time to go to bed at night time.

i also worked this stint during a heatwave.  i don't tolerate the heat and sun very well and i suffered.

694,"today i wa criticised for being too slow at work. it the first time in 15 year of my job that this ha happened. usually im early hitting my targets. and it hit me hard. i literally felt trapped and exploded with rage after the meeting.

why, i hear you ask, did this happen, and why did i explode?

in december, a the icing on a cake of shit, my wife had a car accident. she had a seizure  whilst she and out youngest (21 months) drove home from her work/his nursery. they were both ok, but the car wa written off and she wa instructed that she couldnt drive for 6-12 month pending a neurological investigation. (shes epileptic and this wa one of two seizure shes had in twenty years)

so, i wa tasked with taking and picking up our eldest to school, and our youngest to nursery. a round trip of about 1hr 45 min (together). on top of working a stressful job in computer graphic in a senior role.

with inflation hitting living expenses, rising cost of fuel etc, my anxiety over those is at a high worrying well never be able to move house a our current house is now too small for a family of 4.

this is, of course, on top of covid. in december 2019, we lost a close friend to cancer, then 2020 covid hit. my wife lost her mum, aunt, and uncle in the space of two week at the end of march/early april, then we lost a family friend. the following week, we had our second child the same week, i lost my permanent job of 12 years. we also lost another close friend and then my wife cousin passed away.

i scrambled to make end meet in a part time teaching role, but had to also look after our two boy a school and nursery were closed down.

it ha honestly been the worst 2 year ive ever experienced. and today, stressed with the constant task of getting my kid to school/nursery, i hit rock bottom.

i wont say i contemplated suicide because i couldnt do that, but i wa certainly left with the sense that there is basically no way out. im trapped.

i dont know what the fuck to do to be faster at my job when im already doing a 14 hour day between sorting out the kid with my wife, and working.

i have struggled a lot with my confidence for the first past few years, im only 17 and sometimes it just get to me i started and new job in the summer  holiday last year and at first it wa nice to have something to do instead of sitting in my bed feeling bad for myself, i made some friend at work and it wa going good till about 1 month ago where i fell back into that depression again and i dont feel like i want to leave my bed i also have college in the week the only day i do get off im spent doing college work or nothing enjoyable, my new college ha been tiring cause i have friend but not close i never really have had a friend i can talk to about my problem like im in a group of three people and these two girl are closer even though we have all know each other for the same amount of time i guess it just make me feel sad when there close hugging etc and i feel left out like i always have, it like they do include me in thing but it just doesnt feel right i will sometimes just be with one of them on their own and we just sit in this like awkward silence and barely even talk unless it about class work or class that we have, it wa the same in secondary school (high school) i had a group of friend and there wa seven of u and i never really felt close with them either not enough to share stuff with them then eventually when our group got smaller and some of u didnt speak but i did with one of the girl and we were close for a while until college (before i moved college to the one i am in now), when we got split up into different class even though we signed up for the same course she became close with this girl and when we would sit together at lunch she would bring her too and i just never feel good about myself cause people in think are close to me leave me all the time or get new best mate and we were close like we did everything together we even walked to college the day it started together, then we fell out and thing havent been the same since especially me moving college which i needed to do for my health now im seeing her posting picture with this girl all the time and it the same with the two girl in my new college they will take picture together in class while im sitting on there table and will leave me to myself.

also going back to my job a month ago i wa close with this girl cause id get the bus too my new college with her, and of course there happened to be a new employee that we have shift with on the weekend and they get close since there both eighteen they got out clubbing together and drink together i feel like when im eighteen she will probably not invite me out for drinks, basically the whole vibe at work ha changed cause the people that are similar age range a me from about 17/20 year old i worked with before the new girl came along we got along we would talk after serving customer but now they just talk to her, also my break time ha changed and they gave her my break time ,although it not a big deal i just feel so put out like im never going to have a good close friend.
also dont even get me started on the stress the college is putting on me to pas english otherwise next year i cant do the course that i enjoy.

im also feeling jealous cause of my younger sister who is starting college this year, she is so smart and im just dumb like all the mark she is getting in her test i didnt get half of when i wa in school i barely passed any class and got 2 and she is here getting 7s, also new insecurity unlocked she ha a boyfriend and i have never had one that ioved me a much a hers does.

725,"yes, there is an obvious answer here. but doe stress have more of an impact on people with depression or on people with anxiety? are the precise symptom of stress any different, for example the type of headache (areas, how it feels, etc.) compared to casual stress that show no difference of symptom between the two illnesses?

727,"to quickly summarise i have no motivation whatsoever which is terrible because i have my a level in a few month but i cant focus or bring myself to study. i have a test tomorrow which i havent started revising for and i can feel the anxiety building up in me yet im still here on my phone -my biggest distraction. i honestly hate being on my phone,hate social medium but i seem to be on it 24/7. i do want to do well and go to university. i am smart and i know i have the potential to do very well which is the worst part a i know im wasting it. i always leave thing to the last minute and procrastination is what i do best. i also hate doing badly in test and getting thing wrong so not sure why i cant bring myself study. a big part of revising chemistry specifically is the stress and anxiety i get when i come across a question i cant do so i end up taking a break and not returning to the work because i get such a bad headache from the stress/anxiety.",stress

728,"this is the first time in my life ive struggled with financial stress due to several factor but it spilling out onto other area of my life. i will be in the middle of a conversation laughing and joking and suddenly i get an overwhelming sense of dread about my financial situation.

729,so there's this thing i'm preparing for (i'll not say what it is to save myself the embarrassment.  it's that trivial). and there's something i can't decide on. i just picked what sounded good to me at that 1 moment. and now i'm stressing out because i have the option to change it but not for long. to give you context. i'm conciously aware that this will probably not matter 1 day after i use it let alone one year. but it's not like i control what i stress over. any idea what to do? for some reason it give me chills. i couldn't sleep earlier today (thing is this is a reoccurring problem with me. i tend to get anxios out over random thing and it keep me from focusing on anything because it's dancing at the back of my head),stress

730,"ive known it for year that im not going to right direction. but when it finally happens it overwhelmingly awful. burning out.

for me year of work stress finally manifested a burnout through multiple physical symptoms.

in one month i went from stressed but working into being on sick leave and suffering from tinnitus, heartburn, heart palpitation and insomnia. leading back to increased anxiety and depression.

i went from not having medication into anti depressants, stomach meds, sleeping pills..

im also doing therapy which i tried to to do with meditation to avoid medication but seems like i need all help now.

i hope this encourages people to listen your stress and seek help before it get worse.

731,"hi guys. need some advice.

for over give year now i've been able to sort of click/crack my jaw out of place. don't remember how it started, i would have been quite young. all i know is it sort of... an addiction? i need to do it every few second to feel normal. if i don't do it, i can't focus on anything else.

thing is, i never took into consideration that it may be really damaging to my jaw. i've tried to stop but it's all i can think about.

however, i've also noticed that i don't do it a often if i'm at home, doing something like playing a game or talking to friends/family. however, if i'm at school i can't stop it, and it's constant. it give me a headache when i do it all day.

i can now click the jaw on both side a of about 3 month ago. i feel like this really is not ok and i don't know if it's a stress thing. i have no idea where to go or what to do about this issue. i'm sorry for even asking about something so stupid, i just worry because i'm so young and my jaw is this bad already.

733,"hi everyone,

so, im going to try to explain this a briefly a possible a to not bore the crap out of you all.

my husband and i have been together for 10 year (married for just over 7). i moved to germany to be with him after we met in the u (where im originally from). i have never been completely happy here in germany, i miss my friend and family and i dont have the career i wanted to have (mostly due to opportunity here compared to in the states). before we married the plan wa to eventually move to the states. i dont sense any real desire from him to do so. i feel like ive wasted time on this marriage and am realizing that we just want different thing out of life. the biggest problem im having at the moment is that we have pet and i want to take them back to the state with me but it is going to be difficult to find a rental with several pets.

i feel guilty up and leaving my marriage to pursue what i need for me. ive given up a lot for this relationship and he hasnt had to compromised away his goal and family to be with me the way that i have.

my question is - should i feel guilty for wanting more out of my life if that entail leaving my marriage? i sometimes feel like im either choosing guilt or resentment.",stress

734,"so i am in a really weird state of mind right now and don't really know what to make of it. i feel so happy yet miserable, so enthusiastic yet so drained, so optimistic yet so negative, etcetera etcetera.

i have an amazing wife, a baby on the way, a good job, potentially an even better career in the near future, my financial standing is okay i guess but i'm not struggling....and yet i am down in the dump a lot, consistently thinking of the worst case scenario, smoking more and more cigarette each day, focussing a lot more attention than usual to my computer, over sleeping, destroying my diet and i have lost all motivation to do the thing i enjoy like making music, listening to music maintaining friendship and i haven't even been to the gym since october.

i am struggling to put my finger on how i am feeling because i still laugh the same, i crack a smile at everything like normal, i even enjoy my wife's company all the same but it just feels...off? a if everything is just a lucid dream that never end or something.

737,"i sometimes experience stress from work. i am a nanny for a family. sometimes the hour can be long, the load can be intense, often there are issue with one of the younger child who ha special needs/non verbal autism.  the child like to attack often and lash out.  sometimes the parent like to get away and i am at their home picking everything up.

&amp;#x200b;

&amp;#x200b;

i usually when stressed i deal with it in my own free time through hobby that relax me.

&amp;#x200b;

last summer i had a week from hell at work.  i wa living in for a week because the parent were gone. the plan wa split shift for the week when others coming in to help for the week.  it never worked out like that.  the child wasn't able to sleep properly and i wa up at 3-4 am every morning with her.  when she went to school, i wa supposed to have a break but then the parent scheduled house improvement for the same week which they forgot about and a team of worker came in top of me who wanted me to clear out rooms.  so the break that i wa scheduled to have were pretty much denied. this week coincided with an intense heatwave.  so my work day were a 3-4 am start until about 11 or 12 at night finish time with only short break throughout.

&amp;#x200b;

by the time i got off work, i became ill.   my gp referred me to the hospital for test but i am on a waiting list to be seen.  my gp gave me a vague diagnosis but we don't know it yet until i am tested.

&amp;#x200b;

stress is a common trigger for the condition.  over the past 3 month or so, i wa managing well.   february is scheduled to be another crazy month for work. the parent are going away for spring break and want me at home in their home.  for 10 days.  i know it's only a matter of time before they dump the load on me no matter what.  i'm dreading the week coming up because the parent are so sneaky.  i am apprehensive too about it all now too because of the covid situation. we are all vaccinated but i am still worried.  what if the parent contract the virus when they are away and what if they become ill and what if they need to isolate and what if they can't come home a planned?

&amp;#x200b;

what if i get sick while they are away?

what if the special need child get sick?

what if the child pick up covid in school and brings it home to me? what if i get ill.   i know it's said to be mild but mild just mean you don't need hospital. it might still mean a sickness at home for one or two weeks. am i expected just to keep on working during sickness.

&amp;#x200b;

i am also being investigated for another condition from last summer.  what if the stress is high and sleep is low? what if stress cause another flare and i get sick again? what if covid and a flare happens together?   this also leaving out physical assault from the child too. she's non verbal but she's going to know her parent are gone and shes going to last out on me.

ive spoken to a doctor about this and they said thats not high. but ive always been at around 90-95bpm when standing up and walking around the house.

but a couple month ago i hit what id call the biggest wall ive ever faced. i used to be so resilient, so strong. i had perspective and i could handle small things. but lately, ive felt so fragile. like you could knock me over with a feather. i had a little over a week off for the holiday and i took an additional week afterwards, which im in the middle of now. i go back to work on monday and im absolutely terrified of cry at work. but ive cried every day over something. yesterday it wa an episode of queer eye - not a big shock, that show make people cry, but i like full on wept. this morning my son accidentally broke a new novelty glass wed bought for christmas - it wa like $7 but i had to go sit in my office and sob over it so the kid wouldnt see me cry over something so silly.

maybe the worst is that all of my friend are going through way worse right now - medical problems, relationship issues, having to stay with family after getting kicked out of their homes. i feel so stupid for having this problem, i cant talk to them about it because what theyre all dealing with is a million time worse. so, im taking to an anonymous discussion board in the hope that someone out there can help. i want my resilience back. i dont want to cry every day. i dont want to feel like id shatter into a million piece if anything went wrong.",stress

somedays i understand that choice in a big way. why put word out there that really don't need to be spoken, they aren't important/ they don't matter. if spoken they can be twisted and manipulated even when they were originally spoken without any ill intent. just stop talking.  just stop engaging. if you stop they won't hurt you and you won't hurt others.

i remember i used to get a sore throat from talking 'too much' . then it became normal to engage with the world and converse with others.

the reason i'm confused is because i have had really tough and unbearable moment of stress in my life - but not recently. in fact i'd say i'm the most comfortable and happy that i've been in a very very long time. whats been stressing me out the most is all of these symptom and trying to figure out what's wrong with me. when i wa actually going through stressful times,  i barely felt any physical side effects.  or maybe i just didn't notice them.  but i'm doing so much better now in my life and i get really frustrated and quite frankly pissed off that my body is causing me more anxiety and stress than anything else in my life is.

under the overwhelming responsibility and being in the rush in the fast-growing modern world, stress is sometimes unavoidable. hence, the case of inflammation increase in clinical papers. when the stress becomes chronic and uncontrollable it can be a detriment for the body. these long-term stress are linked to chronic inflammations.

when the body is under the condition of stress the organism go through fight-and-flight responses. this is the body reaction to some harmful attack for it survival. during this process cortisol- a stress hormone is released. cortisol suppresses digestion and accurate immune response to stress. it sends signal to the brain that affects[**mood, motivation, and fear**](https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/stress-management/in-depth/stress/art-20046037#:~:text=adrenaline%20increases%20your%20heart%20rate,of%20substances%20that%20repair%20tissues.).

cortisol cause excess production of glucose (blood sugar), prevents the production of insulin, and narrow the arteries. this is the reason why the blood start pumping harder under the stress. adrenalin is another hormone that cause increased heart and respiratory rate also cause blood pressure.

when the body is under constant stress flight-or-fight response are always present. consequently, when the stress response are always on and the hormone constantly restrict the body natural process many disease such a anxiety, depression, metabolic disorders, and obesity can come forth. stress can also be aggravator for multiple sclerosis. there are[**studies**](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/pmc3115807/), linking the stressful lifestyle and the exacerbation of the diseases.

another major cause of inflammation can be oxidative stress. this is the excess production of reactive oxygen specie (ros) also known a free radical in the body cell and tissues. and the insufficiency of antioxidant (fighters against free radicals) can be extremely harmful to cellular molecules, cause dna damage, proteins.

the balanced amount of ro is considered to be even profitable for the body being involved in the cell homeostasis and function such a gene expression and activation of[**receptors.**](https://europepmc.org/backend/ptpmcrender.fcgi?accid=pmc5055983&amp;blobtype=pdf)

several factor and lifestyle can bring to oxidative stress. unrestrained and extreme amount of exercise, smoking and drug misuse, fatty, processed, and refined food, and even untreated injury or trauma are major cause of oxidative stress.

the production of an excessive amount of ro in the body can lead to the activation of proinflammatory cytokine (regulators of inflammatory reactions). there is a line of evidence from[**studies**](https://www.hindawi.com/journals/omcl/2013/963520/), that oxidative stress play a pathogenic role in chronic inflammatory diseases.

generated ro in brain tissue can lead to neuroinflammation and cell death later causing neurodegenerative disease and memory loss.


chronic inflammation is a serious case and ha a significant link to aging and longevity. healthy life management and a conscious lifestyle can increasingly decrease the possibility of any type of inflammation and enhance longevity.",stress

anyhow, i am keen to think maybe my body now might react to stress due to hive a i wa meant to take the gre today (the reason i didn't is one of the most bizarre things, but that's for another day) and i'm curious if my body decided to think this heightened level of stress wa something that could've harmed me so tried to flare up with hives.

anyhow, lemme know what you think. i took some ashwagandha to try to see if it might help the stress/anxiety and it seemed like it, but i always have been a high-stress person (even a a kid) to the point where stress shuts me down mentally. so whenever i take the stuff, i get weirdly emotional because my body can't generate the proper stress response.

my skin on my body is also hypersensitive. when the cool air or wind brush against my skin i cringe.

does anyone else have issue like this?

btw: ive tried paraben free shampoo a well. to see if thats the issue. ive never had this problem before with hairspray stinging. it and it odd that it only in that area where feel the burning brain surge of adrenaline.
maybe those nerve ending are super irritated in that area?

ive been to two dermatologist when i had this at the start of my tapering and they just gave me t-gel shampoo and some cortisteroid lotion to use of which both which burned like crazy! so i stopped using it.

ive read that stress and anxiety can cause all kind of skin issues, but ive never had stinging from hairspray before. ive tried different one and they all sting. but it only in that area where i feel those adrenaline surges.

792,"link to the original video : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7r-m1gzkdb8

here are five tip to help you reduce your holiday anxiety. number 1. dont invite people known to cause trouble at your holiday gathering.

if you have someone on your holiday guest list who is known to cause trouble. for example, start fights, show up high, or insists on talking about politics or other difficult topics. dont invite them to your gathering. attending holiday gathering is a privilege. do whats right for you by not inviting discord into your event. the same is true for event you are invited. you do not need to go to a party or event that make you uncomfortable.

number 2. create a budget and stick to it!

money, or the lack of it, is a major source of stress during the holiday season. whether it purchasing gift or spending on decoration and parties, the holiday can get expensive. set a budget and stick to it. avoid impulse shopping. there no need to tempt yourself by browsing item you dont have the fund to buy. no matter how you choose to budget for the holidays, setting a budget and sticking to it will reduce your holiday stress levels.

number 3. simplify!

another source of stress during the holiday is doing too much. if you need a vacation from your vacation, it isnt much of a rest period. do you really have to do everything on your list? do you decorate every room in the house because you want to? or because others believe you should. if it brings you joy to decorate every room in the house, by all mean do it. but if you are doing task out of expectation, consider downsizing.

number 4. remember the reason for the season!

your stress may decrease if you keep focused on why we do what we do at this time of year. perhaps you are a religious person who connects with your holiday a a time of awe or renewal. you may be more secular and experience this a a time to be with family and friends. for some, this may be a time of year that reminds you of difficult experiences, so you may need to reach out and find new positive meaning for the season. whatever your beliefs, focus on whats important to you, rather than task and being busy. doing activity that have meaning will help reduce your anxiety

and number 5. practice gratitude.

perhaps most important, the holiday season provides an opportunity to spend time thinking about all that we have to be grateful for. family, friends, meaningful work, and more. when we are able to see what we have, rather than fixate on what we dont, some of our anxiety will give way to love, grace, and hope.",stress

811,"im a high schooler right now, and am applying to college. im taking multivariable calculus (a college level math course) right now, and the only way for me to end with an a in the class is if i get a 97-100 on the next two tests.

i cant keep my mind from worrying about this. every time i think about the class, i just want to throw up. i liked math before this, but im also taking an extremely rigorous course load, have so many extra thing i do outside of school, and giving my 120% to each activity is just draining me. sleeping is the best thing and only thing i want to do bc im so mentally drained.

i just dont know how to keep going. i have 1.5 week left in this calculus class. how do i continue the grind when im this exhausted and study efficiently? i have final coming up, so i really need advice.

to top this off, my parent yelling and screaming make me want to cry. not make me, it ha made me. ive been cry so much lately because of them, because of this stress, and i had a breakdown the other day.

i know i can grind and make sure that i do good on the tests. but how? how do i keep going on like this, when everything is pulling me down? these past week have definitely been one of the hardest in my (short) life.

831,"hi!

-my name is mustapha.i'm 17 year old and i'm from tunisia.today i'm gonna talk about something that is shady and it's bothering me for awhile and it's about my family.so there are some thing that i wont rly explain cuz i will leave them for some next messages.

-so here is the subject.i have depression since 2017 (that doesn't mean i didnt enjoy thing over the years)and it is caused by some bullying from school and many problem by my own father.and due to all of this pressure,my education ha fallen so terribly over the years.and now we are 2021 and i left school.not because of bullying.cuz school did make my mental health worse.i didn't have patient to sit in class and wait for like 8 hour to do something that i love.i wa like ""what's the point of learning something that i know i won't use in the future.while i can just leave.take care of my mental health in anytime and doing my hobby"".but did that plan go well.no,and the reason is that my family did not support me at all for leaving school.they didn't even support me when i i wa in school and not studying.basicaly,they did abuse me mentally,sometimes physically and here are some best example of what i mean by ""mentally abuse"":

-""you will be like the people of our town.who take drug and jobless""

-""if you don't know what you will do for your future.you are gonna be nothing""

-""without any college degree or any type of studying or not doing some money business.you are failure""

-""depression isn't an excuse for doing nothing""

-""at least go open our arcade area to be useful at something in your life""

-""you will be a bad person like your father""

-""your hobby is nothing without studying""


-now here is where i call my family idiots.if they already know how my depression went before and how my father is the one that started everything.and i had bullying in the middle school.i also had anxiety, stress for no reason at all.why in the hell they think by comparing me to the person that i hate the most will fix thing like my education or my mental health and why the hell would they try to compare me to people that are doing drug or people that are studying.and even after i told them that this will not fix anything.it will make thing worse.but they didn't listen.and some thing got worse now i always can't do my hobby or play video game or listening to music comfortable anymore.their voices,their words,my past,my all bad moment are stuck in my head.playing all over again.i can't even control myself to focus on the task.i told my therapist about how they are telling me all of this stuff.but guess what it didn't work cuz she literally called my mother and told her that ""i am lazy cuz i don't want to do anything"".i have antidepressant to ""help"" me with depression.but tbh they weren't rly useful.here is my biggest problem when my therapist told my mother that i'm lazy.now would you call laziness if a teenage boy suffering from depression for 5 straight year and had multiple suicidal thoughts,injured himself out of anger,dealt with fake friends,trauma,toxic people,toxic environment and felt confused,lost cuz sometimes he doesn't know what he wants,what is missing in his life,doesn't wake up early cuz he ha insomnia for so long that he forgot when he woke up at least 11 am last time,left school cuz when he is always there he feel he is gonna lose his mind cuz he can't stand what he is learning.. .i will let you decide who is the right and who is the wrong.

-you see what i mean by all of this.i sometimes feel like they are trying to make me a villian or acused for making my self depressed and whenever i can't find an excuse for my own depression.im guilty.i did try thing like training but they didn't rly make me feel better or something.and everyday when my family want me to open the ""arcade area"" for them to gain money cuz my brother are studying (although they always caring for business)they seem suspicious.i feel i am being used or something.here is an example there wa one time where i didn't eat launch and had nobody to come for me so i can go and eat.it wa like 8pm.i decided to leave one of the client which he is old and we know for a very long time and when i got home.my brother got angry and telling me thing like ""you idiot.why did you do that"".another example and most obvious one is that my mother want me to sleep early cuz ""for my mental health"".but for the most part it's about their business.and when i do open the arcade area late or i don't want to open it.she start to get angry at me and tell me some thing and always take my phone away.and when i do open it early.she act normal.

-so what do i think of my family?well tbh they do care for my future but they did it in a very wrong way  cuz i don't want to rush thing so quickly.i am starting my hobby small and then it get bigger.but my family want results.they don't care about progress.they don't even know what my hobby mean for me.although i kinda have some fun with them.but their word and everything are stuck in my mind.and over the year i rly lost my trust and respect for them.i don't feel i care about them that much like when i used to a a kid.they rly did tell me some shady thing by my own hobby.and i do feel betrayed and mad about that.i know this wa rly long message.but what should i do in this situation? how can i ignore their insults? how can i be le nervous and anxious? how to make my self be happy if thing like training and meditation don't work? and how can i have a passion for my hobby 100 percent again without stress?

thanks for your advice.peace",stress

844,"hi all,

apologies in advance if this is not okay to post here but i am recruiting for my mres study on chronic stress and attention.

**the study**

comprises an attention measuring task and two short questionnaire about stress and anxiety. it should take approximately 10 minute to complete. all participant will receive their own unique link to the study, so please comment or message me if you are interested and i will send you the info sheet and study link (i'll need an email address). study is being carried out a part of my mres at the university of liverpool. all participant data will be anonymised and held securely (your participant information sheet should cover everything you need to know before you commit to taking part, but i am of course more than happy to answer questions)

there are no exclusion criterion apart from that you must be aged over 18.

because of how the attention task works, this study can't be completed using a touch screen; you will need to be using a device with a physical keyboard.

**a bit of background:**

chronic stress is known to affect physical and mental health, but it can also have a dramatic impact on attention and cognitive performance in way that remain poorly understood. this can have negative consequence in everyday life and in the workplace, where stress-induced failure of attention can reduce performance, productivity, and safety  sometimes with fatal consequences. however, we know incredibly little about individual difference in attention function across the general population. this study aim to increase our understanding of how stress affect human attention and cognitive performance.

i would spend every ounce of enegy at this job. i used to wake up at the last minute for work. my heart would be pounding. i would sleep 3-4 hour a night, the more short staffed we became... hungover every day because i drank to cope with the inhumane amount of stress, red eyes, leg feeling like jello, my left leg went numb, i would violently shake and sob while feeling so weak from barely eating... i just had to survive another day there. just one more day, i would tell myself. just one more day, one more day, one more day. i knew how much my friend would suffer if i wasn't there for even just one day, i tried to put in my two week in with the owner... i wa so sure in my mind that i wa done because of how much i wa physically and mentally suffering. we were alone in his office for over an hour.. i told him i wa suicidal, beyond anxious, physically ill from the stress that is put on me... and he covered it up with praise and compliment to me. asked me to give him just one more chance. the new girl would be the savior of the day (even though everyone quits almost immediately after starting.) they are immediately overworked from the moment they start. if they don't quit immediately, then it's after a month. if it's not after a month, it's because they feel so stuck there and manipulated that they can't ever leave because they see no other option for themselves, and because they see other people suffering so deeply. and because of the manipulation and guilting that come from the operation manager and owner. they didn't show me any emotion or care.

 i took maybe 3-4 sick day in almost two year and no vacation while i worked there. the operation manager took over a week vacation just the other week... a staycation where she knew we were all suffering immensely with almost no staff. twice while i worked there. she guilted people into not taking vacations, she made me call and text the poor worker to come in on their day off every fucking week when they were already so maxed out. she wanted me to look like the bad guy. she would talk about them like they are putrid animal who are lazy and don't deserve a break while they are killing themselves for this fucking business. when i told that bitch that i had put in my two week with the owner, and that no amount of bribing, guilting, begging, pleading, sucking up to, anger, and compliment from him would stop me... i wa sobbing and shaking in fear of her. i told her how much i care about them, but how no amount of money he offer me, and how nothing will stop me. i wa so sick that i wa only functioning on the last bit of strength my body offered me every day. and she looked at me with disgust and a piercing venomous stare that made my blood boil.

 but, i had already been so sick to my stomach shaking and crying, chest pain from my heart racing for so long, and weakness in my body entirely, that i could not stand up to her in that moment. all she said was, ""well can't you just stay for at least another month? now all of your work is going to fall on my shoulders. i'm going to have to hire people like crazy."" and then she looked at me with anger, rolling her eyes. i wa sobbing and shaking the whole time, and i told her how sorry i wa for that, but no way. i need to stand up for myself. and i told her that maybe i'm not mentally strong enough for this job, and that i'm replaceable. didn't know what other approach to take. and she shrugged her shoulder and rolled her eye with annoyance. and i told her that if the owner were to cut his client in half, it would make me reconsider. she angrily told me, ""well thats how we make our money.""
i said,  ""ok, well i would need thing to drastically change if i wa to ever reconsider staying at this place.""
theres no way. everyone quits so fast. that woman hire people off of the streets. anyone who's willing to make u to  survive just one more day.
and then these poor new worker come in with a bright excited smile, and they see me, looking beyond overwhelmed. a the office manager. along with the few people holding that business together.

it wa a running joke... ""just give it to vivian."" the operation manager would say. just give it to vivian. just give it to vivian, just give it to vivian. while she pile all of the work on me while she got to leave early every day and go on the road every single week near the end. she'd say,"" oh it's not like i enjoy going on a the road, going on death calls."" a she would attempt to conceal that sly smirk of hers. it is so much easier than being stuck in that building like i always was. this place work for every funeral home in the state, soooo many out of state funeral homes, other countries, the donation company in this state and many out of state too which i had to do all of the death certificate for. i had at least 30 at a time on edrs. because i tried to complete all of them on time. i get in trouble with the state if it's not done fast enough.
and then the muslim burial funeral home that i had to do all of the death certificate for. i got new death call from the owner of that place, who treated his family like garbage, who treated my driver with complete disrespect. i once broke the rule and called him to yell at him about how angry i wa about how he treat my driver when he should be yelling at me. the office manager who dispatch my few driver on million of calls. he would steal at least one of the few driver i had for his all day runs.
i had to complete all of his death certificate within 24 hour of the decedent's death. meaning, i had to call the doctor and harass them over and over again to sign those stupid death certificates. a lot of the doctor not knowing how to even log onto edrs. so i had to teach them. a lot of these death certificate were death in king county. i had to get a da number. a disposition authorization number. often having to call the medical examiner to get it for me, while i had to send my proof copy of the death certificate vitals after typing them up while i have ten people on hold, a desk full of file and papers... a million other death certificate with many other angry funeral home calling me to yell at me for not making them a number one priority.

 and call every second of the day with many specific requests, to do thing for every one of the many many many manyyyyy clients. some of them were so kind and understanding to me. my friends. but they had to do their job too. it wasn't their fault thay i wa beyond overwhelmed, sobbing almost every day in the office, trying to contain myself in front of the many client and family that would call, and my drivers. some of the client and family would be so upset because they thought i wa slacking on my job... when in reality, there wasn't near enough time in the day. oh.. there's so much more. i had to dispatch the very few driver i had to work with, on million of calls... planning their entire route while dealing with much more than what i have explained so far. it wa a changing puzzle every minute of the day with all of the call to deal with on my own. the new death call that would come in so often, it would make me so angry that i had to put them and every other person on hold to throw my pen and paper around the room while i wa alone in the building, also while many client would come into the building with ton and ton of new dead body for me to deal with on my own. while having to deal with everything in the office.. and the other million of death certificate and emails. emails, emails, emails, emails. every 5 second a new one. i got so used to doing at least 20 thing at once and i got so good at it without making mistakes. i wa almost flawless. and there wa one funeral home who would bring in 4-10 body at a time, piling all of the body on top of each other... which is illegal by the way. it wa the fault of the funeral director that made the poor driver do it. also the same people who constantly belittled and yelled at me on the phone, and in the emails. the cap lock they would use for emphasis, directed at me. ""i cannot do my job if you don't do yours!!!!!!!!!""

because the owner and operation manager were too lazy to deal with it,  they made me do it. something about this job make you want to kill yourself and sell your soul to save the company. what the actual fuck is this. and your well being. your happiness. there were always many funeral home bringing in many body one after the other after the other, after the other, while the phone would ring off the hook and i'd have to run back and forth. with the few second i had, i would spend time pulling out so many body out of the coolers, just to make room for one more and stuff it in there or put it on the floor. stuff it in there like a sausage. because i didn't have a damn choice. with how many body i've seen, how many overdoses, suicides, illness, covid, hangings, shotgun wounds, getting run over by a giant truck, mother son car accidents, murder suicides, drownings, decomposed bodies, nicely embalmed body with sweet family taking care and putting a beautiful hat or earrings, or whatever wa meaningful to them, the one that were dead in their house or the lake for weeks... months... eventually i felt no empathy for all of them. it took a lot for me to feel empathy for them after so long of running on almost no energy left. i lost it all. because of how sick i was, i couldn't bring myself to feel normal human emotion anymore.
because i couldn't survive there while also feeling empathy for the deceased. i just had to find a way to find space for all of them on my own in three giant cooler with 700+ bodies, being short staffed, crying, suffering, almost vomiting daily from the stress. until i had one or two people arrive for their shift to help me. then i could go to the bathroom and cry in peace. or go cry with the other few people we had after they had had enough in that building a well.
the operation manager wa absolutely no help until i asked her question on how to do something because she refused to get up off of her as to help everyone that wa suffering.

 it hurt so badly that my coworkers are still there, now suffering much worse because i'm not there to protect them anymore.

oh, also, i used to take death certificate home with me because i got in trouble for not getting all of them done on time. i had an impossible amount to do on my own.. she used to pretend to care about me and not wanting me to do them at home... but eventually, when i asked her again, she said, ""it's ok vivian, i didn't hear that."" and just looked at me with approval. the abuse wasn't apparent until i started getting so sick physically and mentally ill that it took sheer willpower to make it through one day before i would collapse and then sit in the corner of my bed in the dark, in my room. just shaking and cry uncontrollably.

my biggest wish, is for thay business to collapse and fall to the ground. i hope they all get out and survive. like i finally am now.",stress

nondirective meditation activates default mode network and area associated with memory retrieval and emotional processing (february 2014)

nondirective meditation technique are practiced with a relaxed focus of attention that permit spontaneously occurring thoughts, images, sensations, memories, and emotion to emerge and pas freely, without any expectation that mind wandering should abate. these technique are thought to facilitate mental processing of emotional experiences, thereby contributing to wellness and stress management. the present study assessed brain activity by functional magnetic resonance imaging (fmri) in 14 experienced practitioner of acem meditation in two experimental conditions. in the first, nondirective meditation wa compared to rest. significantly increased activity wa detected in area associated with attention, mind wandering, retrieval of episodic memories, and emotional processing. in the second condition, participant carried out concentrative practicing of the same meditation technique, actively trying to avoid mind wandering. the contrast nondirective meditation &gt; concentrative practicing wa characterized by higher activity in the right medial temporal lobe (parahippocampal gyrus and amygdala). in conclusion, the present result support the notion that nondirective meditation, which permit mind wandering, involves more extensive activation of brain area associated with episodic memory and emotional processing, than during concentrative practicing or regular rest.

i've tried meditating, exercising, socialising, youtube videos.. etc over the year, and this wa the only thing that ha worked for me so far. this is because even with all these activity i couldn't overcome the thought running through my head (and believe me i've tried very hard).

its miraculous i didnt hit my head. in fact it kind of puzzle me, but i wa blacked out drunk (working on recovery now).

it dawned on me that maybe my existence for the past 2 month ha been in a coma. that im in a hospital bed on life support; surrounded by family; experience with family are my mind manifesting their conversation they have around me. 

everything is just a manifestation of my mind but im actually in a coma.

im weirded out and there are several trigger that cause me to second guess myself.

edit: some of the trigger i mean include that grocery is symbolism for nutrients/iv time, my parent visiting in life are just visiting me in a hospital, friend who i no longer speak with recently have actually said their good byes; an ex lover i always thought about getting back together with finally blocked me out after 4 year - i got disconnected.

right now my friend and family are gone, family is on a trip at the moment. that may be symbolism that they too, have left. for now or ever im unsure.

22,"it take more to overwhelm some people than others, but the feeling and the impact are the same: overload and not knowing which way to turn next which trigger a downward spiral of anxiety.

### take these step to create a plan and go from feeling overwhelmed to feeling peaceful again:

**identify what you can and cant control.** list your issue in three columns: what you can control, what you can influence and what is out-with your control. 

**focus on solutions.** now that you have perspective on what you can and cant control, identify your chosen end point for each issue. shift your focus from the problem to the solutions.

**prioritise your actions.** consider your chosen solution in term of how important they are and how urgent they are. firstly, deal with the issue that are both important and urgent then move to the other important issues. a a general rule, deal with the important issue over the urgent issues: here-in lie the path to living sustainably crisis free.

**communicate.** with your plan in place, communicate with those who may be affected: it incredible how supportive people can be once they understand your situation.

**eat well.** overwhelm commonly lead to skipping meal or over-reliance on junk food. buy in some healthy food and snack to give you the nutrition youll need to play your best game.

**gratitude.** it is easy to lose sight of the good thing happening when we feel overwhelmed. adopt the habit of regularly reflecting on the thing youre grateful for: that youre taking control of challenging situations, that youre on your way to calmer times, that youre learning a lot about yourself, perhaps that others are supporting you.

**blow off some steam.** exercise  whatever work best for you: a brisk walk, hit the weights, an hour on the bike  ha a magical ability to burn off that anxiety and re-set all those neurotransmitters. it will also help you get that good night sleep.

**get your rest.** know that youre focusing on your priority with a clear plan. youre pushing yourself hard through the day. a good night sleep is the smartest thing you can give yourself to keep working through your list. 

**celebrate your successes.** each step forward is worthy of celebration. be proud of yourself for taking control and moving forward. each success lead to further step forward.  
 

**overwhelm is a situation everyone is familiar with. short term episode are unlikely to harm us. longer term however, it can be debilitating. remember there is help out there for those time you need support in getting back on top of things.**",stress

34,"i know life is supposed to be difficult. i know stressful thing can happen, and that most of u learn how to cope in a healthy way. eating right and exercising are supposed to make u healthy and happy, both physically and mentally. we're supposed to have hobby (beginner at knitting) to keep u occupied and to do our duties, which manifest in the job that i do almost every day. we need to have a network of support from friend and family. life isn't just what happens to you, it's how you react to it. that's what i tell myself.

yet it seems that life, or at least my life, is just one stressful event after another. be it getting rear-ended and struggling with insurance for a few months, a single parent's boyfriend showing up who stress you out for the next few, transferring from one branch to another in your job, looming deadlines, and the knowledge that you have to eat healthily and sleep at least 8 hour a night or you're going to get sick...etc. etc. etc. many time i'm happy and i catch myself wondering when the next bad thing is going to happen. without fail, it does. i deal with it successfully, and it's on to the next one! over and over and over again, catching moment of pleasure and peace in between. it's not a very good comparison, but it's kind of like dark souls, where you die your way through instead of playing your way through.

i'm slowly being chipped away at. i've built an extraordinarily healthy way of living, but it seems at this point that it's just a tower i've built over a foundation under continuous assault by the element that i'm constantly repairing.

i've been tired. so tired. it's like i died a long time ago, and i'm only 23. i know everybody deal with constant stressors, so is everyone secretly feeling this way? is it all drowned in alcohol? drugs? religion? are we supposed to naturally numb ourselves with age? this can't be all that life is!

my grandfather eats junk food. he stand or sits around for most of the day and sometimes he go for a walk before coming home and eating. he's been through the vietnam war and lost almost everything. despite sleep apnea, cancer, a fat-rich diet, and falling once, he's still thriving in his eighties. no one get to that point unless they've got it all figured out inside.

there's something obvious i'm missing, something that appears to make all the difference. i don't think a girlfriend will fix this, nor will any big purchase or materialism. ideally, i'd have a life of inner peace and contentment, filled with steady but peaceful determination. otherwise, life ha no meaning to it.",stress

i had been working in a shitty workplace. the pay ain't bad but to deal with my bos terrible management and temperament which make his employee turnover rate is so high .people would stay around for a week up to 3-4 months, with the group chat kept having people leave and join. a of now there are around 15 people who have come and gone which i seen since the first day i joined and worked here up until now. i heard that this business ha been running for 4-5 year now but from what i seen is almost like an enterprenuerial business with no idea and direction they wanted to do a they have tutoring, selling board games/blind box and even large figurine tradings, throwing menial task at every employee with focus on trying to get more employee to join. i worked around 11-12 hour on average so it make me stressed at first.

then a few day ago when i got home from work (around 11pm almost midnight) my dad called me in to have a talk with him, then he explains that he's worried about my health and my body health. at first i didn't think about it much. me and my father didn't go well for a long time so i think of it more a of a warning, however it turned to make me angry and stressed a he simulate what will happen to me by imagining if i were turned into a disabled person and unable to move at all, with me still able to talk. i got so stressed and tired enough that i didn't get enough sleep after i finally got to excuse myself.

thanks in advance. recently i tried losing weight: i go to the gym at least four day a week, i stopped drinking soda's on a daily basis and i eat le snack and junk food before, during or after lunch. it's an advancement for me, but i realise it is not really enough to make the step i need to make.

one reason is that food is my 'happy place': whenever i have stress due to my education at uni, or my work schedule or my failing dating and social life, i can eat food and feel better.  i frequently describe it a one of the highlight of my day. anyhow, on another sub people adviced me to see my problem of losing weight in the amount i want a a problem of reducing stress. so that's what i do.

i tried a lot already to reduce stress: going to the gym, not working at nights, try to communicate with someone before embarking on over-ambitious projects, spending le time on my education and trying to stay at home more often to avoid having to travel a lot. still, here i am.  would you have any advice or experience that could help me improve my stress management techniques?",stress

guessing and there just seem to be no woman who arent partiers or who would let me be myself with them . or maybe im looked at a asexual or unattractive. anyways i just need something more exciting than just work and home . i wish i had a group o could do thing with but of course my schedule make it tough .

my dating/sex history:
i wa never very good at asking woman out even though most of my life i wa told i wa extremely handsome im tall 61 blonde hair , brown eye . i wa told i could have modeled when i wa younger . anyway i didnt lose my virginity till i wa 20 which is late but partly because i wa shy , just not confident. i had an opportunity to be that girl boyfriend who i lost my virginity to but i just decided i didnt want a relationship with her , well between 2007 and 2009 i had no heterosexual sex but desired it but wa insecure, etc . ill admit because i grew up in san francisco and had gay friend i even experimented with gay men a a way out since i wa just not having relationship with woman but i realized obviously i wa not gay or bi since i didnt feel attracted to men . than im 2010 i had sex with a drunk cougar and that wa one and done . i had a disasterous date with a woman in the mission district in sf and it wa horrible. i than tried going to  cougar bar with my friend but of course we would never go home with anyone, and it wasnt my scene anyway. than in 2012 i met my first girlfriend who wa older than me at a class. funny thing is i liked her immediately and she clearly liked me . we saw the batman dark knight movie which wa our first date in 2012. well we fucked like crazy so much so that i felt it wa a bit much and the non sexual side of our relationship seemed kinda ehhh.
well i eventually drove her away and regretted it . and since then ive slept with a few older woman from 2015-2019. but since covid ive had no sex except masturbation . partly i still do struggle with being insecure and feeling like woman will never be into me which i know is nonsense of course . but i am now have a strange sense of being torn on one hand i would like to be in a relationship, on the other hand my life is busy enough with work and exploring stuff in la with my camera . i almost feel like the woman would have to be perfect for me because i feel like maybe my earlier history told me something that im just someone who lost their virginity late and because of it maybe it messed me up or maybe im better off just with a few friend and my own life . partly i think i need someone who i can be myself around them without judgment and im trying to change . maybe im just to weird or absent minded . i try to work on my confidence and i try to
fake it till i make it but that can only last so long . i do have confidence issue and while im secretive about it deep inside i feel like most woman are either judging me or think im unattractive , or that im gay. 

i guess i need to work on myself . i want to get back into shape , eat healthier, exercise like i used to . also i use to shave everyday clean shaven and short hair but when covid came i got lazy. im going to try and get myself together and work on myself. i take my medication for depression which help and i do have a therapist but i cant see her a much a id like . i do have challenge but i always try to work through them 

my issue with sex, relationships, asking woman out :
i have often had issue with asking woman out , etc. it weird maybe i am incel yet i dont blame my problem on woman i blame it all on myself that im my own worst enemy. i tend to shoot myself in the foot . it weird because i dont consider myself repressed. i grew up in a liberal household in san francisco. i also am not a right winger a most incels are . i am liberal . anyways so most men can ask a woman out with no problem and nothing would faze them . i on the other hand have trouble because i dont want to make a fool of myself, come off a creepy etc . good example is there is this customer at work who i like and come in most everyday . her and i talk quite a bit when im helping her and we smile at each other . and i think she like me , but probably just being friendly. two of my colleague know i like her and always ask  have you asked her out yet  i always give an excuse or that she wouldnt want to have anything to do with me that way.  so other guy could just ask a woman out with no issue but not me. also im not at my best right now and want to get back to being healthy and exercise. the funny thing is i can talk to beautiful woman because i do every day because i work in beverly hill and i can engage and be friendly but on my own i dont seek out to talk to woman because of my own fear a how they view me. the funny thing is i did ask my ex gf out but it wasnt really a date asking her out it wa more casual and thing developed. i just wonder if i can overcome these issue that have been plaguing me for a good chunk of my life . i just sometimes feel im cursed .h",stress

**how mindfulness replaces medication to reduce anxiety**

care work similarly a well a a prescription to check nervousness, concentrate on finds

a care contemplation course might be a successful at lessening uneasiness a a typical medicine, a per another review.

the exploration, distributed on november 9 in jama psychiatry, involved a gathering of 276 grown-ups with untreated uneasiness problems. a big part of the patient wa haphazardly chosen to take 10 to 20 mg of escitalopram, the nonexclusive type of lexapro, a typical medicine used to treat nervousness and wretchedness. the other half were relegated to an eight-week course in care-based pressure decrease.

the outcome were dazzling: the two gathering experienced about a 20% decrease in their tension side effect over the eight-week time span.

elizabeth hoge, the lead creator on the review and the overseer of the tension issue exploration program at georgetown college clinical center, let cnn know that she trust the examination can open up greater treatment choice for patient with uneasiness.

87,my in law ha been so controlling over my two boys. they try and basically tell me what i need to do and what not to do... sometimes they make me feel like i'm a bad mother! and it from thing like me sending my kid to public school to them getting the mandatory shot to attend school... or the fact that i don't doing anything with politics because it's not something i'm very educated with and that's because i never showed interest so their for i don't vote and they think i should just go vote for who they tell me to because it's my child future and i'm a bad person cause i dont. they make me feel like i'm going crazy!!! husband agrees with me and tell me to just let them go and let it be... but then theirs part of me that feel bad because my kid have a great bond with them. so i'm basically stuck in the middle of letting them out of my life and enjoy peace or just continue to allow their behavior so my boy are happy! there's so much more to it that's stressful.,stress

89,"or is it just me? 

i have two blood/circulatory, autoimmune disorder that are not that difficult to regulate, but can get annoying sometimes because i often have to go to more appointment than id like. also, depending on the job, i may have to ask for accommodations. 

the last manager that i asked for an accommodation basically insinuated that i wa lying, and even when i proved it with a doctor note, she wa still very rude about it, and acted like i wa asking for something ridiculous other than needing to get up every two hour and walk around for five minute because of my poor circulation. 

i have been let go in the past due to taking time off for medical conditions, but of course they dont say that it because of medical condition they just say im taking too much time off. so i cant claim ada discrimination. 

ive been at my new job for a little over a year now and they are so flexible and have no issue with me taking time off but of course i built up this wall because of previous job and im always terrified to ask for time off when i need to go to a doctor appointment. 

my doctor is like your health is more important than your job and you need to make this work so that you can do everything you need to do to handle your autoimmune diseases. obviously, my health is more important than a job but he doesnt think about the fact that company dont give a shit about health and if i lose my job due to taking time off, i wont be able to afford insurance or pay out-of-pocket for him.

90,"today is stress awareness day so i want to share some statistic and resource available for people suffering from stress:

&amp;#x200b;

* the most common cause of stress is work-related stress with 79% saying they frequently felt it. (statista)
* 74% of people feel so stressed they have been overwhelmed or unable to cope. (mental health foundation and yougov)
* 13.7 million working day are lost each year in the uk because of work-related stress, anxiety and depression, costing 28.3 billion yearly. (nice) 

tips to deal with stress:  
\-**explore your triggers**: keep a diary for one week to discover which situation increase your stress level the most.  
\-**practice time management**: trying to do everything at once isn't an effective way to handle stress a it usually take you longer to complete your tasks. ensure that you are organised by managing your time efficiently.  
**-set boundaries:** it's easy to be available 24 hour a day due to current technology. establish some boundary so work is distanced from your personal life.  
**-life outside of work:** to avoid experiencing burnout you must take some time to look after yourself and engage in activity you enjoy.  
**-build a support network:** speaking with and meeting up with friend and family can help you feel more positive and reduce your vulnerability to stress.  
**-focus on healthy habits:** avoid alcohol, caffeine and nicotine, get enough sleep, eat well and be active.

**-do a course:** there are plenty of course available that will teach you to understand the symptom and cause of stress, step you can take to deal with your stress and will help you practice dealing with stressful situation in the safety of exercises. for example, **virtualspeech** is offering a free trial for their managing workplace stress course and **futurelearn** also offer a workplace wellbeing course.",stress

93,"while fear, shock, and disgust are typically seen a negative emotion that we want to avoid, they can also be an enjoyable experience in certain situations.

horror movie are one of the best example of this. when youre watching a horror movie about ghosts, zombies, serial killers, aliens, or monsters, your nervous system naturally kick into gear a if youre experiencing a real threat from your environment.

**this** [**fight, flight, or freeze**](https://www.theemotionmachine.com/the-complete-guide-to-daily-stress/)**-response creates a biochemical rush of adrenaline, endorphins, and dopamine, which can create a type of natural high.**

however, while your body experience the natural high of a real threat, your brain know deep down that youre actually safe and secure  and there no real danger present.

one early [study](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/bf00995932) published in the journal *motivation and emotion* looked into why people enjoy eating really spicy food (such a chili peppers) and found a similar response.

chili enjoyer still feel the same irritation and pain of eating spicy food a everyone else, but they enjoy the rush of adrenaline and endorphin it produces. it stimulates the body warning system in a harmless and risk-free way that can be exciting and exhilarating.

this type of [positive thrill-seeking](https://www.theemotionmachine.com/positive-thrill-seeking/) can be found in many other relatively safe and harmless activities, such a riding rollercoasters, extreme sports, skydiving, an intense workout, or playing competitive video games.

**new psychology research show that the experience of negative emotion (in a safe and controlled context) can be very enjoyable and beneficial.**

one [study](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30307264/) published in the scientific journal *emotion* found that voluntarily arousing negative emotion (vane)  such a purposely making ourselves scared  can lead to an overall boost in mood, like when we watch a horror movie or visit a haunted house.

the study looked at individual who bought ticket for an extreme haunted house event, which wa designed to elicit a variety of negative emotion such a anxiety, fear, shock, and disgust.

after the haunted house experience, most individual reported an overall boost in euphoria and positive mood, especially if they felt tired, bored, or stressed beforehand.

while the sample is biased (people who buy ticket to haunted house are more likely to enjoy them), the study doe reveal that some people genuinely enjoy scaring themselves.

furthermore, the study found that individual who enjoyed the haunted house experience also showed le stress while completing subsequent cognitive and emotional test (including showing le reactivity in the brain during those tests, a measured by eeg recordings).

researchers theorize that voluntarily arousing negative emotion (vane) can teach u how to better deal with future stress and anxiety.

this is a common technique behind a lot of *exposure therapy*, where a person is gradually put into a fearful situation so they become more desensitized to some irrational fear or phobia. for example, a person scared of flying may be asked by a therapist to visualize themselves getting on a plane until they learn to manage their fear better.

by actively exposing ourselves to fear, shock, or disgust in a safe and controlled way, we get to practice regulating these emotion in the moment, which is an important pillar of [emotional intelligence](https://www.theemotionmachine.com/4-fundamental-pillars-of-emotional-intelligence/).

**horror movies** ***simulate*** **extraordinary experience that we normally wouldnt have in the real world. when we watch a horror movie, we put ourselves in the protagonist position and ask ourselves,** ***what would i do in this situation?***

new research show fan of horror movie may even be more prepared to face real-world catastrophes.

one fascinating [study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/pmc7492010/) published in *personality and individual differences* discovered that fan of horror movie and pandemic movie were more resilient during the covid pandemic. it wa also found that fan of prepper genre in particular (alien-invasion, apocalyptic, and zombie films) exhibited both greater resilience and preparedness.

this is one reason why pandemic movie such a *contagion* and *28 day later* showed a huge spike in popularity during covid.

ultimately, horror movie give u a chance to face our fear and practice [mentally rehearsing](https://www.theemotionmachine.com/mental-rehearsal-changing-habits-through-the-power-of-visualization/) how we would respond in extremely intense situations. a the famous horror writer stephen king once said, a good horror story help u understand our own deepest fears.",stress
